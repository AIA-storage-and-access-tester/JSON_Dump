"auther": "Daniel Moss", "body": "As mentioned in previous report, the haven-associated US Dollar may continue to lose ground against its major counterparts, as long-term price analysis suggests a cyclical downturn is in the offing. \n\nDXY monthly chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe chart above highlights the cyclical pattern seen in the US Dollar Index over the past 34 years, with the DXY largely adhering to what appears to be a 16-year rotation. The index set significant bottoms in 1992 and 2008. \n\nAfter bottoming out, price then seems to rebound aggressively early in the cycle, soaring 24.1% and 26.8% in 1993 and 2009 respectively, before pulling back to key support at the 88.6% Fibonacci. A 6-year period of sustained USD strength follows this counter-trend pullback, with price climbing 50.1% from the 1995 low and 42.8% from the 2011 low, to set key highs in 2001 and 2017. \n\nBearish RSI divergence in late 2002 seemed to signal the end of the US Dollar\u2019s bull run and triggered a shift in overall market sentiment, as price collapsed through uptrend support and ell 41.6% to eventually bottom in March 2008. \n\nRecent price action and the development of the RSI is strikingly similar to that seen in the first quarter of 2003 and could be indicative of further downside for the DXY, as price slices through the September 2020 low (91.75) and hurtles towards the 2018 low (88.25). \n\nAn extended downside push towards the 100% Fibonacci expansion (83.50) looks likely if the 2018 low is breached, with cycle analysis suggesting price could fall a further 23% from current levels before bottoming out in mid-2024. \n\nAUD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nThe longer-term technical outlook for AUD/USD remains overtly bullish, as price surges above the August 2020 high (0.7413) to challenge the psychologically imposing 0.7800 mark. \n\nWith the MACD hovering at its highest levels since 2011, and the RSI eyeing a push into overbought territory, the path of least resistance seems higher. \n\nA bullish \u2018golden cross\u2019 moving average formation also hints at extended gains for the exchange rate in the coming months. \n\nA weekly close above 0.7810 is required to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and clear a path for price to challenge the 2018 high (0.8136). Hurdling that likely brings the 100% Fibonacci (0.8918) into the crosshairs. \n\nHowever, if 0.7800 successfully stifles buying pressure, a short-term pullback to the yearly low (0.7564) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 38.14% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.62 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 20.49% higher than yesterday and 0.10% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 10.93% higher than yesterday and 13.40% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests AUD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is less net-short than yesterday but more net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed AUD/USD trading bias.\n\nNZD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nNZD/USD rates also seem poised to continue pushing higher, as price storms away from the support range at 0.7100 \u2013 0.7130. \n\nThe development of the RSI hints at swelling bullish momentum, as the oscillator continues to track the uptrend extending from the March lows and eyes an entry into overbought territory.\n\nA weekly close above 0.7250 likely paves the way for buyers to drive the exchange rate towards the 61.8% Fibonacci (0.7333). Breaching that opens to door for a challenge of the 2017 high (0.7558). \n\nConversely, failing to break above the psychologically imposing 0.7300 mark could allow sellers to force NZD/USD back towards the yearly low (0.7096). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 39.33% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.54 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 15.38% higher than yesterday and 17.10% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 9.95% higher than yesterday and 2.21% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests NZD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current NZD/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nUSD/CAD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nUSD/CAD looks set to extend recent losses, as price continues to track within the confines of a Descending Channel. \n\nA \u2018death cross\u2019 moving average formation, in combination with the RSI dipping to its lowest levels since 2017, suggests the path of least resistance is lower. \n\nPiercing range support at 1.2555 \u2013 1.2590 likely intensifies selling pressure and clears a path for price to challenge the 2018 low (1.2247). \n\nHowever, if support remains intact, a rebound back towards channel resistance and the 21-EMA could be in the offing (1.2599). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 72.92% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.69 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 11.33% higher than yesterday and 8.63% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 37.76% higher than yesterday and 19.61% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests USD/CAD prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is less net-long than yesterday but more net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed USD/CAD trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD tests recent ranges following USD rebound", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jpDnrc69C.mEvYUEtArlHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/5d45abd22f60a61155a0beab70560d4a", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "The Australian dollar drifted lower through trade on Wednesday, depressed by weakness across equities and a slew of stronger than anticipated US macroeconomic data sets. Having given up 0.78 US cents, the AUD remained largely range bound through the domestic session bouncing between 0.7740 and 0.7770 before marking fresh daily and weekly lows at 0.7725 following a massive upward surprise in US retail sales. Having disappointed in December, US consumers turned out in January marking a 5.1% uptick in spending; well above the 1% anticipated. The strong print was supported by gains in PPI inflation, industrial production and home sales which suggest the US economy is stronger than first anticipated. Having drifted back toward 0.7750 on open, our attentions now turn to domestic employment data. The monthly labour market report remains a crucial measure of recovery and a key marker for the RBA. Material improvements in job creation and a depreciation in unemployment would likely mean the RBA current QE program will not extend beyond September, while a poor print ahead of relaxed Jobseeker and JobKeeper benefits, next month may prompt calls for extend stimulus, weighing on the AUD. We anticipate an improvement and reduction to 6.4%.\n\nThe dollar index advanced through trade on Wednesday up 0.3% following higher bond rates and stronger than anticipated domestic retail sales. Following a soft showing in December, consumer spending rebounded strongly in January up 5.1% month on month, well beyond the 1.1% growth anticipated and raising some concerns inflation pressures may accelerate as fiscal stimulus is introduced to the economy. The dollar advanced against both the GBP and euro driving the index higher. Sterling drifted below 1.39 and touched 1.3830 before settling above 1.3850 into this morning\u2019s open. The euro slipped below 1.21 forced to lows at 1.2030.

Employment data showed employment levels are returning to near pre-pandemic levels, with the unemployment rate falling below 6.5% to 6.4% as another 30,000 jobs were added to the economy. The outlook continues to improve with most industries now reporting almost full employment, with job losses now targeted to those worst hit by the pandemic, namely tourism and entertainment. As the vaccine roll-out begins this month, there is hope forward indicators will show further growth moving into Q2, easing pressure on the RBA to maintain long run QE programs.\n\nWith little of note on the domestic docket our attentions turn to a raft of European and US PMI data. Markets are pricing in some slippage through February as lockdowns and frigid weather temper economic activity. We are keenly attuned to any divergence in economic performance; softness across European data sets could force the single currency back toward 1.20 and allow the AUD to test resistance at 0.6450.\n\nVolatility across currency markets remained subdued through trade on Thursday with little headline newsflow or data points to spark a wholesale shift in direction. The US dollar drifted lower against the euro, yen and pound with the latter extending its upward run toward 3-year highs. Sterling remains a target for investors and analysts, marking fresh highs at 1.3985 overnight.

With little to digest at home, the Aussie took direction from offshore outperforming early in the week. Initially the Aussie advanced as the Greenback's recent resurgence faltered in the face of rising inflation concerns spurred on by a potentially overzealous stimulus package. With the proposed package some 9% of GDP on top of the 4% of GDP proposed before Christmas there are concerns that inflation will take off. Despite the concerns, the 1-year inflation expectations figure failed to meet expectations and only rose to 1.21%, albeit still almost a yearly high for the report. Closer to home, Melbourne again entered a COVID-19 related lockdown, although for a proposed 5 days this time. Ultimately the news capped the Aussie's movements on Friday, although the broader market was sluggish in general due to Chinese New Year celebrations and a looming public holiday today in the US, Presidents' Day. Moving into a new week, the Aussie is set to enjoy a very quiet domestic docket initially with direction again to be driven by the Greenback.\n\nThe US dollar again took centre stage last week with the Greenback's behaviour dictating broader market movements. Spurred on first by rising treasury yields and lower than expected inflation levels, the Greenback initially consolidated against a basket of currencies but ultimately weakened as Federal Reserve head Powell and later US Treasury Secretary Yellen both displayed a dovish tone. The Greenback was also sold-off throughout the week as inflation concerns crept into the stimulus conversation. Nevertheless, the US dollar opens this morning at 90.45 on the US DXY and is up 0.16 against the Japanese yen and 0.07% against the Swiss franc.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the British pound turned out to be one of the better performers for the week after Q4 GDP rose by double market expectations at 1% q/q. Helped along by a softer Greenback and reports that the UK is starting to make headway in the infection rate, the Sterling rose an impressive 0.8% for the week and opens this morning at 1.3845.\n\nAUD/CAD: 0.9773 - 0.9920 \u25b2\n\nAUD/EUR: 0.6342 - 0.6437 \u25b2\n\nGBP/AUD: 1.7713 - 1.7980 \u25b2\n\nAUD/NZD: 1.0663 - 1.0824 \u25b2\n\nAUD/USD: 0.7701 - 0.7818 \u25b2\n"}, {"headline": "US Dollar Price Action Setups: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, USD/JPY", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "19 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/7my6vELlhsolWkp4HPp58g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/063085c9015523ec17ebca884f284d8c", "auther": "James Stanley", "body": "It was a wash week in the US Dollar as the currency is looking to finish the week very close to where it had started. It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "Euro Forecast: Why Bulls Like EUR/JPY More Than EUR/USD", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/hD.CP8K5AknbE3Yvtv_VBA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/2b1579959f6ef2083a7f7d9790ce37ea", "auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "The world of FX is based on relativity, and relatively speaking, the EU is trailing other developed economies with its vaccination rates, and the EU is growing less robustly than other regions. By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "FOREX-Dollar in doldrums as vaccines fan recovery bets", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zjJP2QJtNAQrwghv2338HA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/f6990362d671426614d786ef03079407", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "U.S. Dollar Needs Retail Sales Comeback | Investing.com NG", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Kathy Lien", "body": "\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Currencies Reverse\u00a0Despite New Highs For Stocks\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 USD\u00a0Rallies On Stronger Empire State Survey But Retail Sales A Risk\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 EURO\u00a0Gives Up Gains Despite Stronger ZEW\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 AUD\u00a0Lower On Dovish RBA Minutes\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 GBP\u00a0Traders Look Ahead To Stronger CPI\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CAD\u00a0Sells Off Despite Prospect Of Stronger Inflation Data\n\u00a0\nU.S. traders came back from their long weekend on Tuesday ready for a busy trading week.

In doing so, the quote suspends challenges to the bulls raised by the recently published RBA minutes. The reason could be traced from the risk-on mood.\n\nWhile highlighting the importance of the extended Quantitative Easing (QE), the RBA board also mentioned about, per the Minutes, few signs of deterioration in home lending standards that would be monitored closely.\n\nRead:\u00a0RBA Minutes: \u201cVery significant\u201d monetary support to be needed for some time\n\nEven if the event matched wide market expectations, AUD/JPY traders tracked risk catalysts to the north while refreshing the highest since December 2018.\n\nWhile portraying the mood, S&P 500 Futures and Australia\u2019s ASX 200 rise 0.50% each whereas the US 10-year Treasury yields jump to the highest in 11 months by press time.\n\nBehind the moves could be the hopes of the US covid relief package and the recent positive developments over the coronavirus (COVID-19) and its vaccine. Herein Victoria\u2019s lockdown battles the optimism ahead of the mass vaccinations in Australia while the reduction in the infections in the UK and Israel after the immunization also keeps the market players hopeful. It should, however, be noted that the off in China probes the rally.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the comments from Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso as well as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, favoring the need for further easy monetary and fiscal policies, offered extra strength to the AUD/JPY moves.\n\nLooking forward, a light calendar and China\u2019s holidays will eye for fresh risk catalysts to extend the latest rally to a multi-month top.\n\nA sustained break of 82.20 becomes necessary for the bulls to eye for the September 2018 high near 82.50. However, AUD/JPY sellers are less likely to enter until witnessing a clear break below an ascending trend line from August 2020, at 81.62 now.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Australian Dollar Technical Forecast: AUD/USD, AUD/JPY, EUR/AUD", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "11 hours ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "James Stanley", "body": "It was a forceful show of strength for the Australian currency this week as AUD hit fresh yearly-highs against the major currencies of USD, JPY and the Euro. In a backdrop where loose for longer rules the day, the hues of optimism around Australia have helped to bring buyers to the bid, driving the currency so far for much of early-2021 trade and, bigger picture, since the pandemic lows were set last March. \n\nThe pair was already on its back foot coming into 2020 trade, reeling from a combination of weakness in the Australian economy along with a general hint of risk aversion that had helped to bring upon a stronger Japanese Yen. Of course, with looming trade wars in the background, \u2018risk on\u2019 sentiment was difficult to muster at the time, and as the coronavirus began to get priced-in to markets early last year, risk aversion reared its ugly head as AUD/JPY tested below the 60.00 level for the first time since the 2008 Financial Collapse. \n\nThat test was fleeting, however, as the psychological level helped to bring buyers back to the bid; and initially, this helped to slow the sell-off. \n\nTo learn more about how psychological levels can function as support/resistance, check out DailyFX Education\n\nAs the risk trade started to return with gusto in April and May, AUD/JPY moved along with it, reversing those prior losses and beginning to show signs of strength. And that theme largely continued through the 2021 open, at which point AUD/JPY began to find resistance around another psychological level at the 80.00 handle. \n\nThis led into back-and-forth price action in January and through the February open, and when I wrote up the Analyst Pick on this setup last week, that gyration had just begun to give way on short-term charts as the inverse head and shoulders pattern that had built on long-term charts began to give way. That breakout has continued to run through this week as AUD/JPY now trades at fresh two-year-highs. \n\nTo learn more about the head and shoulders pattern, and how it can lead to breakouts check out DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDJPY on Tradingview\n\nAt this point, traders not long AUD/JPY have the complicated conundrum of trying to work with an overbought trend after a fresh breakout. And while there\u2019s been ample motive for the development of this trend, there could be pullback potential into next week, and on the four-hour chart below, I\u2019ve identified two possible areas of higher-low support that can keep the door open for bullish trend scenarios. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDJPY on Tradingview\n\nAUD/USD Drives Towards .8000 Big Fig\n\nA similar conundrum presents itself in AUD/USD where a red-hot bullish trend has moved into an overbought state, making for a challenging backdrop to those looking to continue that move. But, similarly, pullbacks could be a possible way of moving forward here, looking to institute trend trading logic after the fresh breakout; and below I look into three different areas of possible higher-low support in AUD/USD. The nearest runs from .7820-.7836, with the deeper zone showing around .7708-.7728. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDUSD on Tradingview\n\nEUR/AUD Moves Towards Long-Term Trendline \n\nWhile the Euro hasn\u2019t been as generally weak as the US Dollar or the Japanese Yen since the pandemic began, more recently, the Euro has been seeing an increasing amount of pressure. But from this week the big takeaway was just how strong the Australian Dollar was and this reflects well in the EUR/AUD chart. \n\nFrom the monthly variety below, we can see where a long-term trendline has come into play this week as the pair has pushed down to fresh two-year-lows. If EUR/AUD does hold this line of support into next week, it could make for an interesting reversal play, particularly for those that are looking to fade this recent round of Aussie strength. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/AUD on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "US Dollar Price Action Setups: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, USD/JPY", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "19 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/7my6vELlhsolWkp4HPp58g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/063085c9015523ec17ebca884f284d8c", "auther": "James Stanley", "body": "It was a wash week in the US Dollar as the currency is looking to finish the week very close to where it had started. It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "Rising Yields Pressure Equities, ECB Minutes On The Agenda | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y JFD Team", "body": "USD performance G10 currencies\nUSD performance G10 currencies\nUSD performance G10 currencies\nMajor global stock indices performance\nMajor global stock indices performance\nMajor global stock indices performance\nJapan's Nikkei 225 4-hour chart technical analysis\nJapan's Nikkei 225 4-hour chart technical analysis\nJapan's Nikkei 225 4-hour chart technical analysis\nEUR/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis\nEUR/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis\nEUR/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\n"}, {"headline": "Weekly Round up Feb 14 2021", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/W_g5AXwSfhErw5QEf6z5Eg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/9aaa70d858e70def64ca4a4dec40d97e", "auther": "Brian Twomey", "body": "Overall, EUR/USD was the first currency in August 2020 to break above its 5 year average at 1.1300\u2019s then the 10 year average in December 2020 at 1.2100\u2019s.

A quick snapshot analysis it becomes bleeding obvious that the ratio is increasing at a rapid rate on par with the likes of the Global Financial Crisis and of the Dot Com Bubble.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scarier charts of the lot really come from the price to sales and price to book ratios.\n\nPrice to sales is the big bad having well a truly exceeded the stratosphere on its way to the moon. While its nice to revel in the current cycle of growth, it feels like it is the sweet spot for global equities.\n\nThese technical indicators have often forecast a bubble market in their history usually in tandem to the Buffett indicator. Much like inverted yield curves forecast the beginning of the end to economic expansion cycles, these ratio\u2019s give an eerily similar result for bubbles.\n\n\n\nThis brings me to the buffet indicator, the total of all US Stocks divided by the total Gross Domestic Product for the entire United States\u2026at its highest level ever achieved since over five decades\u2026\n\nDoes this mean that stocks are overbought, and valuations have overshot and are now running hot, pushing slowly into the needle? Not necessarily but it has my attention as a risk factor that needs to be considered constantly and that needs to be monitored as apart of my own trading.\n\nUnfortunately, the key difference that clouds the judgement of these sorts of technical indicators is the blank cheque(s) that keep being rolled out through fiscal and monetary policy. While we have been exposed to both in the past, it has never been so many trillions globally or even country specific before now, this clouds the ability of these indicators to accurately present their data.\n\nEven if the data is clouded, I am still going to heed the warning and hold and enter existing and new positions optimistically in the face of risk, but with a newly added daily routine.\n\nIn parting I will leave you with a warren Buffett quote for today\u2019s blog.\n\n(Be) \u201cfearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\u201d \u2013 Warren Buffett\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD Vs USD/JPY and the FX Cross Pair Divide", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/rNkBPK9aa9Jmz49Ee7qjAg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/1bc8588b51831e795c1f03b377aa14d3", "auther": "Brian Twomey", "body": "Overall currency markets are in the great deadlock between natural opposites EUR/USD and USD/JPY. Current USD/JPY at 105.74 trades 84 pips above its vital high/ low point at 104.89. This line is rising. EUR/USD trades around its current high /low point at 1.2039. This line moved 1 pip lower since yesterday\u2019s ECB at 10 A.M. EST. EUR/USD and USD/JPY achieved its crowning achievement by rhe great divide to currency pairs.\n\nUSD/CAD at 1.2600\u2019s and GBP/USD at 1.3800\u2019s or 1200 pips informs this distance is far to wide. GBP/USD trade to 1.4000\u2019s while USD/CAD was located at 1.2500\u2019s or 1500 pips assisted to diminish the distance yet 1200 pips informs a big move is ahead. Normal distance is 3 to 500 pips.\n\nFor the past four weeks as written, JPY cross pairs were and continue to trade in severely overbought territory. The degree of overbought is recognized as 500 pips from AUD/USD 0.7700\u2019s and AUD/JPY at 82.00\u2019s and 500 pips from NZD/USD 0.7100\u2019s to NZD/JPY 76.00\u2019s. Normal is in the vicinity of 100 to 200 pips maximum because NZD/USD and NZD/JPY are the exact same currency pairs much the same as AUD/USD and AUD/JPY.\n\nThe divide grows wider at 800 pips from GBP/USD 1.3600\u2019s to GBP/JPY at 147.00\u2019s and 700 pips from EUR/USD 1.2000\u2019s to 127.00\u2019s for EUR/JPY and normal is 100 to 200 because GBP/USD and GBP/JPY are the exact same currency pairs much the same as EUR/USD and EUR/JPY.\n\nUSD pairs EUR/NZD at 1.6700\u2019s trades 2500 pips to GBP/NZD 1.9200\u2019s. Normal trades around 1600 to 1800 pips and 700 pips off kilter.\n\nThe EUR/USD and USD/JPY relationship is distinguished by the massive and extreme divide between and among currency pair prices, particularly USD and overall cross pairs as the primary driver to current prices.\n\nToday\u2019s trade is presented as a two trade option by matching significant day trade support, resistance and levels. Short the highs and long the lows.\n\nUSD/JPY highs Vs EUR/USD Lows.\n\nUSD/JPY up target 106.43 vs EUR/USD 1.1985 lows.\n\nUSD/JPY 106.36 Vs EUR/USD 1.1998.\n\nUSD/JPY 106.29 V EUR/USD 1.2011\n\nUSD/JPY 106.16 Vs EUR/USD 1.2015\n\nUSD/JPY 106.09 Vs EUR/USD 1.2023\n\nUSD/JPY 106.03 Vs EUR/USD 1.2028.\n\nUSD/JPY 105.96 Vs EUR/USD 1.2034.\n\nEUR/USD Highs Vs USD/JPY lows\n\nEUR/USD 1.2107 Vs USD/JPY 105.37\n\nEUR/USD 1.2099 Vs USD/JPY 105.44\n\nEUR/USD 1.2091 Vs USD/JPY 105.51\n\nEUR/USD 1.2076 Vs USD/JPY 105.58\n\nEUR/USD 1.2068 Vs USD/JPY 105.63\n\nEUR/USD 1.2061 Vs USD/JPY 105.71\n\nEUR/USD 1.2053 Vs USD/JPY 105.79\n\nEUR/USD 1.2049 Vs USD/JPY 105.87.\n\nEUR/USD is a complete opposite pair to USD/JPY however prices never match pip for pip as the relationship runs 7.62 pips for EUR/USD Vs 6.62 for USD/JPY.As a side note all market prices especially Stock Indices are factored the exact same as a currency price. The difference is in the name and number yet its all the same.\n\nNot many pips trade anymore as the old days of trading therefore pips and profits are maximized by multiple longs and shorts per currency pair.

"auther": "Thomas Westwater", "body": "US equities moved higher last week as investors continued to bet on the global economic recovery, boosted by increased Covid vaccination rollouts, loose monetary conditions, and ongoing fiscal support. The small-cap Russell 2000 index gave the most impressive showing of the major ones, with a 2.51% weekly gain. A more notable development, however, is the collapse in volatility seen in the US markets, reflected by the CBOE S&P 500 Volatility Index (VIX) closing below 20, the lowest level since February 2020. \n\nThe collapse in volatility via the VIX \u2013 which is widely used as a \u201cfear gauge\u201d \u2013 follows a strong corporate earnings season. So far, financial results from S&P 500 companies have largely beat analysts\u2019 expectations. The week ahead will see another round of quarterly results cross the wires, with the commerce juggernaut Walmart scheduled to release its figures on Thursday. Still, even with upbeat earnings, some investors are blowing the horn over stretched valuations.\n\nStocks may have more fuel to continue running higher despite high valuations amid the ongoing support seen from central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve. In a speech to The Economic Club of New York last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell once again ensured investors that supportive conditions are here to stay for the time being. Long-dated Treasury yields ended the week higher, with the 30-year yield climbing above 2.0%, the loftiest mark since early 2020. \n\nData Source: BBG\n\nMonday, along with the entire upcoming week, will likely be a quiet one across the APAC region. Exchanges are closed in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea as traders and investors celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday. Foreign exchange volumes may also see less activity, which could possibly also translate to lower volatility across many currency pairs. Having said that, breaking headlines that could drive markets quickly risk being more volatile due to reduced levels of liquidity.\n\nConsequently, this week\u2019s economic events calendar is also lighter than usual but the front end of the week may see the New Zealand Dollar react to BusinessNZ\u2019s Performance of Services Index (PSI) report, set to cross the wires early Monday morning, according to the DailyFX Economic Calendar. Japan will also release its Q4 GDP data, with analysts expecting a 9.5% annualized increase, down from 22.9% in the previous quarter. \n\nDespite the holiday break and light economic data prints for the week ahead, AUD/NZD presents an interesting technical setup that may give way to actionable movement. The 23.6% Fibonacci retracement from the Dec \u2013 Jan move appears to have interrupted last week\u2019s rally. However, the immediate path higher appears poised for further upside. \n\nThat upside may soon find significant resistance, however. The 20- and 50-day Simple Moving Averages appear to be on course to complete a bearish cross this week, which could dent AUD sentiment and hinder further gains. Moreover, a trendline from the August swing high also poses a test for bulls.

A 6-year period of sustained USD strength follows this counter-trend pullback, with price climbing 50.1% from the 1995 low and 42.8% from the 2011 low, to set key highs in 2001 and 2017. \n\nBearish RSI divergence in late 2002 seemed to signal the end of the US Dollar\u2019s bull run and triggered a shift in overall market sentiment, as price collapsed through uptrend support and ell 41.6% to eventually bottom in March 2008. \n\nRecent price action and the development of the RSI is strikingly similar to that seen in the first quarter of 2003 and could be indicative of further downside for the DXY, as price slices through the September 2020 low (91.75) and hurtles towards the 2018 low (88.25). \n\nAn extended downside push towards the 100% Fibonacci expansion (83.50) looks likely if the 2018 low is breached, with cycle analysis suggesting price could fall a further 23% from current levels before bottoming out in mid-2024. \n\nAUD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nThe longer-term technical outlook for AUD/USD remains overtly bullish, as price surges above the August 2020 high (0.7413) to challenge the psychologically imposing 0.7800 mark. \n\nWith the MACD hovering at its highest levels since 2011, and the RSI eyeing a push into overbought territory, the path of least resistance seems higher. \n\nA bullish \u2018golden cross\u2019 moving average formation also hints at extended gains for the exchange rate in the coming months. \n\nA weekly close above 0.7810 is required to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and clear a path for price to challenge the 2018 high (0.8136). Hurdling that likely brings the 100% Fibonacci (0.8918) into the crosshairs. \n\nHowever, if 0.7800 successfully stifles buying pressure, a short-term pullback to the yearly low (0.7564) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 38.14% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.62 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 20.49% higher than yesterday and 0.10% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 10.93% higher than yesterday and 13.40% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests AUD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is less net-short than yesterday but more net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed AUD/USD trading bias.\n\nNZD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nNZD/USD rates also seem poised to continue pushing higher, as price storms away from the support range at 0.7100 \u2013 0.7130. \n\nThe development of the RSI hints at swelling bullish momentum, as the oscillator continues to track the uptrend extending from the March lows and eyes an entry into overbought territory.\n\nA weekly close above 0.7250 likely paves the way for buyers to drive the exchange rate towards the 61.8% Fibonacci (0.7333). Breaching that opens to door for a challenge of the 2017 high (0.7558). \n\nConversely, failing to break above the psychologically imposing 0.7300 mark could allow sellers to force NZD/USD back towards the yearly low (0.7096). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 39.33% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.54 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 15.38% higher than yesterday and 17.10% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 9.95% higher than yesterday and 2.21% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests NZD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current NZD/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nUSD/CAD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nUSD/CAD looks set to extend recent losses, as price continues to track within the confines of a Descending Channel. \n\nA \u2018death cross\u2019 moving average formation, in combination with the RSI dipping to its lowest levels since 2017, suggests the path of least resistance is lower. \n\nPiercing range support at 1.2555 \u2013 1.2590 likely intensifies selling pressure and clears a path for price to challenge the 2018 low (1.2247). \n\nHowever, if support remains intact, a rebound back towards channel resistance and the 21-EMA could be in the offing (1.2599). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 72.92% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.69 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 11.33% higher than yesterday and 8.63% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 37.76% higher than yesterday and 19.61% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests USD/CAD prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is less net-long than yesterday but more net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed USD/CAD trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "NZD/USD conquers 0.7300 level, eyes test of 2021 highs", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "19 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/oJ3hSBzhJKx6j9_X3vRuuA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/24ccc2331db8970621bf326716dd4a22", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "NZD/USD has been firmly on the front foot since the start of Friday\u2019s European trading session, rallying from Asia Pacific levels of just above the 0.7200 mark to now above 0.7300. The pair is thus within striking distance of the 2021 high set right at the start of January of just shy of the 0.7320 level. With gains of roughly 1.2% versus this US dollar, Friday is shaping up to be the kiwi\u2019s best since 9 October 2020.\n\nOn the week, the currency is now\u00a0vying for first place in the G10 ranking with GBP and AUD, all trading with weekly gains versus the US dollar of between 1.2-1.4%. On the month, NZD is the third-best performer after GBP and AUD, up about 2% versus USD.\n\nThe kiwi currently sits atop the G10 FX performance table, though specific news or events can be definitively pointed at as supporting the currency. For what its worth, Q4 PPI data released during Friday\u2019s Asia Pacific session did not appear to influence the price action much; input prices were unchanged in the quarter, down from growth of 0.6% in Q3, whilst Output price growth accelerated to 0.4% from its -0.3% contraction in Q3.\n\nMarkets have been in a generally risk-on mood on Friday and this is supporting risk-sensitive currencies such as NZD; stock markets are yet to take the recent run higher in global bond yields as a negative and the S&P 500 continues to trade comfortably above the 3900 level, not far from recent record levels. US President Joe Biden is expected to say that the US is not looking for a new cold war with China at the G7 summit, constructive commentary that may ease some concerns about the potential for relations to further deteriorate. Biden is still expected to call for democracies to challenge the country\u2019s abusive practises, however. Meanwhile, preliminary Markit PMI data for February out of Australia, the UK and US were decent, implying that the recovery in these countries remains on track as global vaccine rollouts continue. On which note, vaccine appears to lower Covid-19 infections and transmission rates by two-thirds, according to the Telegraph citing data set to be released later this month by Public Health England.\n\nWhilst the above is all very well and good for the kiwi, support also appears to be coming from movements in Australia and New Zealand\u2019s bond markets; yields in the former have surged since the start of the European session, with Australian 10-year bond yields currently up more than 7bps on the day at close to 1.49% following a change to Westpac\u2019s year-end bond yield forecast (which was revised higher to 1.9% from 1.5%. When New Zealand\u2019s bond markets re-open on Monday, similar upside is likely to be seen in bond yields there. That means the country\u2019s 10-year yield could be substantially higher than its Friday closing level at 1.517%, which was already amongst the highest yielding developed market 10-year notes.\n\nNZD/USD four hour chart\n\n\n"}, {"headline": "NZD/AUD \u2013 Battle Of The Interest Rates", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/vJgTB6LVqi16Y.Ak0KZqWA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/8d0d66de7297331639c2d32cede084d0", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "NZD/AUD is approaching a robust congested area at around 0.925. A downwards channel sees a possible move further lower may see the pair come a level below 0.9. However, an action lower will be dictated on which economy puts the brakes on monetary stimulus first.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDuring the peak of the Coronavirus, the best method of suppressing the virus was not evident. This is where Australia and New Zealand\u2019s strategies diverged.\n\nAustralia went for a loose lockdown, allowing citizens to roam freely without restricting them to their houses. They did enforce social distancing laws alongside mask-wearing.\n\nNew Zealand went for a strict lockdown, only allowing citizens to leave their house to exercise, get groceries and go to the doctors. Essential workers were given a pass to go to work.\n\nIt became evident as to what method was more successful. There were critics initially questioning New Zealand\u2019s method, pointing to the likes of Australia and Japan, who were getting similar results to New Zealand per capita, however, without the devastating economic cost of a lockdown. Those critics were soon to be silenced after New Zealand slowly pulled out their nearly six-week lockdown, well on their way to recovery. On the other hand, Australia had a devastating second wave that forced the inevitable \u2013 a strict lockdown. However, by then, New Zealand was back open and running.\n\nWith a head start in Australia\u2019s economic recovery, New Zealand has been showing signs of slowing its fiscal and monetary policy measures. Recently, The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) re-instated policies regarding mortgages issued by banks, which require house investors to front up 40% of the house sale price if they want to purchase a house. These were temporarily removed during the peak of the Coronavirus in 2020 to stimulate the economy. However, they were placed back after the national median price jumped up to $730,000, up 19.3%.\n\nHowever, a country that is heavily dependant on tourism is struggling due to the strict border controls. Westpac analysts predict New Zealand\u2019s GDP to fall 0.7 over the six months to March due to the lack of tourists. Dominick Stephens stated that \u201ctourism is highly seasonal, and there is normally a strong net inflow of people into the country in the summer months. The absence of visitors was felt keenly in the December quarter, and will be even more so in the March quarter, which would have otherwise been the peak tourist season.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAustralia has not had a good time dealing with the Coronavirus. Outsourcing security of their quarantine to a private company did not end well, with the spread of the virus being exacerbated by the security guards sleeping with the Coronavirus guests. This, alongside lax state line restrictions, pushed Coronavirus cases up, forcing two lockdowns. However, there is some optimism in the Australian economy, with many of their commodities\u2019 prices reaching all-time highs. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank of Australia stating that the \u201crecovery in the second half of 2020 had been faster than initially expected.\u201d\n\nI believe the economy that starts tapering monetary policy programs will first see their currency strengthen against the other. With the RBA stating that they are \u201ccommitted to doing what it reasonably could to support the Australian economy\u201d and that \u201csignificant monetary support would be required for some time,\u201d it looks like New Zealand in the mid to long term will be raising rates before Australia will, given the actions they took with loan-to-value ratios, alongside the consistent recovery from the Coronavirus.\n"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD tests recent ranges following USD rebound", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jpDnrc69C.mEvYUEtArlHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/5d45abd22f60a61155a0beab70560d4a", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "The Australian dollar drifted lower through trade on Wednesday, depressed by weakness across equities and a slew of stronger than anticipated US macroeconomic data sets.

Having disappointed in December, US consumers turned out in January marking a 5.1% uptick in spending; well above the 1% anticipated. The strong print was supported by gains in PPI inflation, industrial production and home sales which suggest the US economy is stronger than first anticipated.

The Kospi has also rallied strongly, rising 1.40%. Singapore has climbed 0.35% ahead of tomorrow\u2019s budget, with Kuala Lumpur up 0.45% and Jakarta\u2019s 0.35% higher. Australian markets are also claiming following trade winds, boosted by high commodity prices. The ASX 200 is up 0.95%, while the All Ordinaries has gained 0.85%.\n\nThe optimistic tone is likely to continue into Europe unless we get some negative headline surprises.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe US dollar retreats in Asia\n\nThe dollar index finished almost unchanged on Friday, as the rise in US yields offset rotational flows on global recovery sentiment. In Asia though, the US stimulus-led recovery hopes have reasserted themselves, with the dollar index falling 0.11% to 90.31 today.\n\nThe gains against the greenback have been most notable in the more cyclical developed market space. GBP/USD has risen 0.40% to 1.3900, and it seems likely to test 1.4000 this week. The impressive pace of the UK vaccination programme versus Europe lifting hopes of an earlier recovery.\n\nOn the same theme, the cyclical AUD/USD has risen 0.30% to 0.7785, NZD/USD has risen 0.28% to 0.7240 with USD/CAD falling 0.20% to 1.2668. The chart structures for AUD, NZD and CAD are all constructive, and all three are set for gains this week as long as the stimulus/recovery narrative remains intact.\n\nAsian currency trading has been muted by the China holiday, but regional currencies have also booked gains on the recovery narrative. Offshore USD/CNH has fallen 0.20% to 6.40.70 and the Indonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringgit and Singapore dollar are all higher this morning as well.\n\nWith US markets closed today, the US dollar will continue to remain on the back foot. Markets will continue concentrating on rotation out of the greenback, and into global economic expansion positioning.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes only.

receding dollar\u2019s demand. The pair fell in the American session undermined by the sour tone of US indexes, which posted substantial losses. Earlier in the day, the monthly Australian employment report showed that the country added 29.1K new jobs in January vs 50K expected, although the unemployment rate contracted from 6.6% to 6.4%.\n\nEarly on Friday, Australia will release the preliminary estimates of the Commonwealth Bank PMIs. Services output is foreseen improving from 55.6 to 55.8 while manufacturing activity is expected to tick higher from 57.2 to 57.3. The country will also publish the preliminary estimate of January Retail Sales, seen up 2%.\n\nAUD/USD Short-Term Technical Outlook\n\nThe AUD/USD pair fell intraday to 0.7730, but given the greenback\u2019s weakness, the pair got to bounce from the mentioned low to the current 0.7760 price zone, where it stands as the day comes to an end. The near-term picture is neutral, given that, in the 4-hour chart, the pair is struggling around a directionless 20 SMA while above the longer ones.

Initial Jobless Claims are expected to decline from 793,000 to 765,000 while Continuing Jobless Claims are projected to decrease from 4.54 million to 4.41 million.\n\nAUD/USD managed to settle above 0.7740 and is trying to settle above the resistance at 0.7760. If this attempt is successful, AUD/USD will move towards the next resistance level at 0.7780.\n\nA successful test of the resistance at 0.7780 will open the way to the test of the next resistance which is located at 0.7800. In case AUD/USD gets above the resistance at 0.7800, it will head towards the resistance at the yearly highs at 0.7820.\n\nOn the support side, the nearest support level for AUD/USD is located at 0.7740. If AUD/USD gets below this level, it will move towards the next support level near the 20 EMA at 0.7725. A move below the 20 EMA will push AUD/USD towards the support at 0.7700.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  Crude Oil Bulls hold Ace High, on Prevailing Bullish Dynamics in Play \n-  3 Silver Stocks with a Shiny Outlook \n-  February 18th 2021: Greenback Extends Gains Amidst Upbeat Economic Data \n-  GBP/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Support At 1.3835 In Sight \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 WTI Jumps after API Report with Sights Set on $62.64 \n-  EUR/USD Vs USD/JPY and the FX Cross Pair Divide \n"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD Forecast: Nearing The Multi-Year High Set Last January At 0.7819", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Benzinga via Yahoo Finance", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/k.jn_ABQLW_Mf5ISlNSR5w--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/Benzinga/e090c04ffd57061432e48920d52d8b18", "auther": "Valeria Bednarik", "body": "AUD/USD Current Price: 0.7784\n- The Bank of Australia will publish the Minutes of its February meeting.\n- AUD/USD is nearing the multi-year high set last January at 0.7819.\n\nThe AUD/USD pair maintained its bullish stance, reaching a fresh one-month high of 0.7788.

That being said, the next big target will be the 0.80 level, an area that of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and would attract quite a bit of attention.\n\nWith that being said, I believe that what we are seeing here is an expression of the commodity trade, and the fact that copper markets had gained 3% early in trading. That is a major export of Australia, and recently we have seen some of the major companies in Australia report Blockbuster earnings due to iron sales in China.\n\nIn other words, the commodity trade is \u201cfull on\u201d and people are looking to get exposure one way or the other. The Australian dollar of course is highly sensitive to all of these markets, and therefore it makes perfect sense that we would continue to see people interested in this market. For what it is worth, we have just broken above the top of the flag that measures for a potential move all the way to the 0.86, although I do think that the area 0.80 is going to take a lot of effort to get through.\n\nIn other words, we will more than likely be positive, but I suspect we will also be very choppy at one point or another. I anticipate that the market will probably behave at the 0.80 level the same way it did at 0.78 over the last month.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Testing 200 Day EMA \n-  EUR/USD Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Euro Finds Support at Crucial Level \n-  Natural Gas Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Natural Gas Markets Give Up Gains \n-  Oil Price Fundamental Daily Forecast \u2013 Lighter Refinery Demand Expectations Weighing on Prices \n-  Gold Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Gold Markets Pull Back to Test Support \n-  EUR/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Euro Runs Into Overhead Resistance \n"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into...", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "21 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/86VZpAeu4cGVbVso2td9Tw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/2b4503ae6bd3433a7552bffe35085217", "auther": "James Hyerczyk", "body": "The Australian Dollar is trading near a three-year high on optimism about an economic rebound in the country and as the U.S. Dollar continued to be pressured by Thursday\u2019s disappointing weekly initial claims report.\n\nThe Aussie is trading at its highest level since March 2018. The currency, which is closely linked to commodity prices and the outlook for global growth, has been helped by a recent rally in commodity prices.\n\nAt 13:56 GMT, the AUD/USD is trading .7863, up 0.0093 or +1.20%.\n\nThe U.S. currency had been rising in recent days as a jump in Treasury yields on the back of the so-called reflation trade drew investors.

Both are expected to remain in expansion territory, but may nudge lower than the previous month.\n\nThe main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. The uptrend was reaffirmed earlier today when buyers took out a pair of main tops at .7805 and the high for the year at .7820.

First-time filings for unemployment insurance jumped last week in a sign of continuing strife for the labor market. New claims totaled 861,000, the highest level in a month and above the Dow Jones estimate of 773,000 the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nYields on Australian 10-year bonds have surged 19 basis points this week, the biggest jump since last June, to reach an 11-month high of 1.425%.\n\nAdditionally, the Aussie was supported by rising commodity prices as China returned from holiday, with copper the highest in eight years and tin at a nine-year peak. Iron ore, Australia\u2019s single biggest export earner, surged above $170 a tonne and is delivering a windfall to mining profit and government tax revenue.\n\nAt 03:36 GMT, the AUD/USD is trading .7763, down 0.0007 or -0.10%.\n\nThe main trend is up according to the daily swing chart, however, momentum has been trending lower since the formation of the closing price reversal top on Tuesday and its subsequent confirmation the next session.\n\nA trade through .7805 will negate the closing price reversal top and signal a resumption of the uptrend. The main trend will change to down on a move through .7564. This is highly unlikely but there is room to the downside for a normal 50% to 61.8% correction.\n\nThe minor range is .7805 to .7724. The AUD/USD is currently straddling its 50% level at .7764.\n\nThe short-term range is .7820 to .7564. The AUD/USD is currently trading on the strong side of its retracement zone at .7722 to .7692.\n\nThe next short-term range is .7564 to .7805. Its 50% level at .7685 is another potential downside target.\n\nThe early price action suggests the direction of the AUD/USD on Friday will be determined by trader reaction to .7764.\n\nA sustained move under .7764 will indicate the presence of sellers. If this move creates enough downside momentum then look for a break into .7724 \u2013 .7722. If the latter fails as support then look for the selling to possibly extend into .7713, followed closely by .7692.\n\nA sustained move over .7765 will signal the presence of buyers. If this generates enough upside momentum then look for a test of this week\u2019s high at .7805. Taking out this level will reaffirm the main trend.

As I write this, the best-known and most-valuable cryptocurrency trades above $47,000, down modestly from an all-time high set on Thursday morning.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBitcoin now has roughly tripled since November, and rallied more than 50% this year. And the optimism makes some sense.\n\nNotably, corporations are increasingly comfortable with adopting Bitcoin. BTC saw a big catalyst this week when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said it would buy $1.5 billion of the crypto. The electric vehicle giant follows earlier adopters like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and payment companies Square (NYSE:SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe run over the last four months continues what has been an incredible rally. Bitcoin only launched in 2009. It cleared $1 (yes, one dollar) for the first time almost exactly a decade ago. Give or take, BTC has appreciated 4,700,000% in ten years. There have been few assets in the history of mankind to show that kind of appreciation. Simply put, Bitcoin has created millionaires.\n\nBut the rally hasn\u2019t been without volatility. In fact, volatility and crashes both have been a key part of the Bitcoin experience. Many of those crashes started in environments similar to this one: when all seemed well, and further upside appeared almost guaranteed.\n\nThat history suggests another reversal is almost certain to occur. That doesn\u2019t mean investors need to rush to sell their BTC immediately, but at the least they should be on their guard.\n\nFor skeptics (and I remain one of them), early 2021 looks an awful lot like late 2017.\n-  9 Meme Stocks That Social Media Won't Shut Up About \n\nAt that time, Bitcoin similarly was soaring. Bitcoin cleared $1,000 on New Year\u2019s Day 2017. By December, it was over $18,000. $20,000 and beyond seemed guaranteed. Cryptos of all kinds were rallying. Initial coin offerings were all the rage.\n\nBut as good as 2017 was, 2018 was nearly as bad. In U.S. dollars, Bitcoin had been halved by February. By the end of 2018, it was back below $4,000.\n\nAs an article at the time noted, the 2018 decline was not the first huge drawdown the cryptocurrency had seen. Not even close. In 2012, BTC dropped 49% twice, with one of the declines a three-day, 57% punishment. Another three-day period the following year saw an incredible 83% plunge.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2013, BTC lost half its value. Later that month, it began a stretch of over a year in which it went from $1,163 to just $152.40.\n\nEven in 2017, a banner year, Bitcoin fell 30% or more five different times. And then there was the roughly 80% plunge that began toward the end of that year.\n\nAdmittedly, of late the volatility has eased somewhat relative to early trading. Wider adoption and a larger investor base should continue that moderation going forward.\n\nStill, we\u2019ve seen this before. Bitcoin can move north in a hurry, but it also can move, and has moved, south at roughly the same pace.\n\nAnd there are a pair of catalysts that could trigger another decline in 2021.\n\nThe first is simply the parabolic gains not just in BTC, but across asset classes. We\u2019ve seen a number of stocks go crazy. That doesn\u2019t just include miners like Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Marathon Patent (NASDAQ:MARA). It even goes beyond the so-called \u201cReddit stocks\u201d like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).\n\nCommodities have taken off. Even in cryptos, DogeCoin, which started as a joke, now has a market capitalization of $9 billion.\n\nThere are going to be crashes elsewhere, whether in cryptos, stocks, or commodities. And those crashes may well read across to Bitcoin. Surely there is cross-ownership between Bitcoin and other \u2018hot\u2019 assets. Those owners that see losses elsewhere are likely to de-risk by converting BTC to USD.\n\nThere\u2019s also the regulatory environment. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has repeatedly and publicly raised concerns about cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin.\n\nCertainly, Yellen can\u2019t ban BTC trading and send its value to zero. But she can impact potentially bullish catalysts, like the long-awaited launch of an exchange-traded fund (which would need to be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission).\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the possibility that Bitcoin itself simply has run too far. It stands to reason that at least some of the incremental buyers since December are not diehard crypto adherents, who believe Bitcoin can disintermediate large financial institutions. They\u2019re just joining in the fun.\n\nIn modern trader parlance, there may be some \u201cweak hands\u201d that have jumped on board. They\u2019re not necessarily the type to ride out volatility longer-term.\n\nIt bears repeating: these risks don\u2019t mean an investor needs to rush to cash in their Bitcoin. In fact, for a couple of reasons, an investor can believe that both a) Bitcoin will crash again and b) Bitcoin still is worth owning right now.\n\nFirst, the crash may still be a long ways off \u2014 and more upside may follow. An analyst could have correctly predicted in early 2017 that BTC was going to crash within a year. A trader who listened to that advice still would have missed out on gains of at least 200%-plus. This rally doesn\u2019t have to end immediately.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s a case that trying to time the crash (assuming it arrives) is a fool\u2019s errand. Timing the stock market is a notoriously impossible strategy. Bitcoin\u2019s history suggests it isn\u2019t any different.\n\nLong-term bulls on Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) can reasonably argue that immense volatility simply is a fact of life, at least for now. But if the long-term bull case plays out, the ability to ride out that immense volatility will pay off, even if there\u2019s some short-term pain along the way.\n\nNeither is an unreasonable argument. But crypto holders need to at least understand that we\u2019ve been here before. Short-term bursts of optimism like we\u2019re seeing now almost always are followed by a reversal. I don\u2019t believe this time will be any different, though it remains to be seen how steep that reversal is, and from what point it begins.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vince Martin did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. \n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  Top Stock Picker Reveals His Next Potential Winner \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD. And we see 2,342 to be the next target for ETH/USD for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Support Zone with $1775.00 Setting the Tone \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into .7916 \n-  NZD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Strengthens Over .7232, Weakens Under .7206 \n-  Stocks Move Higher Despite Rising Bond Yields \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin market value reaches $1trn as price hits fresh highs", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "1 hour ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zeu22Odpj5XHCTCZ1cYxWw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/ec302b10-735b-11eb-bdef-5dcccf496414", "auther": "LaToya Harding", "body": "The market value of all Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in circulation hit $1trn (\u00a3710bn) for the first time ever on Friday night after the price of each individual coin surpassed $56,000, data website CoinMarketCap revealed.\n\nThe cryptocurrency extended its stellar two-month rally, rising to a record $56,620, meaning it has surged more than 92% this year alone.

A word to the wise before jumping in is warranted.\n\nAs we\u2019ve witnessed throughout crypto\u2019s re-emergence to all-time-highs, investors still need to be prepared for wild price action which can induce second-guessing, run-for-the-exits sell orders at the expense of one\u2019s trading account. But is there another way to participate with more defined exposure?\n\nToday, let\u2019s examine three behind-the-scenes crypto stocks within this burgeoning market. Instead of just being wise to the challenges and potential failures ahead, these Nasdaq-listed digital currency plays are offering smarter money strategies which won\u2019t extend or put the wallet at unnecessary and outsized risk.\n- Bit Digital (NASDAQ:BTBT)\n- Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n- Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN)\n\n Source: Charts by TradingView\n\nThe first of our crypto stocks to buy are shares of Bit Digital. According to Yahoo Finance the company engages in Bitcoin mining and recently changed its name from Golden Bull to better reflect its business activities. Despite being a fairly new entrant into the space, New York-based BTBT is one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies listed on Nasdaq.\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m always suspect of a company name change and business pivot of this kind. And being lured into a long stock position by year-over-year quarterly sales growth of around 64,000% isn\u2019t a great idea. The fact is revenues for the latest period came in at $13 million compared to a valuation of nearly $850 million for this crypto. It\u2019s steep. Bit Digital also remains in the red.\n\nStill, investors are buying in to the BTBT stock story in a big way and it looks worthy of calculated exposure.\n\nTechnically, Bit Digital recently broke out of a massive corrective cup-shaped base to new all-time-highs to finish off 2020. To complement that bullish price action, in 2021 shares of this crypto have put together a well-supported test of the stock\u2019s prior high.\n\nBTBT has pulled back near its 50% retracement level within a smaller corrective \u2018V-shaped\u2019 base. And coupled with a favorable bullish stochastics crossover, this crypto looks ready for buying into.\n\nFavored Strategy: May $25/$40 Bull Call Spread\n\n Source: Charts by TradingView\n\nRiot Blockchain is the next of our crypto stocks to buy. RIOT was one of the digital currency market\u2019s more notorious listed stocks during the asset group\u2019s 2017 \u2013 2018 run-up and subsequent crash. And like BTBT, this diversified blockchain play seemingly came out of nowhere, pivoting and changing its corporate name. It was suspect to say the least. Today however, it\u2019s time to let bygones be bygones.\n-  8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double \n\nTechnically, this crypto stock has just taken out its own bubble high. Even a minor correction could cause RIOT stock investors to blink or more aptly, barf, given the stock\u2019s underlying volatility. As much, playing for continued momentum while maintaining ironclad downside risk is the way to position.\n\nFavored Strategy: March $55/$65 Bull Call Spread\n\n Source: Charts by TradingView\n\nCanaan is the last of our crypto stocks to buy. China-based CAN is the picks-and-shovels play of today\u2019s stocks. The outfit manufacturers equipment used to mine Bitcoin. Canaan is also involved in the development of blockchain technology and, teasingly, the booming artificial intelligence and data center markets.\n\nTechnically, CAN is gunning for a breakout to all-time-highs as shares muscle their way toward the high of a pattern lifetime cup-shaped base. With the stock jumping past the 76% retracement level and weekly stochastics signaling a bullish crossover in neutral territory, a bit of strategic exposure to this crypto looks ripe today.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong? Let\u2019s not find out. At the same time, investors might consider using CAN\u2019s less desirable price volatility to their advantage by hedging a purchase of this crypto stock with a defined risk and highly flexible collar strategy.\n\nFavored Strategy: April $10/$20 Collar\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Tyler holds, directly or indirectly, positions in listed Bitcoin and Ethereum stocks (GBTC, ETHE and ETCG), but no other securities mentioned in this article.\n\nChris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

The cryptocurrency had come close to breaking through the historic level in the early hours of the morning but pulled back. Bitcoin was trading at $50,311.63 at 12.38pm in London.\n\nThe new high extends a bull run for bitcoin that began last October. The world's biggest cryptocurrency has risen over 350% since then.\n\nThe rally has coincided with increased institutional adoption. PayPal (PYPL) said last year it would allow customers to handle the token through its platform and Mastercard (MA) followed suite last week. BNY Mellon, America's oldest bank, said it too would handle bitcoin on behalf of clients, paving the way for more money to flow into the market.\n\nInstitutions have already been putting money into the cryptocurrency. Square (SQ) invested $50m into the cryptocurrency in October and wealth manager Ruffer put some of its \u00a321bn ($29bn) in assets into bitcoin last November. The biggest jolt came when Tesla (TSLA) announced at the start of this month that it had invested $1.5bn into the cryptocurrency.\n\n\"Bitcoin\u2019s ascent from $40k to $50k took 6 weeks, a relative snail\u2019s pace given its move from $20k to $40k happened in 3 weeks,\" said Antoni Trenchev, chief executive of cryptocurrency company Nexo.\n\nHe said the next big price milestone would be $100,000.\n\nWatch: What is bitcoin?\n\n\"Growing corporate support for the crypto makes this a very different market to what it was in 2017,\" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. \"Money printing and dollar debasement is also a factor.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"A decent amount of bitcoin supply is under institutional clients and US corporates' control.

If only we could act upon it. As a way of looking into this ongoing mania of mini-manias, I\u2019ve turned my attention to the latest boom, SPACs, once a quirky, backwater of a security, now all the rage.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Kap, who has a SPAC.\n\nThat being former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, Colin Kaepernick\u2014famous for taking a knee during the national anthem\u2014who has co-founded Mission Advancement Corp, a SPAC, (the word rhymes with \u2018clack\u2019) or special purpose acquisition corporation, also known as a blank check company.\n\nKaepernick\u2019s SPAC will look to invest in companies with a social justice mission. Oscar-nominated filmmaker Ava DuVernay and Silicon Valley VC Ben Horowitz are on its board of advisors. Private equity executive Jahm Najafi, part owner of the NBA\u2019s Phoenix Suns, is the company CEO.\n\nNot surprisingly there\u2019s some eye rolling. \u201cColin Kaepernick becomes latest athlete to join Wall Street\u2019s SPAC craze\u201d read the New York Post headline (and indeed Shaquille O'Neal and Alex Rodriguez also have SPACs.) And then there\u2019s Fox Business which framed it this way: \u201cColin Kaepernick plans to raise $250M for social justice SPAC: The board of directors is completely made up of Black, Indigenous and people of color and represented by a female majority.\u201d (As you might imagine, the comments are toxic.)\n\nPolitics aside, will Kaepernick\u2019s SPAC make any sense? Will it make any money? Kaepernick does have business experience working with Nike, Medium, Apple and others, and he\u2019s not the CEO anyway. But the truth is, and by definition, we have no idea, because as a new SPAC, Mission hasn\u2019t invested in anything yet. So who knows.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about SPACs. The more you dig into them, the more you realize they\u2019re opaque and complicated. They\u2019re also red hot. And that\u2019s not necessarily a great combination.\n\nThe growth has been wack. In 2019, according to SPACInsider, 59 SPACs worth $13 billion were created. Last year there were 248 worth $83 billion. And already, just six weeks into this year, there are 135 SPACs which have raised $40 billion. Many more are on tap.\n\nWe\u2019ll get back to what that means in the big picture, but first let\u2019s journey deeper into the nitty-gritty of SPACs.\n\nHere\u2019s some more basic concepts:\n\n-A SPAC is a shell company formed to go public for the purpose of acquiring an existing company typically within two years. It\u2019s really a way for a company to go public without doing an IPO, (more on that later.)\n\n-Sometimes SPAC sponsors have a target in mind, sometimes they don\u2019t.\n\n-Typically hedge funds and traders bought SPACs to arbitrage prices of SPAC securities (common stock, warrants and loans\u2014trust me it\u2019s complicated.) But now plain-vanilla investors, both professional and retail, are snapping up SPAC shares.\n\n-SPAC shares are usually issued at $10 and used to trade around that price until a deal is announced, but during this frenzy they have been spiking on rumors. (More on that later too.)\n\nEssentially SPACs allow sponsors to make big money\u2014for a nominal investment they get a 20% cut of the deal\u2014and for companies to go public. DraftKings (DKNG), Virgin Galactic (SPCE) and Nikola (NKLA) all went public through a SPAC last year. The success of DraftKings in particular served as a clarion call. In fact the volume of new SPACs is now outpacing traditional IPOs, according to this excellent graphic made by The Wall Street Journal. \n\nAs for you, Mr. and Ms. Investor, you are just along for the ride.\n\nSPACs have been around since at least 1993, according to this great Bloomberg explainer in the Seattle Times, so why are they hot again now?\n\nMuch of it has to do with the one-off year that was 2020. \u201cThere were lots of high growth companies needing capital and the traditional IPO process, which takes twice as long anyway, is far riskier in a pandemic and an election year,\u201d says Kristi Marvin of SPACInisder. She also notes that with a SPAC a company can shill itself by predicting forward earnings, which it couldn\u2019t do in an IPO. \u201cPlus, as a huge bonus,\u201d she says, \u201cyou get to go public with a high profile, seasoned executive, like David Cote, who immediately brings a ton of value to your company.\u201d\n\nAh Dave Cote. Remember him? Former CEO of Honeywell (HON), who had a great run there. As it turns out, Cote may be partly responsible for the SPAC surge. Here\u2019s that story: Cote stepped down as CEO of HON in March 2017 and began to poke around. \u201cYes, I wrote a book, but I didn\u2019t want to do what other ex-CEOs did, I wanted to do something different,\u201d Cote tells me.\n\n\u201cA friend of mine who I respect suggested doing a SPAC, so I took a long hard look. Over the course of a year, I would say 80% to 90% of the people I spoke with told me not to do one. That it would hurt my reputation. And so I was careful. I didn\u2019t want an asterisk next to my name: \u2018Was CEO of Honeywell and also had this lame-ass SPAC.\u2019 But finally I decided there was something there.\u201d\n\nAnd so Cote teamed up with John Waldron at Goldman Sachs, who was also exploring the idea of getting into SPACs. They took the plunge in September 2018, forming GS Acquisition Holdings Corp., with Cote as executive chairman. A little over a year later, their SPAC bought control of Vertiv, a Columbus Ohio-based provider of equipment and services for data centers, from Platinum Equity, a private equity firm run by the billionaire owner of the Detroit Pistons, Tom Gores. The stock [VRT] which dipped down to $5 in the darkness of last March, is now trading at $21.\n\n\u201cWhen we announced the deal in December of 2019, we were flooded with calls,\u201d says Cote. \u201cI joked with John [Waldron] that we kicked this whole thing off and no one remembers us.\u201d\n\nWhich might be understandable given all the bold-faced names I\u2019ve already mentioned in SPACs, along with others I haven\u2019t like Chamath Palihapitiya, (him again), Bill Ackman, Billy Beane, Kevin Systrom, Peter Guber, Ciara, Paul Ryan, Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist Richard Thaler, Gary Cohn, Jay Z, Dan Och, 23andMe, Softbank, SoFi, former Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, Telco billionaire Crag McCaw, Elliot Management, and KKR.\n\nAlso, Adam Lashinksy of Business Insider notes that \u201ca SPAC called Forest Road Acquisition associated with the ex-Disney execs Kevin Mayer [also ex-TikTok] and Thomas Skaggs is buying the well-regarded fitness company Beachbody...Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li and Kristina Salen, the chief financial officer of World Wrestling Entertainment, are on the team that's advising the SPAC started by the entrepreneurs Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus.\u201d\n\nAnd there are hundreds of lesser known players too.\n\nAndrew Ross Sorkin pretty much summed it up with the latest Wall Street zinger in his recent column \u201cI know more people who have a SPAC than have Covid.\u201d (Ba rump-bump.)\n\nTo be clear, celebs in a SPAC aren\u2019t necessarily a red flag (they\u2019re there for deal flow after all), as long as they\u2019re matched up with a legit team. In SPACs, since there is no investment yet, the team is the thing.\n\nNaturally there\u2019s a subreddit for SPACs, (\u201cLet\u2019s Talk About SPACs, Baby\u201d), which is, well, just what you\u2019d imagine it to be.\n\nAnd naturally there are SPAC ETFs too. \u201cThis is the first time you\u2019re able to access private equity-like investments,\u201d says Paul Dellaquila, president of Defiance ETFs, which launched the first SPAC-only ETF (SPAK) last October. \u201cEven the traditional IPO process is very closed off. You and I are not going to get a Snowflake at $120 like Warren Buffett; we come in later. That\u2019s most retail investors' experiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre SPACs right for everybody?\u201d asks Dellaquila. \u201cNo. If you\u2019re 75 years old living on a fixed income trying to get 3% or 4% per year to sustain yourself, it\u2019s not for you. Are SPACs right for the right investor? Absolutely. Young professionals looking for higher returns; it could be right for you. It is a leap of faith, and that\u2019s why potential gains are big.\u201d\n\nBut the leap might be getting bigger.\n\nWith money flooding into SPACs looking for companies to buy and ordinary investors driving up stock prices, risks are rising.\n\n\u201cIn some cases there\u2019s 100% speculation,\u201d says Kristi Marvin. \u201cThe one that worries me the most right now is Churchill Capital [founded and run by veteran banker Michael Klein] About a month ago, it came out as a rumor that Churchill was in negotiations with Lucid Motors, an EV company, which retail investors love. And so they got all excited and pushed the stock into the $30s. Now, it's a month later, still no deal. That's crazy. It's a big question mark to me if this deal even happens. If there's no deal or Lucid is going to go public via direct listing or traditional IPO, or even with another SPAC, investors are all gonna be running through the door.\u201d\n\nMichael Klausner, a Stanford Law School professor who co-authored a study last November entitled \u201cA Sober Look at SPACs,\u201d has an even, well, more sober view: \u201cI think SPACs are fundamentally not a good structure by which to take a company public, therefore I think the spike in SPACs is not a good thing,\u201d he says. Klausner cites the 20% cut taken by sponsors as just one reason. \u201cMoreover, the glut of SPACs that will be competing for targets is not a good thing. So, I guess my conclusion is the spike in SPACs is doubly not a good thing.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal did a piece in November calling into question the performance of SPACs: \u201cSPACs have a poor record of delivering returns. Of 107 that have gone public since 2015 and executed deals, the average return on their common stock has been a loss of 1.4%, according to Renaissance Capital, a research and investment-management firm. During the same period, the average return of companies that went public via IPOs was 49%, the firm says.\u201d\n\nSo you might ask, where are the regulators, the SEC in particular, in all this? Former SEC commish Jay Clayton, a regulation-light kinda guy, noted that SPACs might have issues with transparency.\n\nDitto for former SEC Commissioner Harvey Pitt who spoke with Yahoo Finance\u2019s Adam Shapiro and Seana Smith this week: \u201cI think there are questions about SPACs and their effect on the market,\u201d Pitt said. \u201cThere are also questions about the disclosures that are made and the uses for which the funds raised are put. But in general, raising funds to acquire other companies is itself a very accepted course of conduct. And it's one that's been around for a long time, although not quite in the context we're now seeing it.\u201d Some speculate that Gary Gensler, nominated to succeed Clayton, might take a more active position when it comes to SPACs, but that\u2019s unknown for now.\n\nUnderstand though that the SEC may not be as interventionist as some would like. \u201cThe SEC\u2019s regulatory mandate is as a disclosure regulator rather than a merit regulator,\u201d says Michael Piwowar, who served as a commissioner and acting chairman during his tenure at the SEC from 2013 to 2018. He now works as executive director of the Milken Institute Center for Financial Markets.\n\n\u201cThe SEC makes no judgment as to whether it is a good or bad investment,\u201d says Piwowar. \u201cIt often comes down to balancing two parts of the agency\u2019s mission\u2013protecting investors and facilitating capital formation. To gauge Gary Gensler, look to his comments during his upcoming nomination hearing and public statements early in his term.\u201d\n\nBut if the regulators did decide to act, would they be able to act fast enough? \u201cNo matter what the policy makers do, they\u2019re closing the barn doors after everybody has left,\u201d says Peter Atwater, founder of research firm Financial Insyghts. \u201cThey throw water on a fire that was already going out.\u201d\n\nTo Atwater\u2019s mind, the collapse of SPAC mania is a \u201cwhen\u201d not \u201cif\u201d proposition. \u201cThe data would suggest it\u2019s very much a very late-cycle phenomenon. I joke that the bar charts of it run the risk of looking like a middle finger by the time they\u2019re done: Nothing, nothing, a little bit of build up, and an enormous spike. Those historically get followed by collapse. Insatiable demand is always inevitably followed by absolutely nonexistent demand. The crowd goes from wanting too much to never having it again.\u201d\n\nFor now it\u2019s still frothy. \u201cI was sitting in the locker room of my golf club in Florida the other day,\u201d says a Wall Street big shot. \u201cAnd some guy yells over at me, \u2018hey buddy, you got a company I can buy for my SPAC?\u2019\u201d\n\nAs for Kristi Marvin, she\u2019s had to cut back the newsletter she puts out from once a week to once every two weeks. Why? \u201cEverybody's burned out,\u201d she says. \u201cThe lawyers, myself, the bankers, everybody's exhausted. It's so insane. When I first started the website I was covering maybe 40 SPACs and as of today, I'm covering over 500. It does make me a little nervous. We\u2019re starting to see some deals where you're kind of like, should this team be going public?\u201d\n\nWe always talk about what happens when these manias end. But it\u2019s like if you\u2019re in the trenches? \u201cI had a little bit of PTSD,\u201d says Martin who worked as a SPAC banker a while back. \u201cWe priced 66 deals in 2007 and 2009 there was one. I became an expert in nothing, literally overnight.\u201d\n\nAtwater notes too that most things of interest to SPAC investors are futuristic. \u201cIt\u2019s EVs, space, fintech, cutting edge something that is perceived to have an enormous future to it and that is unlimited in its potential. And then you pair that with an investment vehicle that is a blank check, which itself is a very high-confidence mindset. The behavioral parallels we\u2019re seeing in SPACs we saw on a much more narrow basis with GameStop two weeks ago. And the fact that these have overlapped is significant to me as well. It speaks to this climactic sense of frenzy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to think we all know where this is headed but there is nothing anyone can do to stop it.\n\nThis article was featured in a Saturday edition of the Morning Brief on February 13, 2021.

U.S. stocks tracked gains in European equities, after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"hopeful\" the country's stringent lockdown restrictions could be eased in the coming weeks as the vaccine rollout continues and new daily infections fall further.\n\nOther risk assets also performed strongly. Bitcoin prices (BTC-USD) spiked to a fresh record high of more than $50,000, extending a meteoric rally after the cryptocurrency traded around $35,000 just a month ago. U.S. crude oil (CL=F) jumped above $60 per barrel and reached the highest level since January 2020. And the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declined further on Tuesday, after settling below 20 for the first time since February 2020 on Friday.\n\nOver the past couple weeks, U.S. investors have considered prospects for additional fiscal stimulus alongside much better-than-expected fourth-quarter corporate earnings results across the board. Corporate earnings are on track to grow by about 2.9%, which would mark the first year-over-year increase in profits since the final quarter of 2019, according to FactSet. And on the fiscal stimulus front, lawmakers are racing to get another stimulus package done before a mid-March lapse in federal unemployment benefits occurs after the last round of virus relief. \n\n\"Earnings season has provided proof of an earlier than expected rebound in corporate performance, and with fresh stimulus money likely to wing its way to the American population there is reason to expect further quarterly growth,\" Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, said in an email. \"Despite all the naysayers, global stock markets, led by the U.S., continue to make headway, and seem well-set to continue doing so.\"\n\nSome strategists have also taken the contrarian view that the overwhelmingly positive catalysts as of late may be reason itself to take heed.\n\n\"[The] only reason to be bearish is\u2026there is no reason to be bearish,\u201d Michael Harnett, Bank of America Securities chief investment strategist, wrote in the firm's latest global fund managers' survey. \n\nThe survey, which involved polling 225 investors with $645 billion in assets under management between Feb. 5 to 11, showed that allocations to stocks and commodities had reached the highest levels since 2011, while cash levels were at an eight-year low. All things considered, Bank of America's proprietary \"bull and bear indicator\" tracking market sentiment rose to 7.7, closing in on the firm's 8.0 \"sell\" signal.\n\n\u2014\n\nHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:02 p.m. ET:\n- S&P 500 (^GSPC): -2.32 (-0.06%) to 3,932.51\n- Dow (^DJI): +63.62 (+0.20%) to 31,522.02\n- Nasdaq (^IXIC): -47.97 (-0.34%) to 14,047.50\n- Crude (CL=F): +$0.69 (+1.16%) to $60.16 a barrel\n- Gold (GC=F): -$27.60 (-1.51%) to $1,795.60 per ounce\n- 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +9.9 bps to yield 1.2990%\n\n\u2014\n\nU.S. crude oil prices extended a February rally to settle above $60 per barrel, the highest since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe commodity prices have surged in recent days as ultra-cold temperatures across much of the U.S. pushed up demand for fuel and raised concerns about production in Texas. This compounded with increasing optimism over fuel demand as vaccine distribution enables more businesses and destinations to reopen later this year.\n\nU.S. West Texas intermediate crude oil prices have risen more than 23% since the start of 2021, and have surged more than 60% since Pfizer and BioNTech first announced positive vaccine efficacy data in early November.\n\n\u2014\n\nHere's where markets were trading shortly Tuesday afternoon:\n- S&P 500 (^GSPC): +1.09 points (+0.03%) to 3,935.92\n- Dow (^DJI): +68.83 points (+0.22%) to 31,529.02\n- Nasdaq (^IXIC): -43.14 points (-0.31%) to 14,052.10\n- Crude (CL=F): +$0.13 (+0.22%) to $59.60 a barrel\n- Gold (GC=F): -$29.20 (-1.6%) to $1,794.00 per ounce\n- 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +8.4 bps to yield 1.284%\n\n\u2014\n\nWith equities continuing to set fresh record highs, the S&P 500 could be due for a correction before ultimately tearing higher, according to at least one Wall Street firm.\n\n\"We still believe the market is ripe for a pullback, but the focus should remain on our core fundamental thesis and the global reflation theme. The Fed is focused on obtaining sustainably higher inflation, money availability remains historic, the economy is just in the beginning of a long-duration recovery, consensus EPS forecasts are still too conservative, and like 2010 any valuation contraction should be a result of a sharp EPS ramp rather than something more onerous,\" Canaccord Genuity analyst Tony Dwyer said in a note Tuesday.\n\n\"The macro backdrop and market action coming off the March 2020 low continues to track the gains coming out of the Great Financial Crisis, which means corrections may be coming followed by even more gains,\" he added. \"Despite the prospect of a potential pullback, our investment themes remain in place given historic excess liquidity fueling a synchronized global recovery.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nHere's where markets were trading shortly after the opening bell Tuesday morning:\n- S&P 500 (^GSPC): +10.75 points (+0.27%) to 3,941.75\n- Dow (^DJI): +108.00 points (+0.34%) to 31,505.00\n- Nasdaq (^IXIC): +40.75 points (+0.3%) to 13,845.5\n- Crude (CL=F): +$0.47 (+0.79%) to $59.94 a barrel\n- Gold (GC=F): -$28.60 (-1.57%) to $1,794.60 per ounce\n- 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +6.2 bps to yield 1.265%\n\n\u2014\n\nNewly public data software company Palantir (PLTR) unexpectedly posted a loss in the final three months of 2020, surprising investors who had been looking for the company to end a streak of losses as more customers joined the platform during the pandemic. Palantir landed new contracts in the fourth quarter with companies including PG&E, BP and the U.S. Air Force.\n\nThe company's operating loss totaled $156.7 million in the three months ending in December. This was wider than the operating loss of $147.5 million the company posted in the same quarter last year. For the full year, operating losses were $1.12 billion versus $576 million in 2019. However, excluding stock based compensation and some other charges, Palantir swung to a profit of $189.9 million for the full year.\n\nFourth-quarter revenue grew 40% to $322 million, though this was slower than the company's overall sales growth rate of 47% for the full year. For the first quarter, Palantir said it expects revenue growth of 45%.\n\n\u2014\n\nHere\u2019s where markets were trading ahead of the opening bell:\n- S&P 500 futures (ES=F): 3,951.5, up 20.5 points or 0.52%\n- Dow futures (YM=F): 31,589.00, up 192 points or 0.61%\n- Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): 13,876.00, up 71.25 points or 0.52%\n- Crude (CL=F): +$0.32 (+0.54%) to $59.79 a barrel\n- Gold (GC=F): -$4.20 (-0.23%) to $1,819.00 per ounce\n- 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +6.2 bps to yield 1.262%\n\n\u2014\n\nEmily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "Canadian Dollar Forecast: Loonie Fights to Take Flight - Setups for CAD/JPY, USD/CAD", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "20 hours ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "For many weeks, Canada trailed many of its G10 counterparts in terms of vaccination rates. But improvements in distribution in recent weeks has seen the Canadian distribution program pick up its pace, and its now possible that market participants are no longer considering this an impediment, or at least a relative burden (compared to vaccination rates in the UK or US, for example). When we first examined how vaccines were weighing down the Loonie, Canada\u2019s vaccination rate was 2.6 per 100 people; now it stands at 3.6 per 100 people. Not great, and still not the pace seen in the UK or US, but it\u2019s an improvement.\n\nAlongside the vaccination pace starting to improve, a key pillar of the Canadian economy has been bolstered: energy markets have seen prices surge higher in recent days (in part, thanks to the Texas energy disaster). Energy accounts for approximately 11% of Canadian GDP, so there has been the typical cross-asset flow of funds into the Canadian Dollar as a proxy for rising oil prices. \n\nAs the polar vortex contracts, upside momentum in energy markets may be curtailed, meaning that the Loonie may have a bit of a fight on its hands as it attempts bullish breakout attempts vis-\u00e0-vis CAD/JPY and USD/CAD rates.\n\nFor weeks it was noted that \u201cCAD/JPY rates have tested parallel channel resistance in the 81.58/91 area, but have struggled to make headway, a common occurrence since June 2020. But the more times resistance (or support) is tested, the more likely it is to break as supply on the other side of the trade is exhausted. As trading is a function of both price and time, by simply maintaining their elevation, CAD/JPY rates are now above the descending trendline from the January 2018, October 2018, and February 2020 highs, and holding right at the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement of the 2020 high/low range at 82.16\u2026While more patience may still be required, CAD/JPY bulls may be on high alert for a bullish breakout attempt.\u201d\n\nThis patience has paid off, with CAD/JPY rates breaking above the 81.58/91 area, currently trading at 83.65 at the time this report was written. CAD/JPY rates are above their daily 5-, 8-, 13-, and 21-EMA envelope, which is in bullish sequential order. Daily MACD is rising while above its signal line, while daily Slow Stochastics are holding overbought territory. A break of the yearly high at 83.75 would signal bullish continuation.\n\nIn the most recent Canadian Dollar forecast update, it was noted that \u201cUSD/CAD rates have run into downtrend from the March and October 2020 highs, which has served as resistance on four such attempts over the past two weeks.\u201d The pair was never able to break this downtrend, and instead, a reconstituted chart suggests that a descending triangle has been forming dating back to early-December 2020, with support defined by the 2021 yearly low at 1.2589. \n\nUSD/CAD rates are seeing bearish momentum gather pace. USD/CAD rates are below their daily 5-, 8-, 13-, and 21-EMA envelope, which is now in bearish sequential order. Daily MACD is declining and is now below its signal line, while daily Slow Stochastics are falling back into oversold territory. A test of the yearly low appears highly likely.\n\nUSD/CAD: Retail trader data shows 68.48% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.17 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.74% lower than yesterday and 11.55% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 21.44% lower than yesterday and 8.50% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests USD/CAD prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed USD/CAD trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "The Chart of the Week:", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/8dxTGWaTbrzsbY4FQOuGEw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/8e5bf91621412eb185fce0e72cb94889", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Following on from last week's analysis,\u00a0CAD/JPY Price Analysis: Bulls stepping in at a discount within long-term bullish trajectory, the cross is indeed headed in a northerly trajectory, albeit correcting.\n\nHowever, it is\u00a0expected to continue towards a measured target of 82.9150.\n\nThe cross spiked from within 4-hour demand on Thursday to print a higher high in resistance which has now seen the cross buckle to support in the 82.61 territories.\n\nThe following is a top-down analysis that illustrates a bullish bias still from a longer-term perspective.\n\nThe daily chart was showing prospects of a bullish fill of the wick left by the strong bid in the cross that crystalised at a 38.2% Fibonacci of the bullish impulse.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFrom a 4-hour perspective, the set-up was based on the correction's prospective floor at the support structure.

Normal is in the vicinity of 100 to 200 pips maximum because NZD/USD and NZD/JPY are the exact same currency pairs much the same as AUD/USD and AUD/JPY.\n\nThe divide grows wider at 800 pips from GBP/USD 1.3600\u2019s to GBP/JPY at 147.00\u2019s and 700 pips from EUR/USD 1.2000\u2019s to 127.00\u2019s for EUR/JPY and normal is 100 to 200 because GBP/USD and GBP/JPY are the exact same currency pairs much the same as EUR/USD and EUR/JPY.\n\nUSD pairs EUR/NZD at 1.6700\u2019s trades 2500 pips to GBP/NZD 1.9200\u2019s. Normal trades around 1600 to 1800 pips and 700 pips off kilter.\n\nThe EUR/USD and USD/JPY relationship is distinguished by the massive and extreme divide between and among currency pair prices, particularly USD and overall cross pairs as the primary driver to current prices.\n\nToday\u2019s trade is presented as a two trade option by matching significant day trade support, resistance and levels. Short the highs and long the lows.\n\nUSD/JPY highs Vs EUR/USD Lows.\n\nUSD/JPY up target 106.43 vs EUR/USD 1.1985 lows.\n\nUSD/JPY 106.36 Vs EUR/USD 1.1998.\n\nUSD/JPY 106.29 V EUR/USD 1.2011\n\nUSD/JPY 106.16 Vs EUR/USD 1.2015\n\nUSD/JPY 106.09 Vs EUR/USD 1.2023\n\nUSD/JPY 106.03 Vs EUR/USD 1.2028.\n\nUSD/JPY 105.96 Vs EUR/USD 1.2034.\n\nEUR/USD Highs Vs USD/JPY lows\n\nEUR/USD 1.2107 Vs USD/JPY 105.37\n\nEUR/USD 1.2099 Vs USD/JPY 105.44\n\nEUR/USD 1.2091 Vs USD/JPY 105.51\n\nEUR/USD 1.2076 Vs USD/JPY 105.58\n\nEUR/USD 1.2068 Vs USD/JPY 105.63\n\nEUR/USD 1.2061 Vs USD/JPY 105.71\n\nEUR/USD 1.2053 Vs USD/JPY 105.79\n\nEUR/USD 1.2049 Vs USD/JPY 105.87.\n\nEUR/USD is a complete opposite pair to USD/JPY however prices never match pip for pip as the relationship runs 7.62 pips for EUR/USD Vs 6.62 for USD/JPY.As a side note all market prices especially Stock Indices are factored the exact same as a currency price. The difference is in the name and number yet its all the same.\n\nNot many pips trade anymore as the old days of trading therefore pips and profits are maximized by multiple longs and shorts per currency pair. All information is known in advance of the trade therefore no stops, charts and whatever is needed nor applied.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  EUR/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Test Of Support At 1.2040 \n-  AUD/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Australian Dollar Moves Higher Against U.S. Dollar \n-  3 Silver Stocks with a Shiny Outlook \n-  GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Motor Higher \n-  EUR/USD Mid-Session Technical Analysis for February 18, 2021 \n-  GBP/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Support At 1.3835 In Sight \n"}, {"headline": "Inflation Fears Weigh More On Equities | Investing.com", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "23 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y JFD Team", "body": "USD performance G10 performance\nUSD performance G10 performance\nUSD performance G10 performance\nMajor global stock indices performance\nMajor global stock indices performance\nMajor global stock indices performance\nEUR Stoxx 50 4-hour chart technical analysis\nEUR Stoxx 50 4-hour chart technical analysis\nEUR Stoxx 50 4-hour chart technical analysis\nEUR/USD 4-hour chart technical analysis\nEUR/USD 4-hour chart technical analysis\nEUR/USD 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\n"}, {"headline": "Euro Forecast: Why Bulls Like EUR/JPY More Than EUR/USD", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/hD.CP8K5AknbE3Yvtv_VBA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/2b1579959f6ef2083a7f7d9790ce37ea", "auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "The world of FX is based on relativity, and relatively speaking, the EU is trailing other developed economies with its vaccination rates, and the EU is growing less robustly than other regions. By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "Canadian Dollar Forecast: USD/CAD Defending Yearly Lows- Key Support", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "Michael Boutros", "body": "The Canadian Dollar fractionally lower against the US Dollar with USD/CAD defending the yearly range-lows into the open of the week. The rebound threatens the broader bearish stance and we continue to look for inflection off this zone to offer guidance in the days ahead on whether this is a bear market recovery or a larger reversal. These are the updated targets and invalidation levels that matter on the USD/CAD weekly technical price. Review my latest Strategy Webinar for an in-depth breakdown of this Loonie technical setup and more.\n\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Technical Strategist; USD/CAD on Tradingview\n\nNotes: In last month\u2019s Canadian Dollar Weekly Price Outlook we noted that the, \u201cUSD/CAD breakdown may be losing steam here as price responds to confluence downtrend support. From a trading standpoint, the threat for a larger recovery remains while above 1.2579.\u201d Price registered a low at 1.2610 today before reversing sharply higher with price poised to mark an outside-day reversal in early US trade.\n\nLoonie turned just ahead of the January lows in USD/CAD and keeps the yearly range in focus while above key confluence support at the 2018 yearly open / 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of 2017 advance at 1.2579-1.2619. Initial weekly resistance eyed at the low-week close at 1.2727 with a breach / weekly close above monthly open resistance at 1.2785 needed to mark a larger reversal. Key resistance / bearish invalidation steady at t the 2020 yearly open at 1.2975. A break lower from here would risk accelerated losses for the US Dollar with such a scenario exposing subsequent support objectives at the 2018 low-week close at 1.2421 and the 88.6% retracement at 1.2358.\n\nBottom line: The Canadian Dollar is consolidating within the yearly opening-range just above key technical support at 1.2579-1.2619. From a trading standpoint, a good zone for possible price inflection with the broader short-bias vulnerable while above. Be on the lookout for downside exhaustion head of this threshold with a breach / close above the monthly open at 1.2785 needed to suggest a more significant low is in place.

EUR/USD is categorized in the class of a risk asset and non USD currency.\n\nEUR/USD\u2019s early break to its 5 year average set remainder 27 currencies on a course of deep perspective as non USD currency pairs had to not only match EUR/USD\u2019s break to significant averages but the 1000 pip rise in GBP/USD, 700 for AUD/USD and other non USD currency pairs traded weekly from overbought to overbought and a non normal price circumstance. EUR/USD\u2019s break threw normal price markets deeply off course since August 2020.\n\nNon USD currency pairs such as DXY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY only option since August 2020 was to concur with EUR/USD and non USD rises by trading deeply oversold week to week and to break 5 and 10 year averages.\n\nDXY for example just broke above its 10 year average at 89.95 and contains a long way to travel to the 5 year average at 95.00\u2019s.\n\nToday, markets are ready to slowly embark on a deep 3 and 500 pip correction as currency prices traded to lowest and highest depths of oversold and overbought. This will take time as highlighted in the January 3rd post to long term forecasts because currency prices remain in 3 and 400 pip trading ranges and contained within vital breaks to 5 and 10 year averages. No better time than the present to position for the impending correction.\n\nA correction means a break of 5 and 10 year averages to only trade in new 3 and 400 pip trade ranges as markets and all financial instruments range far more than trend. Consider EUR/USD\u2019s 1000 pip rise from 1.1300 to 1.2300 by 166 pips per month for 6 months.

By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "DXY vs S&P's vs Gold", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zsN8_u4ssqAGXoQvoV4ofA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/76825f5773348b586328b2db07473959", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "To respectfully indulge words from the last post for context:\n\nOverall, EUR/USD was the first currency in August 2020 to break above its 5 year average at 1.1300\u2019s then the 10 year average in December 2020 at 1.2100\u2019s.

EUR/USD\u2019s break threw normal price markets deeply off course since August 2020.\n\nNon USD currency pairs such as DXY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY only option since August 2020 was to concur with EUR/USD and non USD rises by trading deeply oversold week to week and to break 5 and 10 year averages.\n\nEUR/USD and non USD currency pairs as risk assets followed risk asset counterparts in stock markets higher to current richter scale overbought levels. The S&P's at 3900.00's trade at\u00a0 extreme overbought levels. The DAX achieved all time highs. Stock market longs are virtually impossible until a significant correction occurs.\n\nDXY\n\nDXY for example just broke above its 10 year monthly average at 89.95 and contains a long way to travel to the 5 year average at 95.00\u2019s. A currency pair to trade at a 10 year monthly average is not only a low, low price but extraordinary and highlights the magnitude to the\u00a0 rises and falls since last August.\n\nNext averages above to break are located at 91.43, 92.78 then 94.39 and 94.16. DXY from monthly averages 1 to 7 years faces stiff resistance from 94.00's to 95.00's. A break through this brick wall then DXY will travel easily to 97.00's and 99.00's.\n\nDXY below 89.95 targets 86.43, 84.32 and 81.83 at extreme oversold.\n\nTargets for DXY above 89.95 are located at 90.86, above 91.43 then 92.15,\u00a0 92.47 and 92.66. Above 92.78 targets 92.87 and 92.89.\n\nDXY from current ranges from 89.95 to 92.78 trade at its widest ranges. As DXY travels higher then ranges severely compress. The opposite is true for EUR/USD as the higher it trades then ranges open much wider.\n\nDespite a low price and trade below monthly 5 year averages, DXY is mid range to oversold/ overbought.\n\nS&P's\n\nDXY viewed from the S&P's informs trade location miles above the 5 year monthly average at 2722.43 and at overbought to extremes. Overbought S&P's reveals a healthy correction is on the way, DXY higher and EUR/USD as well as non USD currency pairs to follow much lower.\n\nThe S&P's are held by immediate averages at 3257.68, 3119.54 and 2989.17. A correction targets 3598.53, 3416.84 and 3300.20. A 400 point correction to the S&P's assumes DXY travels 300 ish pips higher and\u00a0 breaks above 92.78 to trade between 92.78 to 94.39.\n\nS&P averages from 3257.68 travels every 100 points to 2200.00's at the 10 year monthly average. Current S&P's ranges are fairly suppressed however as S&P's drop then ranges expand as the downside gains progresses.\n\nGold\n\nGold trades above its 5 year monthly average at 1461.20 and trades misaligned to the S&P's. Gold and the DXY are the same assets and should trade below 5 year monthly averages while the S&P's trade above.\n\nGold's drop is held by 1815.65 and below targets 1642.17 and 1543.98. Gold is deeply overbought from a medium and long term perspective. Gold is finished above at 1943.62 and short is the only trade available.\u00a0\n\nMoving forward, long USD and DXY is the best option while short Gold and the S&P's although Gold lacks any real range capability. Gold viewed from 150 to 200 points is a viable option as it fails to contain any big price moves.\n"}, {"headline": "FOREX-Dollar in doldrums as recovery optimism thrives", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/YiP2NsdkZpsIB3Of3bcyGw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/d1c8ccb10d2d40cf34f4f4a786df8545", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "Dollar needs retail sales comeback", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/XCEr4u3s.uYpzciaTbWPgQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/edfcec2f2b9387effb44447d0e569af5", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Currencies Reverse\u00a0Despite New Highs for Stocks\n\nU.S. traders came back from their long weekend on Tuesday ready for a busy trading week. \u00a0They drove stocks to fresh record highs which should have coincided with a weaker\u00a0U.S. dollar (#USD).\u00a0However stronger than expected manufacturing activity in the New York region boosted risk appetite.\u00a0Looking ahead sustainability of the dollar (#USD) and equity market (#DOW) rally hinges on a retail recovery.\u00a0\n\nThe end of 2020 was particularly tough for retailers as consumer spending dropped three months in a row.\u00a0Economists are looking for tomorrow\u2019s\u00a0retail sales report to show a rebound in January but with wage and job growth slowing, this forecast may be tough to meet.\u00a0If consumer spending falls for four straight months, vaccine optimism may not be enough prevent a correction in stocks.

The Canadian dollar (#CAD) fell the most on the back of lower prices and a stronger U.S. dollar.\u00a0Like the U.K., inflation data is scheduled for release tomorrow.\u00a0The price component of IVEY PMI surged signaling stronger price pressures in Canada.\u00a0The Australian dollar (#AUD) was hit by RBA minutes which showed the central bank looking to maintain significant monetary support for some time. \u00a0A 3 day lockdown and weaker New Zealand service sector activity drove\u00a0#NZD/USD\u00a0lower.\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "FOREX-Dollar heavy as clues sought on pace of U.S. recovery;

Ask them about cryptocurrency predictions for 2021. As Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), XRP (CCC:XRP-USD) and others have rocketed in value, never before has Wall Street seemed so hesitant about \u201cdigital gold,\u201d a name they use to invoke a margin of safety.\n\nBut as any experienced crypto investor knows, that\u2019s not the way cryptocurrencies work. Instead, it\u2019s a digital popularity contest where winners keep winning and losers bite the dust.\n\nSo, which cryptocurrencies can make you rich in 2021?\n\nTo answer that question, we need to explore the world of altcoins \u2014 up-and-coming coins that you can buy for cheap. That\u2019s because it pays to get in early. For example, $1,000 invested in Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) would be worth $3.3 million today. Meanwhile, $1,000 invested in Bitcoin today might earn \u201cjust\u201d 4-5x upside if you believe JP Morgan\u2019s lofty $146,000 target price.\n\nBut there are also significant risks because cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. Instead, their worth comes from their users. The more users a coin has, the more useful it becomes, and the higher its price goes. But when a coin falls out of favor, there\u2019s nothing to stop it from going to zero. That means investing in cryptocurrency requires strong belief that others will eventually buy it from you for even more.\n\nToday, people invest in crypto for one reason alone: to make money. So far, cryptocurrencies have delivered on that promise. Mom-and-pop investors have profited handsomely as Bitcoin and other currencies have rocketed in value.\n\nBut the risks in 2021 are growing \u2014 at their core, cryptocurrencies only serve to transfer wealth from one party to another. And some new competitors have recently popped up.\n\n\u201cChina has already developed a Central Bank-backed crypto, and in the U.S. it was discussed as part of the C-19 stimulus,\u201d writes Laura Gonzalez, Ph.D., associate professor of Finance at California State University, Long Beach. \u201cThere is ample evidence of speculation as well, and the value of the current cryptos will be affected by the upcoming central-bank backed digital currencies.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unregulated cryptocurrencies will one day compete against state-sponsored ones too.\n\nHere\u2019s the takeaway: if you have an extremely conservative portfolio and need to add \u201crisk-on\u201d assets, choosing a basket of top-rated cryptocurrencies could be right for you. It\u2019s a cheap way to gain massive macroeconomic risk exposure. But don\u2019t get fooled by thinking of crypto as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d If 2021 sees a surprise economic slowdown, no amount of hope will keep crypto afloat.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to take those risks, then you might want to start your search with the top 28 cryptocurrencies you need to know for 2021:\n\nWhile each has enormous potential, some are safer bets than others. As such, I\u2019ve organized the cryptocurrencies based on their overall risk-to-reward potential from most balanced to least. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at the wild world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum is a relative newcomer that has risen up the ranks thanks to its superior technology and its ability to create \u201csmart contracts.\u201d\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $200 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: $102020 Return: 470%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nEther, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is a technologically advanced version of Bitcoin that stands to grow even faster. Rather than hold itself as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d Ethereum runs on a series of contracts. That makes it more like Google Wallet or Apple Pay \u2014 a system that can approve or delay transactions based on real-world events. Online buyers and sellers, for instance, could set up trades that only follow through when the postal service independently verifies the delivery of goods.\n\nEthereum is also blazingly fast compared to Bitcoin: transactions only take 15 seconds to clear, rather than 15 minutes. Although trading costs are still high, its speed makes Ethereum useful for real-time use, rather than only as a store of value. Finally, Ethereum also has widespread adoption, with over 600,000 wallet addresses in use. As developers add services and protocols to make cryptocurrencies more useful, Ethereum looks set to keep winning.\n\nThese qualities have pushed Ethereum to my No. 1 spot in terms of risk-to-reward potential. Despite it having a later start than many other currencies, it has a winning combination of widespread usage, technological superiority and relative safety (compared to smaller coins, at least).\n\nBitcoin is the most widely adopted cryptocurrency. Although it\u2019s not the most technologically advanced, it continues to lead the pack.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $920 billionYear Established: 2009Cost Per Transaction: $152020 Return: 309%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe first successful cryptocurrency continues to lead the pack. With its first-mover advantage, Bitcoin not only won early name recognition. It also became the de-facto cryptocurrency for mainstream investors. Smaller investors can use Square (NYSE:SQ) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) services to buy as little as $1 (or as much as they can \u201chodl\u201d). Meanwhile, institutional investors can use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to transact millions of dollars in futures.\n\nThat makes Bitcoin an essential allocation. The world\u2019s No. 1 coin makes up close to two-thirds of the entire cryptocurrency market, providing liquidity between smaller altcoins. Its size also makes it resistant to 51% attacks, where large cryptocurrency miners attempt to use computing heft to try manipulating the blockchain.\n\nHowever, popular as it may be, Bitcoin has some downsides. As one of the earliest blockchains, Bitcoin\u2019s ledger is large and unwieldy. Transactions can cost $12 to complete and take over 15 minutes to clear. That\u2019s fine for its purpose as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d but it prevents BTC from use as a day-to-day currency. (People paying in Bitcoin will often use third-party services to transact small amounts).\n\nBitcoin is also extremely sensitive to macroeconomic movements \u2014 the currency lost half its value in the most recent U.S. stock market downturn. And if 2021 reveals a weak economic recovery or mutated strain of the novel coronavirus, Bitcoin could easily lose 50-80% of its value. But for those looking to invest in cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the most liquid option. It\u2019s an essential coin to hold, and one that receives top marks for in 2021.\n\nXRP is a centralized cryptocurrency that\u2019s geared toward taking out the high costs of inter-bank transfers.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $24 billionYear Established: 2012Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 16%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIf you could only bet on one cryptocurrency this year, XRP would be it. XRP is the largest currency to have 10x potential for 2021.\n\nXRP is the odd duckling of the cryptocurrency world. Founded by Ripple Labs, XRP is a centralized currency that\u2019s mined, managed and administered by Ripple Labs (instead of a broad-based community). On one hand, that gives the coin the benefits of Visa (NYSE:V) and other centralized payments processors. These include the ability to negotiate with large banks, execute trades quickly and control policies.\n\nOn the other hand, critics are right to question: \u201cWhy use a cryptocurrency in the first place then?\u201d\n\nXRP has also had its share of accounting issues. Specifically, in December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and two executives for selling XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Ripple also controls over half of the XRP supply.\n\nStill, XRP has enormous potential. The currency is used by financial institutions as an alternative to the SWIFT network, giving it a real-world application. And its low price-per-coin makes it a tempting target for punters \u2014 it\u2019s easier to see XRP rising 1,000% to $3.5 than BTC doing the same to $454,000.\n\nA well-placed contender to XRP\u2019s crown, Stellar offers low-cost, cross-border transactions.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $11 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 189%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n2021 is shaping to become Stellar\u2019s year. After lagging Bitcoin in 2020, Stellar surprised analysts and investors alike by rocketing 200% in the first week of January. The coin has continued to outperform expectations since.\n\nMuch of its success comes from XRP\u2019s misfortunes. Much like XRP, Stellar was designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. As regulatory issues mount for rival XRP, Stellar has quickly moved to fill the void. But some of it has also come down to luck. In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowed banks to start using independent node verification networks. The same week, the Ukrainian government announced a partnership with Stellar Development to create a national digital currency.\n\nAll this grants perfect investment conditions for Stellar, a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nCardano is the largest third-generation cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s packed with plenty more upside potential in 2021.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 441%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nADA, which runs on the Cardano network is one of the most technologically exciting cryptocurrencies to date. Its proof-of-stake system means it can operate more efficiently than the standard proof-of-work system. And its use of smart contracts means that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum. In short, it\u2019s a third-generation coin that improves on its predecessors.\n\nADA/Cardano still has plenty of work to do in the year ahead. After all, having a superior technological product means nothing if people won\u2019t adopt it. But three key areas make it a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nFirst, ADA has momentum. The currency took just three years to hit a $10 billion market cap \u2014 one-third the time it took Bitcoin to do the same. Second, it sits at just 30 cents per coin, making it a tempting target for punters to run up. Finally, it has the ability to handle transactions and smart contracts. This makes it a natural enhancement for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nAn internet meme turned cryptocurrency, Dogecoin teaches the world about making money.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $7 billionYear Established: 2013Cost Per Transaction: 3 cents2020 Return: 118%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2013, IBM (NYSE:IBM) software engineer Billy Markus founded Dogecoin as a meme joke. And like most memes, Dogecoin saw its 15 minutes of fame. In 2017, DOGE briefly rocketed 85,000% as the internet found its new amusement; it subsequently lost 98% of its value.\n\nBut in the world of cryptocurrencies and memes alike, second acts DO exist. In December 2020, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sent Dogecoin back up 200% in a week simply by tweeting about it. As 2021 rolls around, this newfound popularity could send the coin up to speculative heights. Dogecoin does have its merits: its faster block time makes it better at processing payments than Bitcoin can. But in an asset class where popularity trounces usability any day of the week, Dogecoin could quickly return 1,000%.\n\nJust make sure you take your profits.\n\nAlong with Cardano/ADA, Polkadot is another promising third-generation cryptocurrency to consider.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 205%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn December, Binance announced a $10 million fund to support projects on Polkadot, a new cryptocurrency. DOT\u2019s price shot up 41% within a week. And more gains could be on the way.\n\nFounded by Gavin Wood, the Chief Technology Officer of the Ethereum Project, its protocol improves on older blockchains. From a technological standpoint, Polkadot\u2019s key difference is its use of parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that can run in parallel. That solves a massive issue for Bitcoin, which has a single, growing blockchain that all miners (and transactors) need to store. Developers have also added scalability, smart contracts and security.\n\nStill, investors need to remember that, in the world of cryptocurrencies, the best technologies aren\u2019t always the winners \u2014 it will take strong marketing (and some luck) to get Polkadot to rival its larger competitors.\n\nNEO \u2014 \u201cthe Chinese Ethereum\u201d \u2014 looks set to shine if the Chinese Communist Party allows it.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $3 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 63%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by NEO\u2019s sleepy looking returns in 2020. NEO (formerly known as Antshares) is one of China\u2019s earliest and largest cryptocurrency ventures. The coin fell hard in 2018 as the Chinese government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. But in 2021, the coin staged a remarkable resurgence as Chinese regulators turned their ire to Ant Group, a payments processor.\n\nWith the Chinese Communist Party now rethinking its stance on cryptocurrencies, NEO has a chance to shine once again.\n\nLender Celsius is a cryptocurrency with the potential to become a bank.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2018Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 3,717%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2018, Celsius Network crowdfunded $20 million to create a cryptocurrency lending platform. Since then, the network has written $6.2 billion in loans and produced $11 million in interest income, making it more like a bank than a currency. And by registering as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Celsius has soared even as other regulatory related currencies like XRP have struggled. In fact, its 2020 return was one of the highest of any other coin.\n\nStill, Celsius has plenty of risk for potential investors. As companies from Bear Stearns to Lehman Brothers found, bad loans can quickly threaten the stability of an entire lending operation. And the Celsius Network has raised red flags in the past, particularly with its unclear collateral requirements. In other words, Celsius could also blow up like a bank if they don\u2019t have the right controls in place.\n\nNevertheless, CEL could still continue to rise. It\u2019s one of the largest pure-play P2P lenders in the crypto space, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in 2021.\n\nWant to have your own blockchain? Nano gives every user their own ledger.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: <$1 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: N/A2020 Return: 54%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nNano is a prime example of playing the cryptocurrency lottery. Having traded sideways in 2020, Nano suddenly jumped 400% in the first week of 2021. Why? Some may point to a December hack on an Italian cryptocurrency exchange. Others might point to Nano\u2019s reasonably superior technology. But in the microcap altcoin world, timing has far more to do with luck.\n\nHowever, now that demand is rising, keep watch. A short-term spike is often how new coins gain popularity. With its ability to assign entire blockchains to individual accounts, Nano looks like an attractive Bitcoin alternative.\n\nChainlink is a cryptocurrency that allows others to run smart contracts.

It\u2019s a formula that sounds good in theory.\n\nFrom an investor standpoint, however, Chainlink\u2019s complexity has worked against it. Making use of the protocol still requires hardcore programming knowledge, and that shrinks its potential audience. What Chainlink needs is a strong sponsor \u2014 a business like Ripple Labs, for example \u2014 to market and implement its smart contracts as required.\n\nIf the currency can find that sponsor, LINK will soar.

Built on JavaScript, one of the most common programming languages, Lisk promised to open application developments to a far wider range of developers.\n\nThe optimism, however, didn\u2019t last. As Lisk\u2019s programming issues began to emerge, the coin\u2019s price began to sink \u2014 certain quirks in its programming language made it relatively inefficient and prone to non-deterministic behavior. By 2017, LSK had shed almost all its value to settle at just 10 cents. And despite a second massive run-up in the 2018 cryptocurrency bubble, the coin has since settled back, dropping off the top-100 coin charts by market cap.\n\nInterest in the coin, however, has refused to completely disappear. Earlier this year, Robinhood added Lisk to its list of tracked cryptocurrencies, sending prices up over 250%. That means, while Lisk might have significant technological issues, renewed interest in the coin could incentivize developers back to the drawing board to improve the coin. If that happens (and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d), Lisk could quickly regain strength and challenge the larger coins once again.\n\nMonero is the No. 1 privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $4 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: 4 cents2020 Return: 244%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMonero has long been a favored coin for its privacy applications.

Yet, the cryptocurrency has had a revival in recent months.

Rather than run every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, the OMG network would use sidechains to group several transactions together before sending them to the main blockchain. These transactions are secured by OMG Network\u2019s coin, OMG.\n\nDespite its relative promise, however, investor interest in the OMG Network has been muted. Like Dai/MakerDAO and other cryptocurrencies that rely on other blockchains, OMG has had trouble raising enough interest to create life of its own. Still, it\u2019s one of the handful of coins Robinhood tracks, making it a potential smaller break-out coin for 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t expect fireworks.

Such futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell Ether at a predetermined price at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace\u00a0contributor Vivian Medithi covered the topic earlier this month and highlighted, \u201cAnalysts expect to see increased institutional investment in ether as a result of the introduction of futures contracts, bolstering the recent bullish run in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s move comes about three years after its December 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures. At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon.

Nevertheless, the currency is still up 1,350% this year with a market value of $8 billion. While many have expressed enthusiasm about the currency, others remain cautious.\n\nAn article by MarketWatch explains that unlike traditional Bitcoin which is limited in supply, Dogecoin has no built-in limit. This means that it can be mined for hundreds or thousands at any given time. Ultimately, the currency value is the result of a mass-market movement that remains untethered.\n\nSo the currency, as it stands, is largely speculative. Billy Markus, the founder of Dogecoin, recently stated the rally is \u201cnot something (he) can comprehend.\u201d He likened the rally to that of stocks like GameStop and AMC (NYSE:AMC) \u2014 both of which have cooled down considerably from their highs. Many researchers have also urged investors to exercise greater caution when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin.\n\nThe rise in the currency\u2019s price can serve as a real temptation to investors but its long-term growth remains unsustainable. On one hand, the currency is a great investment alternative in an environment where interest rates are close to zero. But on the flip side, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional investments, Bitcoin is disproportionately controlled with 95% of the currency controlled by just 2% of the market.\n\nThe recent rally in Dogecoin is a testament to the power of memes. While the price spikes are definitely attractive, it\u2019s also worth noting that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. According to Garrick Hileman of blockchain.com, Dogecoin could lose 90% of its value.\n\nWith this being a real possibility (as we saw with GME and AMC stock), I wouldn\u2019t go all-in on Dogecoin. However, if you want to be a part of the mass market movement, Dogecoin does trade on the cheap and is worth a small investment. Even if things don\u2019t go your way, it could serve as a great learning opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya Premkumar has a finance degree from the University of Houston, Texas.

But in a market also made up of stocks, three Nasdaq-listed crypto plays are offering investors risk-adjusted exposure that\u2019s more secure both off and on the price chart. Let me explain.\n\nBoth Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) have been roiled by policy makers\u2019 rumblings. It\u2019s been a couple weeks since Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen hinted strongly at the U.S. government\u2019s interest in \u2018curtailing\u2019 the crypto market given the decentralized digital currencies\u2019 ties to bad actors and their illicit wheeling and dealings. The warning sent digital currencies tumbling into bear markets. And don\u2019t think for a second that regulatory risks will disappear.\n\nMore important, the crypto market and its tethered blockchain technology are seeing explosive growth and acceptance as an incredibly important tool for business.\n\nAlready Bitcoin is nearing $1 trillion in valuation. Then there are Square (NYSE:SQ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Those titans of finance are some of today\u2019s early large cap adopters of the crypto market. Don\u2019t bet against the house, right? They\u2019re not alone either.\n\nLast week EV giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced a\u00a0purchase of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and plans to accept the market\u2019s biggest digital currency for payment. At the same time Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) announced they\u2019ll begin allowing various financial transactions in select crypto coins.\n\nThe writing appears to be on the wall. Even in the face of stricter future oversight, digital currencies promise to continue providing very lucrative investment opportunities. A word to the wise before jumping in is warranted.\n\nAs we\u2019ve witnessed throughout crypto\u2019s re-emergence to all-time-highs, investors still need to be prepared for wild price action which can induce second-guessing, run-for-the-exits sell orders at the expense of one\u2019s trading account. But is there another way to participate with more defined exposure?\n\nToday, let\u2019s examine three behind-the-scenes crypto stocks within this burgeoning market. Instead of just being wise to the challenges and potential failures ahead, these Nasdaq-listed digital currency plays are offering smarter money strategies which won\u2019t extend or put the wallet at unnecessary and outsized risk.\n\n\nSource: Charts by TradingView\n\nThe first of our crypto stocks to buy are shares of Bit Digital. According to Yahoo Finance the company engages in Bitcoin mining and recently changed its name from Golden Bull to better reflect its business activities. Despite being a fairly new entrant into the space, New York-based BTBT is one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies listed on Nasdaq.\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m always suspect of a company name change and business pivot of this kind. And being lured into a long stock position by year-over-year quarterly sales growth of around 64,000% isn\u2019t a great idea. The fact is revenues for the latest period came in at $13 million compared to a valuation of nearly $850 million for this crypto. It\u2019s steep. Bit Digital also remains in the red.\n\nStill, investors are buying in to the BTBT stock story in a big way and it looks worthy of calculated exposure.\n\nTechnically, Bit Digital recently broke out of a massive corrective cup-shaped base to new all-time-highs to finish off 2020. To complement that bullish price action, in 2021 shares of this crypto have put together a well-supported test of the stock\u2019s prior high.\n\nBTBT has pulled back near its 50% retracement level within a smaller corrective \u2018V-shaped\u2019 base. And coupled with a favorable bullish stochastics crossover, this crypto looks ready for buying into.\n\nFavored Strategy: May $25/$40 Bull Call Spread\n\n\nSource: Charts by TradingView\n\nRiot Blockchain is the next of our crypto stocks to buy. RIOT was one of the digital currency market\u2019s more notorious listed stocks during the asset group\u2019s 2017 \u2013 2018 run-up and subsequent crash. And like BTBT, this diversified blockchain play seemingly came out of nowhere, pivoting and changing its corporate name. It was suspect to say the least. Today however, it\u2019s time to let bygones be bygones.\n\nTechnically, this crypto stock has just taken out its own bubble high. Even a minor correction could cause RIOT stock investors to blink or more aptly, barf, given the stock\u2019s underlying volatility. As much, playing for continued momentum while maintaining ironclad downside risk is the way to position.\n\nFavored Strategy: March $55/$65 Bull Call Spread\n\n\nSource: Charts by TradingView\n\nCanaan is the last of our crypto stocks to buy. China-based CAN is the picks-and-shovels play of today\u2019s stocks. The outfit manufacturers equipment used to mine Bitcoin. Canaan is also involved in the development of blockchain technology and, teasingly, the booming artificial intelligence and data center markets.\n\nTechnically, CAN is gunning for a breakout to all-time-highs as shares muscle their way toward the high of a pattern lifetime cup-shaped base. With the stock jumping past the 76% retracement level and weekly stochastics signaling a bullish crossover in neutral territory, a bit of strategic exposure to this crypto looks ripe today.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong? Let\u2019s not find out. At the same time, investors might consider using CAN\u2019s less desirable price volatility to their advantage by hedging a purchase of this crypto stock with a defined risk and highly flexible collar strategy.\n\nFavored Strategy: April $10/$20 Collar\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Tyler holds, directly or indirectly, positions in listed Bitcoin and Ethereum stocks (GBTC, ETHE and ETCG), but no other securities mentioned in this article.\n\nChris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

Right after the close of the first hourly candlestick, the trading pair began an upswing to 49,600 that took the next three hours. Between 04:00 and 05:00 UTC, BTC/USD rocketed to above 50,000, reaching 50,230 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate, but finished the hour below the open with a high upper wick.\n\nBTC/USD fell once more between 05:00 and 07:00 UTC, reaching 49,200, but bounced back to 49,322 between 07:00 and 09:00 UTC. Another downside corrective price move between 09:00 and 12:00 UTC took the pair to 48,000. That was followed by another spike between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC accompanied by increased trading volumes to the day\u2019s high at 50,662. But BTC/USD was still pressured by the local resistance level at 49,600 and closed the hour at 49,637, which triggered a downside retracement between 13:00 and 14:00 UTC.\n\nBetween 14:00 and 16:00 UTC, the BTC/USD became slightly less volatile, trading between 48,750 and 49,500. But a big bearish candlestick in the hour between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC broke below the 50-period hourly simple moving average and closed at 48,131. Until 20:00 UTC, BTC/USD was mainly staying between 47,800 and 48,750.\n\nThe day\u2019s price action shows that the buying sentiment remains dominant in BTC/USD, as the pair kept on testing 50,000 and showed the highest hourly volumes in the hour of the surge to the day\u2019s high, which also happened to be the latest all-time high for BTC/USD. There is some local downside pressure at 49,600, but it will not be much of a challenge for continued BTC/USD price growth beyond 50,000.\n\nIn our estimation, BTC/USD will continue rising high, with the next target level set well above 50,000. The corporate and institutional demand for Bitcoin is going to continue being a key fundamental factor in supporting the bullish price dynamics in the BTC/USD trading pair.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session of 16th February at 1,781.8. After a dip to 1,750 in the first hour, the trading pair continued upwards in the next four hours, reaching 1,824.75 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate. But after the shooting-star hourly candlestick between 04:00 and 05:00 UTC, the pair began edging down, being pressured by the local resistance at 1,820 and the selling impulse produced by the shooting star.\u00a0\n\nETH/USD slipped down steeply between 06:00 and 06:15, breaching the 50-period hourly simple moving average and reaching 1,782, but still closed the hour of 06:00 UTC at the level of the SMA, which prevented the pair from closing below it in the next three hours. A breakdown below the moving average happened between 10:00 and 11:00 UTC, and ETH/USD briefly reached 1,780 in the following hour, continuing the downside dynamics. However, the sharp rebound between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC with a peak at 1,820 sent the pair back above the 50-period hourly SMA. But the local resistance level at 1,820 once again proved its selling force, sending the pair lower at the close of the hour and triggering a downside retracement one hour later.\n\nBetween 14:00 and 17:00 UTC, the pair slipped lower to 1.750 and was mainly keeping within the boundaries of the price range between 1,728 and 1,765 until 22:00 UTC. ETH/USD also closed the 4-hour candlestick between 12:00 and 16:00 UTC at the level of the 4-hour 50-period SMA. And the next 4-hour candlestick closed below the moving average, indicating a probable continuation of the downside dynamics.\n\nThe downswing to 1,750 in ETH/USD brings closer the event of a downside convergence of the 50-period 4-hour SMA by the 20-period one, which will be a selling signal for ETH/USD. However, it will be presently fair to assume that the pair is trading within a flat channel between 1,812.5 and 1,1710. As long as it is not broken, we can consider this a sideways corrective move that may generate new liquidity for the next upswing that will bring ETH/USD to above 1,800.\n\nPresently, the shrinking trading range on the 4-hour channel in symmetric triangle pattern starting to take shape on the 4-hour timeframe is signaling a possible soon breakout outside the triangle. If that happens, it will most likely be a bullish one since the trading pair is in a bullish daily trend. Thus, we can see ETH/USD attempt to capitalise above 1,800 in the close future.\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin must cost 10X more with 10X less utility to match tulip mania \u2014 Investor", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Cointelegraph", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/xCLb9g_glBGE7Hgw7x2f.g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/25a5b8100a8b5740b7860cf794f07776", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Is in the Shadow of Bitcoin But That May Not Last", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "Thanks to widescale institutional investment into Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), the original cryptocurrency eventually made its way above $52,000, truly a milestone moment for the blockchain economy. Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general. But you should at least know this reality before stepping forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

"App Icon Design", "auther": "James Stanley", "body": "It was a forceful show of strength for the Australian currency this week as AUD hit fresh yearly-highs against the major currencies of USD, JPY and the Euro. In a backdrop where loose for longer rules the day, the hues of optimism around Australia have helped to bring buyers to the bid, driving the currency so far for much of early-2021 trade and, bigger picture, since the pandemic lows were set last March. \n\nThe pair was already on its back foot coming into 2020 trade, reeling from a combination of weakness in the Australian economy along with a general hint of risk aversion that had helped to bring upon a stronger Japanese Yen. Of course, with looming trade wars in the background, \u2018risk on\u2019 sentiment was difficult to muster at the time, and as the coronavirus began to get priced-in to markets early last year, risk aversion reared its ugly head as AUD/JPY tested below the 60.00 level for the first time since the 2008 Financial Collapse. \n\nThat test was fleeting, however, as the psychological level helped to bring buyers back to the bid; and initially, this helped to slow the sell-off. \n\nTo learn more about how psychological levels can function as support/resistance, check out DailyFX Education\n\nAs the risk trade started to return with gusto in April and May, AUD/JPY moved along with it, reversing those prior losses and beginning to show signs of strength. And that theme largely continued through the 2021 open, at which point AUD/JPY began to find resistance around another psychological level at the 80.00 handle. \n\nThis led into back-and-forth price action in January and through the February open, and when I wrote up the Analyst Pick on this setup last week, that gyration had just begun to give way on short-term charts as the inverse head and shoulders pattern that had built on long-term charts began to give way. That breakout has continued to run through this week as AUD/JPY now trades at fresh two-year-highs. \n\nTo learn more about the head and shoulders pattern, and how it can lead to breakouts check out DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDJPY on Tradingview\n\nAt this point, traders not long AUD/JPY have the complicated conundrum of trying to work with an overbought trend after a fresh breakout. And while there\u2019s been ample motive for the development of this trend, there could be pullback potential into next week, and on the four-hour chart below, I\u2019ve identified two possible areas of higher-low support that can keep the door open for bullish trend scenarios. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDJPY on Tradingview\n\nAUD/USD Drives Towards .8000 Big Fig\n\nA similar conundrum presents itself in AUD/USD where a red-hot bullish trend has moved into an overbought state, making for a challenging backdrop to those looking to continue that move. But, similarly, pullbacks could be a possible way of moving forward here, looking to institute trend trading logic after the fresh breakout; and below I look into three different areas of possible higher-low support in AUD/USD. The nearest runs from .7820-.7836, with the deeper zone showing around .7708-.7728. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDUSD on Tradingview\n\nEUR/AUD Moves Towards Long-Term Trendline \n\nWhile the Euro hasn\u2019t been as generally weak as the US Dollar or the Japanese Yen since the pandemic began, more recently, the Euro has been seeing an increasing amount of pressure. But from this week the big takeaway was just how strong the Australian Dollar was and this reflects well in the EUR/AUD chart. \n\nFrom the monthly variety below, we can see where a long-term trendline has come into play this week as the pair has pushed down to fresh two-year-lows. If EUR/AUD does hold this line of support into next week, it could make for an interesting reversal play, particularly for those that are looking to fade this recent round of Aussie strength. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/AUD on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "Euro Forecast: Why Bulls Like EUR/JPY More Than EUR/USD", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/hD.CP8K5AknbE3Yvtv_VBA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/2b1579959f6ef2083a7f7d9790ce37ea", "auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "The world of FX is based on relativity, and relatively speaking, the EU is trailing other developed economies with its vaccination rates, and the EU is growing less robustly than other regions. By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD rangebound between 1.2120-40s, but supported by soft US dollar", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/GKhWpBLqwFPGGomB8aJnKw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/8902a4f64027fa91c191bbbeab75007a", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "EUR/USD has bounced back from session lows of just below the 1.2120 mark in recent trade, saved weakness in the US dollar, but has been unable to get back to last week\u2019s highs around 1.2150 or indeed session highs set early in the European session in the 1.2140s. On the day, the pair trades with modest gains of about 20 pips or 0.15%.\n\nEUR/USD is seemingly back trading in last Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s 1.2120ish-1.2150ish range. It may take a more pronounced weakening of the US dollar (i.e. the Dollar Index dropping back towards 21 January lows of just above the 90.00 level) in order for the pair to break above 1.2150, given subdued appetite towards the euro at the moment. Above 1.2150, however, EUR/USD will find resistance in the form of the 50-day moving average at 1.2155.\n\nSafe havens assets (such as JPY, USD and US government bonds) are struggling on the first trading day of the week, despite the absence of Chinese and North American market participants, both of whom are celebrating respective public holidays (Presidents\u2019 Day in America and still midway through Lunar New Year celebrations in China). Global equity and crude oil markets have been rallying given optimism regarding the state of the global pandemic (the UK hit the crucial milestone of vaccinating it\u2019s 15M most vulnerable citizens and the US is seeing a continued drop in the infection rate whilst it ramps up its vaccination efforts).\n\nPositive pandemic news comes against the already favourable backdrop of expectations for more US fiscal stimulus, ongoing global central bank support and a rapid global economic expansion to begin later in the year as populations in key developed markets hit herd immunity. Hence, US equity index futures have been pushing on to fresh all-time high levels on Monday and US bond yields are also rising (the 10-year is now above 1.21%), though, importantly for USD, real yields remain low (the 10-year TIPS sits at -1.02%). For rising nominal yields to be bullish for the US dollar, they will have to be accompanied by rising real yields (which would make the USD a more attractive investment relative to other currencies).\n\nDespite broad weakness in the US dollar versus the majority of its G10 counterparts (aside from JPY, which is being hit even worse), EUR/USD has failed to garner much by way of upside impetus. Part of that will be due to the lack of market volume at the moment given the absence of US and Chinese players in the market on Monday (due to public holidays). But that does not explain euro underperformance against the likes of GBP, CAD, AUD and NZD.\n\nEuro underperformance versus risk-sensitive FX (like the Australian, Kiwi and Canadian dollars) makes sense given the market\u2019s risk-on tone. Euro weakness versus pound sterling seems to have more to do with the EU\u2019s comparatively sluggish vaccination efforts versus the UK; as noted, the UK hit its 15M vaccinations by mid-February target over the weekend. Nearly one-quarter of the citizens in the UK have now been vaccinated. That compares to just 5% in Germany, 4.9% in Italy, 4.4% in France and 5.3% in Spain. Meanwhile, the US has vaccinated 16% of its population and is not too far behind the UK.\n\nAs long as vaccinations do remain effective against the various Covid-19 variants spreading across the world at the moment, the US and UK are set to reopen their economies much sooner than the EU. For example, the UK is targeting getting the first jab in the arms of all of its adult populations by the end of May. By contrast the EU is expecting to have fully vaccinated only 70% of its adults by the end of September. The Eurozone\u2019s sluggish vaccination performance may well weigh on the euro further.\n\nMeanwhile, though infection rates have been dropping on the mainland, concerns linger regarding the spread of Covid-19 variants (such as that first found in the UK or South Africa); advisors to Italian Health Minister have reportedly been suggesting that the country should impose another nationwide lockdown amid concerns over the spread of new Covid-19 variants. Talk of tougher restrictions in the EU could highlight the bloc\u2019s divergent fortunes when compared to the US and UK, where the momentum is towards easing restrictions.\n\nIn terms of Eurozone news flow on Monday, data this morning was mixed; the bloc\u2019s trade surplus was a little larger than expected in December at EUR 29.2B versus forecasts for a reading of EUR 25.3B. However, Industrial Production data for the same month was a disappointment; the YoY rate of production growth came in at a sluggish -0.8% versus forecasts for -0.3% and the MoM rate of production growth showed a larger than expected monthly drop of 1.6% (versus forecasts for -1.0%).\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD tests recent ranges following USD rebound", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jpDnrc69C.mEvYUEtArlHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/5d45abd22f60a61155a0beab70560d4a", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "The Australian dollar drifted lower through trade on Wednesday, depressed by weakness across equities and a slew of stronger than anticipated US macroeconomic data sets.

Having disappointed in December, US consumers turned out in January marking a 5.1% uptick in spending; well above the 1% anticipated.

EUR/USD is categorized in the class of a risk asset and non USD currency.\n\nEUR/USD\u2019s early break to its 5 year average set remainder 27 currencies on a course of deep perspective as non USD currency pairs had to not only match EUR/USD\u2019s break to significant averages but the 1000 pip rise in GBP/USD, 700 for AUD/USD and other non USD currency pairs traded weekly from overbought to overbought and a non normal price circumstance. EUR/USD\u2019s break threw normal price markets deeply off course since August 2020.\n\nNon USD currency pairs such as DXY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY only option since August 2020 was to concur with EUR/USD and non USD rises by trading deeply oversold week to week and to break 5 and 10 year averages.\n\nEUR/USD and non USD currency pairs as risk assets followed risk asset counterparts in stock markets higher to current richter scale overbought levels. The S&P's at 3900.00's trade at\u00a0 extreme overbought levels. The DAX achieved all time highs. Stock market longs are virtually impossible until a significant correction occurs.\n\nDXY\n\nDXY for example just broke above its 10 year monthly average at 89.95 and contains a long way to travel to the 5 year average at 95.00\u2019s. A currency pair to trade at a 10 year monthly average is not only a low, low price but extraordinary and highlights the magnitude to the\u00a0 rises and falls since last August.\n\nNext averages above to break are located at 91.43, 92.78 then 94.39 and 94.16. DXY from monthly averages 1 to 7 years faces stiff resistance from 94.00's to 95.00's. A break through this brick wall then DXY will travel easily to 97.00's and 99.00's.\n\nDXY below 89.95 targets 86.43, 84.32 and 81.83 at extreme oversold.\n\nTargets for DXY above 89.95 are located at 90.86, above 91.43 then 92.15,\u00a0 92.47 and 92.66. Above 92.78 targets 92.87 and 92.89.\n\nDXY from current ranges from 89.95 to 92.78 trade at its widest ranges. As DXY travels higher then ranges severely compress. The opposite is true for EUR/USD as the higher it trades then ranges open much wider.\n\nDespite a low price and trade below monthly 5 year averages, DXY is mid range to oversold/ overbought.\n\nS&P's\n\nDXY viewed from the S&P's informs trade location miles above the 5 year monthly average at 2722.43 and at overbought to extremes. Overbought S&P's reveals a healthy correction is on the way, DXY higher and EUR/USD as well as non USD currency pairs to follow much lower.\n\nThe S&P's are held by immediate averages at 3257.68, 3119.54 and 2989.17. A correction targets 3598.53, 3416.84 and 3300.20. A 400 point correction to the S&P's assumes DXY travels 300 ish pips higher and\u00a0 breaks above 92.78 to trade between 92.78 to 94.39.\n\nS&P averages from 3257.68 travels every 100 points to 2200.00's at the 10 year monthly average. Current S&P's ranges are fairly suppressed however as S&P's drop then ranges expand as the downside gains progresses.\n\nGold\n\nGold trades above its 5 year monthly average at 1461.20 and trades misaligned to the S&P's. Gold and the DXY are the same assets and should trade below 5 year monthly averages while the S&P's trade above.\n\nGold's drop is held by 1815.65 and below targets 1642.17 and 1543.98. Gold is deeply overbought from a medium and long term perspective. Gold is finished above at 1943.62 and short is the only trade available.\u00a0\n\nMoving forward, long USD and DXY is the best option while short Gold and the S&P's although Gold lacks any real range capability. Gold viewed from 150 to 200 points is a viable option as it fails to contain any big price moves.\n"}, {"headline": "US Dollar Price Action Setups: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, USD/JPY", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "19 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/7my6vELlhsolWkp4HPp58g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/063085c9015523ec17ebca884f284d8c", "auther": "James Stanley", "body": "It was a wash week in the US Dollar as the currency is looking to finish the week very close to where it had started. It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "U.S. Dollar Needs Retail Sales Comeback | Investing.com UK", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Kathy Lien", "body": "\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Currencies Reverse\u00a0Despite New Highs For Stocks\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 USD\u00a0Rallies On Stronger Empire State Survey But Retail Sales A Risk\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 EURO\u00a0Gives Up Gains Despite Stronger ZEW\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 AUD\u00a0Lower On Dovish RBA Minutes\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 GBP\u00a0Traders Look Ahead To Stronger CPI\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CAD\u00a0Sells Off Despite Prospect Of Stronger Inflation Data\n\u00a0\nU.S. traders came back from their long weekend on Tuesday ready for a busy trading week.

It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "Euro Forecast: Why Bulls Like EUR/JPY More Than EUR/USD", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/hD.CP8K5AknbE3Yvtv_VBA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/2b1579959f6ef2083a7f7d9790ce37ea", "auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "The world of FX is based on relativity, and relatively speaking, the EU is trailing other developed economies with its vaccination rates, and the EU is growing less robustly than other regions. By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD: Long, weekly and daily forecasts", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/0wHdbLg6oQ5GYQjQTZyavw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/6ac74574aa0002667e14055fc15983d6", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "In relation to January 3rd long term forecasts and MA inflection points and targets posted once every 3 or 5 months and to 5, 10 and 14 year averages, overall currency market prices stand at critical junctures to travel higher or to embark on a deep correction.\n\nWhen the ECB adopted negative interest rates in June 2014, the EUR/USD was located at\u00a0 highs of 1.3694 then\u00a0 traded to 1.0346 lows or 3348 pips by June 2017 on a continuation of deeper negative rates.

On the day, the pair trades with modest gains of about 20 pips or 0.15%.\n\nEUR/USD is seemingly back trading in last Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s 1.2120ish-1.2150ish range. It may take a more pronounced weakening of the US dollar (i.e. the Dollar Index dropping back towards 21 January lows of just above the 90.00 level) in order for the pair to break above 1.2150, given subdued appetite towards the euro at the moment. Above 1.2150, however, EUR/USD will find resistance in the form of the 50-day moving average at 1.2155.\n\nSafe havens assets (such as JPY, USD and US government bonds) are struggling on the first trading day of the week, despite the absence of Chinese and North American market participants, both of whom are celebrating respective public holidays (Presidents\u2019 Day in America and still midway through Lunar New Year celebrations in China). Global equity and crude oil markets have been rallying given optimism regarding the state of the global pandemic (the UK hit the crucial milestone of vaccinating it\u2019s 15M most vulnerable citizens and the US is seeing a continued drop in the infection rate whilst it ramps up its vaccination efforts).\n\nPositive pandemic news comes against the already favourable backdrop of expectations for more US fiscal stimulus, ongoing global central bank support and a rapid global economic expansion to begin later in the year as populations in key developed markets hit herd immunity. Hence, US equity index futures have been pushing on to fresh all-time high levels on Monday and US bond yields are also rising (the 10-year is now above 1.21%), though, importantly for USD, real yields remain low (the 10-year TIPS sits at -1.02%). For rising nominal yields to be bullish for the US dollar, they will have to be accompanied by rising real yields (which would make the USD a more attractive investment relative to other currencies).\n\nDespite broad weakness in the US dollar versus the majority of its G10 counterparts (aside from JPY, which is being hit even worse), EUR/USD has failed to garner much by way of upside impetus. Part of that will be due to the lack of market volume at the moment given the absence of US and Chinese players in the market on Monday (due to public holidays). But that does not explain euro underperformance against the likes of GBP, CAD, AUD and NZD.\n\nEuro underperformance versus risk-sensitive FX (like the Australian, Kiwi and Canadian dollars) makes sense given the market\u2019s risk-on tone. Euro weakness versus pound sterling seems to have more to do with the EU\u2019s comparatively sluggish vaccination efforts versus the UK; as noted, the UK hit its 15M vaccinations by mid-February target over the weekend. Nearly one-quarter of the citizens in the UK have now been vaccinated. That compares to just 5% in Germany, 4.9% in Italy, 4.4% in France and 5.3% in Spain. Meanwhile, the US has vaccinated 16% of its population and is not too far behind the UK.\n\nAs long as vaccinations do remain effective against the various Covid-19 variants spreading across the world at the moment, the US and UK are set to reopen their economies much sooner than the EU. For example, the UK is targeting getting the first jab in the arms of all of its adult populations by the end of May. By contrast the EU is expecting to have fully vaccinated only 70% of its adults by the end of September. The Eurozone\u2019s sluggish vaccination performance may well weigh on the euro further.\n\nMeanwhile, though infection rates have been dropping on the mainland, concerns linger regarding the spread of Covid-19 variants (such as that first found in the UK or South Africa); advisors to Italian Health Minister have reportedly been suggesting that the country should impose another nationwide lockdown amid concerns over the spread of new Covid-19 variants. Talk of tougher restrictions in the EU could highlight the bloc\u2019s divergent fortunes when compared to the US and UK, where the momentum is towards easing restrictions.\n\nIn terms of Eurozone news flow on Monday, data this morning was mixed; the bloc\u2019s trade surplus was a little larger than expected in December at EUR 29.2B versus forecasts for a reading of EUR 25.3B. However, Industrial Production data for the same month was a disappointment; the YoY rate of production growth came in at a sluggish -0.8% versus forecasts for -0.3% and the MoM rate of production growth showed a larger than expected monthly drop of 1.6% (versus forecasts for -1.0%).\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "GBP, AUD End Week Near 3-Year Highs | Investing.com NG", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "9 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Kathy Lien", "body": ""}, {"headline": "DXY vs S&P's vs Gold", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zsN8_u4ssqAGXoQvoV4ofA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/76825f5773348b586328b2db07473959", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "To respectfully indulge words from the last post for context:\n\nOverall, EUR/USD was the first currency in August 2020 to break above its 5 year average at 1.1300\u2019s then the 10 year average in December 2020 at 1.2100\u2019s.

The S&P's at 3900.00's trade at\u00a0 extreme overbought levels. The DAX achieved all time highs.

The degree of overbought is recognized as 500 pips from AUD/USD 0.7700\u2019s and AUD/JPY at 82.00\u2019s and 500 pips from NZD/USD 0.7100\u2019s to NZD/JPY 76.00\u2019s. Normal is in the vicinity of 100 to 200 pips maximum because NZD/USD and NZD/JPY are the exact same currency pairs much the same as AUD/USD and AUD/JPY.\n\nThe divide grows wider at 800 pips from GBP/USD 1.3600\u2019s to GBP/JPY at 147.00\u2019s and 700 pips from EUR/USD 1.2000\u2019s to 127.00\u2019s for EUR/JPY and normal is 100 to 200 because GBP/USD and GBP/JPY are the exact same currency pairs much the same as EUR/USD and EUR/JPY.\n\nUSD pairs EUR/NZD at 1.6700\u2019s trades 2500 pips to GBP/NZD 1.9200\u2019s.

Short the highs and long the lows.\n\nUSD/JPY highs Vs EUR/USD Lows.\n\nUSD/JPY up target 106.43 vs EUR/USD 1.1985 lows.\n\nUSD/JPY 106.36 Vs EUR/USD 1.1998.\n\nUSD/JPY 106.29 V EUR/USD 1.2011\n\nUSD/JPY 106.16 Vs EUR/USD 1.2015\n\nUSD/JPY 106.09 Vs EUR/USD 1.2023\n\nUSD/JPY 106.03 Vs EUR/USD 1.2028.\n\nUSD/JPY 105.96 Vs EUR/USD 1.2034.\n\nEUR/USD Highs Vs USD/JPY lows\n\nEUR/USD 1.2107 Vs USD/JPY 105.37\n\nEUR/USD 1.2099 Vs USD/JPY 105.44\n\nEUR/USD 1.2091 Vs USD/JPY 105.51\n\nEUR/USD 1.2076 Vs USD/JPY 105.58\n\nEUR/USD 1.2068 Vs USD/JPY 105.63\n\nEUR/USD 1.2061 Vs USD/JPY 105.71\n\nEUR/USD 1.2053 Vs USD/JPY 105.79\n\nEUR/USD 1.2049 Vs USD/JPY 105.87.\n\nEUR/USD is a complete opposite pair to USD/JPY however prices never match pip for pip as the relationship runs 7.62 pips for EUR/USD Vs 6.62 for USD/JPY.As a side note all market prices especially Stock Indices are factored the exact same as a currency price. The difference is in the name and number yet its all the same.\n\nNot many pips trade anymore as the old days of trading therefore pips and profits are maximized by multiple longs and shorts per currency pair.

Bear steepening of yield curves is currently the proponent of that trade. German yields added 1.3 bps to 4.6 bps (10-yr). The German 10-yr yield tested the August top at -0.38%. The 30-yr yield waved goodbye to similar resistance (0.1%) and trades at the highest level since June. UK Gilts underperformed German Bunds with UK yield adding up to 6.7 bps. Markets respond to the UK\u2019s competitive advantage gained through a different vaccination strategy with UK PM Johnson readying a roadmap out of the current lockdown. Earliest dates to free pockets of society/the economy from restricting measures would be announced in the near term. Johnson didn\u2019t want people to become overly optimistic by not guaranteeing the ability to take holidays over Easter (Apr 4). Sterling was the best amongst FX majors with EUR/GBP near the 0.87 big figure and drifting towards 0.8671 support. GBP/USD set a recovery high north of 1.39. UK stock markets (FTSE +2.5%) outperformed continental Europe (>1%). A strong weighting for financials (steeper curve) and commodity-related stocks added to positive UK news flow. Nearly every corner of the commodity markets remains in rallying mode. The arctic blaze over the US Mid-West contributed to higher oil and especially gas prices, both through constraint supply and increased demand. Several soft commodities and metals trade at multiyear highs. Commodity-related currencies shine. EUR/NOK fell below 10.20 yesterday for the first time since March. USD/CAD is near the year-to-date low of 1.26, matching the strongest CAD-level since 2018. AUD/USD performs a similar trick at 0.78.\n\nThe (stock market) party continues in Asia this morning with Japan winning up to 1%. Commodity markets are losing some vigor with the Bund and US Note future off yesterday\u2019s weakest intraday levels. The dollar managed to hold up well yesterday, but underperforms somewhat this morning. From a technical point of view, EUR/USD has difficulties to take out minor intermediate 1.2151 resistance (50% retracement of 2021 decline) with the trade weighted dollar remaining above more important support at 90.13 (62% retracement of that same move). Today\u2019s eco calendar remains poorly filled apart from German ZEW investor sentiment (February) and the US Empire Manufacturing survey (February). Reflation dynamics continue dominating trading, but this morning\u2019s price action suggest slowing momentum compared to Friday and Monday.\n\nThe share of companies rated triple C or below in total junk-bond sales has grown to the highest since 2007 in yet another sign investors are hunting down the rating ladder for yield. FT calculations show that about 15% of junk-bond deals took place in the most riskiest part of the debt market, based on S&P ratings. That figure rises to 21% according to Moody\u2019s bond reviewing. The investor stampede on those bonds has pushed its yield to record lows in recent weeks.\n\nThe European Commission will issue guidance to governments in the spring on when it thinks the budget rules should be observed again. The Stability and Growth Pact rules that limit borrowing to ensure public finance health, were lifted last year to help weather the pandemic. European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Gentiloni told any withdrawal of the support measures in any case would have to be carefully managed to avoid a sharp rise in bankruptcies.\n\nBoJ Governor Kuroda said the recent stock market rally reflects market optimism about the economy going forward and the vaccine rollouts. He added that it was premature to debate an exit from the easy policy that includes ETF purchases. His comments came after growing unease with some lawmakers that the very loose monetary policy is fueling asset price bubbles, especially at a time when Japanese stock indices are setting multidecade highs.\n\nDownload The Full Sunrise Market Commentary\n"}]}, {"id": "EUR/CHF", "price_data": [1.0818500518798828, 1.0816999673843384, 1.0817500352859497, 1.081719994544983, 1.0820000171661377,

"auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "The world of FX is based on relativity, and relatively speaking, the EU is trailing other developed economies with its vaccination rates, and the EU is growing less robustly than other regions. By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "Is the EUR/CHF set for growth?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "The EURCHF has been weak over the last few weeks. This is has been a little surprising especially as the reflation trade has been expected. The EURCHF should be a pair that would find gains on a global synchronised recovery.\n\nHowever, one of the reasons for the euro weakness is the expectations of a double-dip recession. The Eurozone has been slow in vaccinating its population in comparison to the US. If the US economy shows a faster than expected return to normality then any dollar strength will weigh on the euro. Furthermore, the CHF has been gaining as a safe haven currency on risk-off trading surrounding COVID-19 concerns. So, there have been reasons the EURCHF has been pressured.\n\n\n\nHowever, with that being said, there is a decent case to be made for the EURCHF to make a recovery from here. The CHF has long been bought since the Global Financial Crisis and had its shock highs against the EUR as the EURCHF peg was removed. That area serves as the \u2018catastrophic floor\u2019. At present, there is not a reason for the EURCHF to fall back below that level. Especially as the SNB is intervening in the EURCH pair to stop it from going too low. Remember the SNB hate a strong franc.\n\nIf economies are set to rebound on a synchronised global growth narrative then the EURCHF could be a good pair to consider.\n\nThe risk, of course, is that the strength in the CHF is sounding a warning note against the deflation narrative and that markets have got ahead of themselves in the vaccine euphoria. However, will the EURCH FSNB floor hold whatever? There could be a strong case made that they would.

EUR/USD is categorized in the class of a risk asset and non USD currency.\n\nEUR/USD\u2019s early break to its 5 year average set remainder 27 currencies on a course of deep perspective as non USD currency pairs had to not only match EUR/USD\u2019s break to significant averages but the 1000 pip rise in GBP/USD, 700 for AUD/USD and other non USD currency pairs traded weekly from overbought to overbought and a non normal price circumstance. EUR/USD\u2019s break threw normal price markets deeply off course since August 2020.\n\nNon USD currency pairs such as DXY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY only option since August 2020 was to concur with EUR/USD and non USD rises by trading deeply oversold week to week and to break 5 and 10 year averages.\n\nEUR/USD and non USD currency pairs as risk assets followed risk asset counterparts in stock markets higher to current richter scale overbought levels. The S&P's at 3900.00's trade at\u00a0 extreme overbought levels. The DAX achieved all time highs. Stock market longs are virtually impossible until a significant correction occurs.\n\nDXY\n\nDXY for example just broke above its 10 year monthly average at 89.95 and contains a long way to travel to the 5 year average at 95.00\u2019s. A currency pair to trade at a 10 year monthly average is not only a low, low price but extraordinary and highlights the magnitude to the\u00a0 rises and falls since last August.\n\nNext averages above to break are located at 91.43, 92.78 then 94.39 and 94.16. DXY from monthly averages 1 to 7 years faces stiff resistance from 94.00's to 95.00's. A break through this brick wall then DXY will travel easily to 97.00's and 99.00's.\n\nDXY below 89.95 targets 86.43, 84.32 and 81.83 at extreme oversold.\n\nTargets for DXY above 89.95 are located at 90.86, above 91.43 then 92.15,\u00a0 92.47 and 92.66. Above 92.78 targets 92.87 and 92.89.\n\nDXY from current ranges from 89.95 to 92.78 trade at its widest ranges. As DXY travels higher then ranges severely compress. The opposite is true for EUR/USD as the higher it trades then ranges open much wider.\n\nDespite a low price and trade below monthly 5 year averages, DXY is mid range to oversold/ overbought.\n\nS&P's\n\nDXY viewed from the S&P's informs trade location miles above the 5 year monthly average at 2722.43 and at overbought to extremes. Overbought S&P's reveals a healthy correction is on the way, DXY higher and EUR/USD as well as non USD currency pairs to follow much lower.\n\nThe S&P's are held by immediate averages at 3257.68, 3119.54 and 2989.17. A correction targets 3598.53, 3416.84 and 3300.20. A 400 point correction to the S&P's assumes DXY travels 300 ish pips higher and\u00a0 breaks above 92.78 to trade between 92.78 to 94.39.\n\nS&P averages from 3257.68 travels every 100 points to 2200.00's at the 10 year monthly average. Current S&P's ranges are fairly suppressed however as S&P's drop then ranges expand as the downside gains progresses.\n\nGold\n\nGold trades above its 5 year monthly average at 1461.20 and trades misaligned to the S&P's. Gold and the DXY are the same assets and should trade below 5 year monthly averages while the S&P's trade above.\n\nGold's drop is held by 1815.65 and below targets 1642.17 and 1543.98. Gold is deeply overbought from a medium and long term perspective. Gold is finished above at 1943.62 and short is the only trade available.\u00a0\n\nMoving forward, long USD and DXY is the best option while short Gold and the S&P's although Gold lacks any real range capability. Gold viewed from 150 to 200 points is a viable option as it fails to contain any big price moves.\n"}, {"headline": "Euro Price Forecast: EUR/USD to Extend Rebound Ahead of Q4 GDP Print", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "Daniel Moss", "body": "Equity markets continued pushing higher during Asia-Pacific trade, buoyed by progress in the global vaccine rollout and declining coronavirus cases. Australia\u2019s ASX 200 climbed 0.91% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 surged above 30,000 for the first time since 1990, on better-than-expected GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 2020. \n\nIn FX markets, the cyclically-sensitive NOK, AUD, NZD and CAD largely outperformed, while the haven-associated USD, JPY and CHF slipped lower against their major counterparts. Gold price dipped marginally lower as yields on US 10-year Treasuries stormed 5-basis points higher. Looking ahead, trade balance and industrial production figures out of the Euro-area headline a rather light economic docket, with US markets shut for Presidents\u2019 Day. \n\nDailyFX Economic Calendar\n\nAs mentioned in previous reports, growing hopes that a substantial fiscal support package will be delivered by US lawmakers in the coming weeks has fuelled the Euro\u2019s recovery against the US Dollar. The House Budget Committee is expected assemble the various pieces of President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus package this week, with the bill expected to go to the floor of the chamber on February 22. \n\nA swift approval seems relatively likely given House and Senate Democrats have paved the way to pass the majority of the coronavirus-relief package with a simple majority \u2013 in a process called reconciliation. This will likely put further downward pressure on the Greenback in the near term. \n\nMoreover, the Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment to continue purchasing at least $80 billion of Treasury securities and $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities a month \u201cuntil substantial progress has been made toward the Committee\u2019s maximum employment and price stability goals\u201d will probably cap USD\u2019s potential upside. \n\nHowever, the European Union\u2019s cumbersome vaccine rollout could hamper the EUR/USD exchange rate\u2019s upside, considering a meagre 2.65% of the population has received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. To contrast, 17.7% of the UK population and 9.44% of Americans have been inoculated with at least one dose. \n\nUpcoming fourth quarter GDP and employment figures could also take some wind out of the Euro\u2019s sail, if data shows a worse than expected slowdown in the final three months of 2020. Nevertheless, the impending delivery of a substantial aid package out of the US looks set to steer EUR/USD higher in the coming weeks. \n\nEUR/USD daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nFrom a technical perspective, EUR/USD looks poised to extend its recovery from its lowest levels in three months, as price burst back above psychological resistance at 1.2100. \n\nA bullish MACD crossover, in tandem with the RSI snapping its downtrend extending from the December 2020 extremes, suggests the path of least resistance is higher. \n\nA daily close above the February 11 high (1.2149) is required to open the door for prices to challenge psychological resistance at 1.2200. Clearing that likely paves the way for buyers to drive the exchange rate towards the yearly high (1.2349). \n\nAlternatively, slipping back below range support at 1.2055 \u2013 1.2075 could neutralize buying pressure and trigger a downside push back towards the monthly low (1.1952). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 39.06% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.56 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 11.86% higher than yesterday and 4.81% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 0.62% higher than yesterday and 3.62% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is less net-short than yesterday but more net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/USD trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "Weekly Round up Feb 14 2021", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/W_g5AXwSfhErw5QEf6z5Eg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/9aaa70d858e70def64ca4a4dec40d97e", "auther": "Brian Twomey", "body": "Overall, EUR/USD was the first currency in August 2020 to break above its 5 year average at 1.1300\u2019s then the 10 year average in December 2020 at 1.2100\u2019s.

The Canadian dollar (#CAD) fell the most on the back of lower prices and a stronger U.S. dollar.\u00a0Like the U.K., inflation data is scheduled for release tomorrow.\u00a0The price component of IVEY PMI surged signaling stronger price pressures in Canada.\u00a0The Australian dollar (#AUD) was hit by RBA minutes which showed the central bank looking to maintain significant monetary support for some time. \u00a0A 3 day lockdown and weaker New Zealand service sector activity drove\u00a0#NZD/USD\u00a0lower.\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "FOREX-Dollar in doldrums as recovery optimism thrives",

"auther": "James Stanley", "body": "It was a wash week in the US Dollar as the currency is looking to finish the week very close to where it had started. It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/GBP on course for fifth consecutive day in the red with sterling still in favour", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Z7RdnSEZi1YBJ4cnSGqKsQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/b8641d0b92cce97940c26539456146a4", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "EUR/GBP losses have accelerated on Thursday; the pair, which closed below the 0.8700 level for the first time since May 2020 on Wednesday, rose back to momentarily touch 0.8700 during Thursday Asia Pacific trade. However, the arrival of European market participants saw the currency cross take a turn for the worse. EUR/GBP currently trades around the 0.8650 mark, having hit lows just above 0.8640. On the day, the pair trades with losses of about 0.2% or 20 pips and is on course for its fifth consecutive day off losses.\n\nLooking at EUR/GBP from a technical perspective, the pair has broken below a key downtrend that had been acting as support for much of the past few weeks; as the pair fell below the 0.8660s this morning, it broke below a downtrend linking the 31 December 2020, 14, 20 and 21 January and 4 Februarys lows. Thus, though the pair has come a long way over the last few weeks (dropping more than 2% since the start of the month), there may be room for further acceleration to the downside.\n\nNo standout themes or news appear behind the price action on Thursday, though it seems that GBP continues to be a beneficiary of the vaccine trade, i.e. the notion that its world-leading vaccine rollout will facilitate a more aggressive economic recovery later in the year. GBP sits atop the G10 performance table on Thursday, up 0.6% versus the USD.\n\nIn terms of the latest news out of the UK; the Imperial College React study (which tests tens of thousands of people over the course of months at a time) shows that Covid-19 infections have dropped by around two-thirds since the start of the latest national lockdown. On average, the study found that on average 1.57% of people were infected with the virus in early-January, but this has dropped to just 0.51% as of mid-February. In London, the infection rate has dropped from 2.83% in early-January to 0.54%. The fact that lockdown has seemingly worked well should boost government confidence about its ability to rapidly begin to reopen its economy over the summer.\n\nGBP has not been fazed too much by a downbeat survey from the Resolution Foundation, released on Thursday, which showed 2.6M UK employees expect to lose their jobs over the next three months. The survey will up the pressure on UK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak to implement another extension of the furlough scheme and BoE Deputy Governor Michael Saunders said that he would be placing a high weight on labour market outcomes. In other words, if things to take a significant turn for the worse in the UK jobs market, further easing is likely.\n\nTurning to the euro; though suffering versus sterling, the single currency is actually performing quite well versus the majority of the rest of its G10 counterparts. This could be a reflection of the Draghi effect; Italian PM Mario Draghi's government coalition won a vote of confidence in the Senate on Wednesday, with lawmakers voting 262 vs 40 in favour of his new government. The Lower House is expected to also vote in favour and then Draghi can begin pressing ahead with his domestic agenda. Markets seem to have high hopes that Draghi will be able to breathe some life back into the Covid-19 stricken Italian economy, as well as aid further progression of the EU project.\n\nEuro traders appear not too worried about concerning reports that AstraZeneca vaccines have been going to waste in Germany amid health care worker fears about its side effects. German health officials have been urging that the vaccine is safe for use, but mistrust of the vaccine (which has not been helped by recent AstraZeneca vaccine negative comments from various EU officials) may hamper the bloc\u2019s already sluggish vaccine rollout. \u00a0\n\nECB minutes were largely ignored and did not contain any new information on policy. Note that the bank appears to have shifted emphasis towards maintaining ease financing conditions, rather than talking about its price stability mandate, perhaps in anticipation of higher but transitory inflation ahead. This tactic may be aimed at avoiding markets falling into the trap of thinking that the ECB is going to start tightening monetary conditions at the first sign of inflation going above its target.\n\nFinally, the preliminary estimate of January Consumer Confidence in the Eurozone was just released, coming in a tad above expectations at -14.8 (consensus was for -15.0), but down from last month\u2019s -13.9 reading. This is still well below pre-pandemic levels and Capital Economics thinks that \u201cunless vaccine programmes accelerate to allow restrictions to be lifted soon, a sustained pick up in confidence remains months away\u201d.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Chart Of The Day: EUR/USD May Have Started Ascent Towards 1.25", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "18 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "EUR/GBP slides under 0.8700, eyes key support at 0.8670", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/cWIOpkPpRsIX.wo9rhFT_A--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/829ef55ffa8e1b86fecbeb75646199c2", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "EUR/GBP looks on course for a fourth consecutive day of losses on Wednesday, having now broken convincingly to the south of the 0.8700 level. Needless to say, this means the pair has hit fresh multi-month lows. EUR/GBP is eyeing a test of a long-term downtrend that has been supporting the price action since 31 December 2020, which is likely to come into play if EUR/GBP falls into the 0.8660s. Prior to testing this downtrend, however, the pair is going to have to contend with a key support level in the form of the April 2020 low at just under 0.8670. At present, the pair trades in the 0.8680s, down about 0.2% or just under 20 pips on the day.\n\nGBP continues to outperform its mainland counterpart in what seems to be a continuation of the \u201cvaccine trade\u201d; i.e. the idea that the UK\u2019s comparatively rapid vaccine rollout will facilitate a swifter economic reopening, which will lead to UK economic outperformance versus the Eurozone later in the year. Latest reports suggest the government is hoping that all UK adults will have received both of their Covid-19 vaccines by the end of August/September. That compares to expectations in the EU that only 70% of adults will have received ever their first dose of a vaccine by the end of September. Note that a number of desks are turning a little more cautious on GBP given the speed of its rally versus the likes of the euro. ING warned on Tuesday that GBP was starting to look a little overvalued on their short-term fair valuation models and are, as such, turning a little more cautious in the currency in the coming weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, a few other UK domestic factors might also be offering some support to sterling; UK press reports suggest that UK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak might be thinking about reducing employer national insurance contributions and reinstating the \u00a31000 job retention bonus for every worker an employer brings back from furlough. This amounts to more fiscal stimulus and is unlikely to be seen as a negative in the eyes of GBP traders.\n\nBut Sunak is facing pressure from various UK think tanks to increase the level of fiscal stimulus more in line with that of the US; the Institute for Public Policy Research is calling for Britain to \u201cact big\u201d with a \u00a3190B stimulus package to avoid a vicious cycle of business bankruptcies, lay-offs and depressed demand. \u201cThe risk of doing too little far outweighs the risk of doing too much. Joe Biden has understood this. Rishi Sunak should follow his lead,\u201d said Carsten Jung, senior economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research.\n\nElsewhere, UK inflation numbers collected in January were released prior to the start of European trade; headline inflation rose to 0.7% YoY from 0.6% in December, a little above expectations for it to remain unchanged at 0.6%. The YoY rate of Core inflation was also a tad higher than expected, coming in at 1.4% versus forecasts for a 1.3% reading. Meanwhile, Producer Input Prices rose at 1.3% YoY in January, much higher than expectations for a reading of 0.6%.\n\nAccording to UBS Chief Economist Paul Donovan, UK inflation may well be worth watching in the future; the speed and the scale of the UK\u2019s vaccine rollout may mean that the forced savings UK consumers have accumulated over the last year amid lockdown restrictions may well be spent earlier than in other countries whose vaccination programmes lag (assuming restrictions in the UK are eased earlier). The UK may thus serve as an indicator of how post-vaccination \u201creopening\u201d might impact price growth in other countries. Donovan notes that the drop in the UK\u2019s population seen in 2020 (as immigrants preferred to travel home to spend lockdown there) may translate into labour shortages as the service sector opens back up again, which could push up prices. Donovan caveats that spare slack in the economy (i.e. higher levels of unemployment in those who have remained in the UK) and the potential for productivity gains may mitigate these cost pressures.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Pound rally continues as cable breaks back above 1.3900 By Investing.com", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/liwfHNr.qx7MRgcSuebFXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/2274f5a887e73ba99c830a3f57cc7c17", "auther": "", "body": "\n\n\u00a9 Reuters \n\n\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/GBP approaches its five-year uptrend at 0.8588 \u2013 Commerzbank", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/kpBaBwETtSav1fR7ak0LUA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/d2672b77659e1b56a01b34063f41e2c6", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "The EUR/GBP pair is approaching its five-year uptrend at 0.85885 as the 0.8671 April low has been blitzed.

Having opened the session closer to the 0.8750-mark, EUR/GBP has now dropped into the low 0.8720s and the bears have their sights set on a test of the 0.8700 level.\n\nLooking at the pair over a long-term time horizon, it continues to move south within the parameters of a long-term downwards trend channel, which it has respected very well over the past few months. For reference, a downtrend linking the 31 December 2020, 20 and 21 January and 5 February lows form the lower parameter of this downtrend, whilst a downtrend linking the 22, 26 and 28 January highs and 4 and 11 February highs forms the upper parameter of this downtrend. Beyond the 0.8700, it is likely that the bears will be targeting another test of the lower bands of this trend channel, which is likely to come into play around the 0.8680 area.\n\nThe UK hit a key vaccination milestone over the weekend; the country managed to hit a self-imposed target to vaccinate 15M of its most Covid-19 vulnerable citizens by mid-February. Everyone in the first four priority groups in the country has now at least been offered a vaccine. Meanwhile, internal government forecasts reportedly expect the number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients to half over the next month.\n\nGiven the above optimism, the UK government is understandable optimistic and UK PM Boris Johnson said over the weekend that he is to layout his re-opening roadmap on 22 February. Johnson said he will prioritise the re-opening of schools (which is likely to happen on 8 March). The next steps will be to allow non-essential retail to re-open, followed by hospitality. Restrictions on socialising may also be eased on 8 March, with people likely to be permitted to meet with friends as long as it is outdoors, as well as the resumption of some outdoor sports. Note that amid the vaccine success, the PM is facing strong pressure from lockdown-skeptic Conservative MPs who want a rapid easing of restrictions from April.\n\nAll of the above factors continue to underpin GBP outperformance versus the majority of its G10 counterparts; the country\u2019s rapid vaccine rollout and drastic recent improvement in Covid-19 infection trends set the stage for the country to be able to confidently lift Covid-19 related economic restrictions significantly ahead of other developed market peers such as the EU, whose vaccination programme lags the UK\u2019s woefully. This sets the stage for UK economic outperformance versus the EU later in the year, which is boosting GBP.\n\nNote that though infection rates have been dropping on the mainland, concerns linger regarding the spread of Covid-19 variants (such as that first found in the UK or South Africa); advisors to Italian Health Minister have reportedly been suggesting that the country should impose another nationwide lockdown amid concerns over the spread of new Covid-19 variants. Talk of tougher restrictions in the EU highlights whilst there is all this talk of re-opening in the UK highlights the divergent fortunes of the two economic zones and maybe helping to weigh on EUR/GBP.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "British Pound Price Forecast: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, EUR/GBP, GBP/NZD", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "Daniel Moss", "body": "The neutral stance of the Bank of England, falling coronavirus cases and a rapid increase in the rate of local vaccinations may open the door for the British Pound to continue gaining ground against its major counterparts in the short term. Here are the key levels to watch for GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, EUR/GBP and GBP/NZD rates. \n\nGBP/USD daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nGBP/USD looks set to extend its recent push to fresh multi-year highs, as prices burst past psychological resistance at 1.3800. \n\nHowever, bearish RSI divergence suggests that bullish momentum may be fading. Nevertheless, with price tracking above all six moving averages, and the MACD hovering firmly above its neutral midpoint, the path of least resistance seems higher. \n\nA daily close above the February 10 high (1.3866) probably signals the resumption of the primary uptrend and carves a path for buyers to challenge the 61.8% Fibonacci (1.3956). Clearing that brings 1.4000 into the crosshairs. \n\nAlternatively, sliding back below the 8-EMA (1.3797) could trigger a short-term pullback to its \u2018slower\u2019 34-period counterpart (1.3663). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 31.28% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 2.20 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 11.83% lower than yesterday and 3.03% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 5.79% lower than yesterday and 21.69% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests GBP/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nTraders are further net-short than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger GBP/USD-bullish contrarian trading bias.\n\nGBP/JPY daily chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe technical outlook for GBP/JPY rates also remains overtly bullish, as the RSI surges to its most extreme overbought readings since December 2019, and price hurdles key resistance at 2020 high (144.96). \n\nA daily close above the psychologically imposing 146.00 mark is required to pave the way for the exchange rate to probe the December 2019 high (147.95). \n\nHowever, if 146.00 remains intact, sellers may be able to drive price back towards former resistance-turned-support at the 2020 high (144.96). Piercing that likely generates a more extended pullback to the February 1 high (144.10). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 29.67% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 2.37 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 24.64% lower than yesterday and 14.29% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 0.80% lower than yesterday and 10.69% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests GBP/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed GBP/JPY trading bias.\n\nEUR/GBP daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nEUR/GBP seems poised to continue sliding to fresh yearly lows, as price accelerates away from the 8-EMA. \n\nWith the RSI eyeing a push into oversold territory, and the slopes of all three EMAs markedly steepening to the downside, further losses look likely in the near term. \n\nA daily close below the February 5 low (0.8738) likely signals the resumption of the primary downtrend and brings range support at 0.8670 \u2013 0.8690 into play. \n\nConversely, if 0.8730 successfully neutralizes selling pressure, a rebound back towards 0.8800 could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 61.08% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.57 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 2.66% higher than yesterday and 0.54% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 14.00% lower than yesterday and 24.87% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests EUR/GBP prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/GBP trading bias.\n\nGBP/NZD daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nThe GBP/NZD exchange rate\u2019s rebound from the January low seems set to endure in the near term, after price gapped back above the 100-MA and psychological resistance at 1.9200. \n\nThe development of the RSI and MACD are indicative of swelling bullish momentum, as both oscillators track firmly above their respective neutral midpoints. \n\nIf price remains constructively positioned above 1.9150, a push to challenge the sentiment-defining 200-day moving average (1.9378) looks on the cards. \n\nOn the other hand, a daily close below 1.9150 probably intensifies near-term selling pressure and carves a path to retest the monthly low (1.8861)\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/GBP Price Analysis: Bulls target confluence of monthly resistance

"auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "The world of FX is based on relativity, and relatively speaking, the EU is trailing other developed economies with its vaccination rates, and the EU is growing less robustly than other regions. By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/JPY: Weakness stays seen as corrective ahead of strength to 128.67/70 \u2013 Credit Suisse", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "23 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/0zxTXW0vIqVTKLJ6AnfH3A--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bf8e07f06ce52aa42e69fe9d3284a0e0", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "The EUR/JPY pair remains well supported and despite a bearish \u201creversal day\u201d analysts at Credit Suisse look for support at 127.33/30 to ideally hold for strength to 128.67/70 and eventually 130.16.\u00a0\n\n\u201cEUR/JPY weakness has been contained at 127.33/30 and despite the recent \u201creversal day\u201d weakness stays seen as a temporary pullback prior to the rally resuming in due course.

It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "Rising Yields Pressure Equities, ECB Minutes On The Agenda | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y JFD Team", "body": "USD performance G10 currencies\nUSD performance G10 currencies\nUSD performance G10 currencies\nMajor global stock indices performance\nMajor global stock indices performance\nMajor global stock indices performance\nJapan's Nikkei 225 4-hour chart technical analysis\nJapan's Nikkei 225 4-hour chart technical analysis\nJapan's Nikkei 225 4-hour chart technical analysis\nEUR/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis\nEUR/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis\nEUR/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\n"}, {"headline": "FxWirePro: EUR/JPY struggles to extend previous session's gains, focus on German and eurozone PMI...", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "EconoTimes", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "Friday", "body": "EUR/JPY chart - Trading View\u00a0\n\nEUR/JPY was trading largely rangebound at 127.67 at around 05:45 GMT, with session high of 127.86 and low of 127.65.\n\nThe pair ignored a 'Bearish Engulfing' pattern on Wednesday's candle and closed 0.31% higher on Thursday's trade.\n\nHowever, bulls are struggling to extend gains as markets turn cautious with fresh coronavirus (COVID-19) variants reported.\n\nJapanese health authorities came out with more disappointment suggesting a new strain of the deadly virus.\n\nOn the data front, Japan\u2019s National Consumer Price Index recovered from -1.2% to -0.6% YoY in January.

Normal is in the vicinity of 100 to 200 pips maximum because NZD/USD and NZD/JPY are the exact same currency pairs much the same as AUD/USD and AUD/JPY.\n\nThe divide grows wider at 800 pips from GBP/USD 1.3600\u2019s to GBP/JPY at 147.00\u2019s and 700 pips from EUR/USD 1.2000\u2019s to 127.00\u2019s for EUR/JPY and normal is 100 to 200 because GBP/USD and GBP/JPY are the exact same currency pairs much the same as EUR/USD and EUR/JPY.\n\nUSD pairs EUR/NZD at 1.6700\u2019s trades 2500 pips to GBP/NZD 1.9200\u2019s. Normal trades around 1600 to 1800 pips and 700 pips off kilter.\n\nThe EUR/USD and USD/JPY relationship is distinguished by the massive and extreme divide between and among currency pair prices, particularly USD and overall cross pairs as the primary driver to current prices.\n\nToday\u2019s trade is presented as a two trade option by matching significant day trade support, resistance and levels. Short the highs and long the lows.\n\nUSD/JPY highs Vs EUR/USD Lows.\n\nUSD/JPY up target 106.43 vs EUR/USD 1.1985 lows.\n\nUSD/JPY 106.36 Vs EUR/USD 1.1998.\n\nUSD/JPY 106.29 V EUR/USD 1.2011\n\nUSD/JPY 106.16 Vs EUR/USD 1.2015\n\nUSD/JPY 106.09 Vs EUR/USD 1.2023\n\nUSD/JPY 106.03 Vs EUR/USD 1.2028.\n\nUSD/JPY 105.96 Vs EUR/USD 1.2034.\n\nEUR/USD Highs Vs USD/JPY lows\n\nEUR/USD 1.2107 Vs USD/JPY 105.37\n\nEUR/USD 1.2099 Vs USD/JPY 105.44\n\nEUR/USD 1.2091 Vs USD/JPY 105.51\n\nEUR/USD 1.2076 Vs USD/JPY 105.58\n\nEUR/USD 1.2068 Vs USD/JPY 105.63\n\nEUR/USD 1.2061 Vs USD/JPY 105.71\n\nEUR/USD 1.2053 Vs USD/JPY 105.79\n\nEUR/USD 1.2049 Vs USD/JPY 105.87.\n\nEUR/USD is a complete opposite pair to USD/JPY however prices never match pip for pip as the relationship runs 7.62 pips for EUR/USD Vs 6.62 for USD/JPY.As a side note all market prices especially Stock Indices are factored the exact same as a currency price. The difference is in the name and number yet its all the same.\n\nNot many pips trade anymore as the old days of trading therefore pips and profits are maximized by multiple longs and shorts per currency pair. All information is known in advance of the trade therefore no stops, charts and whatever is needed nor applied.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  EUR/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Test Of Support At 1.2040 \n-  AUD/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Australian Dollar Moves Higher Against U.S. Dollar \n-  3 Silver Stocks with a Shiny Outlook \n-  GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Motor Higher \n-  EUR/USD Mid-Session Technical Analysis for February 18, 2021 \n-  GBP/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Support At 1.3835 In Sight \n"}, {"headline": "Australian Dollar Technical Forecast: AUD/USD, AUD/JPY, EUR/AUD", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "11 hours ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "James Stanley", "body": "It was a forceful show of strength for the Australian currency this week as AUD hit fresh yearly-highs against the major currencies of USD, JPY and the Euro. In a backdrop where loose for longer rules the day, the hues of optimism around Australia have helped to bring buyers to the bid, driving the currency so far for much of early-2021 trade and, bigger picture, since the pandemic lows were set last March. \n\nThe pair was already on its back foot coming into 2020 trade, reeling from a combination of weakness in the Australian economy along with a general hint of risk aversion that had helped to bring upon a stronger Japanese Yen. Of course, with looming trade wars in the background, \u2018risk on\u2019 sentiment was difficult to muster at the time, and as the coronavirus began to get priced-in to markets early last year, risk aversion reared its ugly head as AUD/JPY tested below the 60.00 level for the first time since the 2008 Financial Collapse. \n\nThat test was fleeting, however, as the psychological level helped to bring buyers back to the bid; and initially, this helped to slow the sell-off. \n\nTo learn more about how psychological levels can function as support/resistance, check out DailyFX Education\n\nAs the risk trade started to return with gusto in April and May, AUD/JPY moved along with it, reversing those prior losses and beginning to show signs of strength. And that theme largely continued through the 2021 open, at which point AUD/JPY began to find resistance around another psychological level at the 80.00 handle. \n\nThis led into back-and-forth price action in January and through the February open, and when I wrote up the Analyst Pick on this setup last week, that gyration had just begun to give way on short-term charts as the inverse head and shoulders pattern that had built on long-term charts began to give way. That breakout has continued to run through this week as AUD/JPY now trades at fresh two-year-highs. \n\nTo learn more about the head and shoulders pattern, and how it can lead to breakouts check out DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDJPY on Tradingview\n\nAt this point, traders not long AUD/JPY have the complicated conundrum of trying to work with an overbought trend after a fresh breakout. And while there\u2019s been ample motive for the development of this trend, there could be pullback potential into next week, and on the four-hour chart below, I\u2019ve identified two possible areas of higher-low support that can keep the door open for bullish trend scenarios. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDJPY on Tradingview\n\nAUD/USD Drives Towards .8000 Big Fig\n\nA similar conundrum presents itself in AUD/USD where a red-hot bullish trend has moved into an overbought state, making for a challenging backdrop to those looking to continue that move. But, similarly, pullbacks could be a possible way of moving forward here, looking to institute trend trading logic after the fresh breakout; and below I look into three different areas of possible higher-low support in AUD/USD. The nearest runs from .7820-.7836, with the deeper zone showing around .7708-.7728. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDUSD on Tradingview\n\nEUR/AUD Moves Towards Long-Term Trendline \n\nWhile the Euro hasn\u2019t been as generally weak as the US Dollar or the Japanese Yen since the pandemic began, more recently, the Euro has been seeing an increasing amount of pressure. But from this week the big takeaway was just how strong the Australian Dollar was and this reflects well in the EUR/AUD chart. \n\nFrom the monthly variety below, we can see where a long-term trendline has come into play this week as the pair has pushed down to fresh two-year-lows. If EUR/AUD does hold this line of support into next week, it could make for an interesting reversal play, particularly for those that are looking to fade this recent round of Aussie strength.

anticipated.\n- EUR/USD lacks bullish potential in the near-term, needs to regain 1.2100.\n\nThe EUR/USD pair edged higher on Thursday, as demand for the greenback somehow receded. The risk-related sentiment turned sour and Wall Street plummeted after its overseas counterpart traded dully. Optimism faded after the European Central Bank published the Meeting Accounts, as policymakers noted that ample monetary stimulus remains essential, pretty much the same stance the US Federal Reserve offered a day before. Softer Treasury yields also played their role, pushing the dollar lower.\n\nData wise, the US published Initial Jobless Claims for the week ended February 12. The number of people seeking jobs increased to 861K, much worse than the 765K expected, and in line with the Fed\u2019s view of a softening recovery in the sector. January Housing Starts plunged 6% in the month, while Building Permits were up 10.4%. The EU released the Consumer Confidence Indicator, which rose to -14.8 in February from -15.5 in the previous month.\n\nThis Friday, the focus will be on Markit preliminary estimates of its PMIs for the EU and the US. The market expects business activity to have shrunk from its previous monthly readings, with the European services sector seen falling further into contraction territory.\n\nEUR/USD Short-Term Technical Outlook\n\nThe EUR/USD pair has traded as high as 1.2089, now developing a few pips above the level. Throughout the American session, the pair has met buyers around 1.2060, where the pair has the 38.2% retracement of its November/January rally. Chances of a steeper advance seem limited in the near-term, as, in the 4-hour chart, the pair was incapable of recovering above any moving average. The Momentum indicator advances within negative levels, but the RSI indicator has turned flat around 48, signaling limited buying interest.\n\nSupport levels: 1.2060 1.2020 1.1970\n\nResistance levels: 1.2110 1.2160 1.2200\n\nView Live Chart for the EUR/USD\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n- Click here for options trades from Benzinga\n- AUD/USD Forecast: Little Chances Of Raising As Long As It Holds Below 0.7770\n- EUR/USD Forecast: Turned Bearish In The Near-Term And Could Retest The 1.1951 Level\n\n\u00a9 2021 Benzinga.com.

However, the entire economy is not out of the woods yet as lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus hammered the bloc\u2019s dominant service industry.\n\nIHS Markit\u2019s flash composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, nudged closer to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, registering 48.1 in February compared to January\u2019s 47.8. A Reuters poll had predicted 48.0. However, some of that activity was from completing old orders. The backlogs of work index fell to 47.9 from 49.0.\n\nAt 12:46 GMT, the EUR/USD is trading 1.2134, up 0.0042 or +0.35%.\n\nLater today at 14:45 GMT, the United States will release data on Flash Manufacturing PMI and Flash Services PMI. Both are expected to show slight decreases from the previous month\u2019s readings.\n\nThe main trend is down according to the daily swing chart. A trade through 1.2190 will change the main trend to up. The downtrend will be reaffirmed on a trade through 1.1952.\n\nThe minor trend is also down. A trade through 1.2170 will change the minor trend to up. This will also shift momentum to the upside. Taking out 1.2023 will indicate the selling is getting stronger.\n\nThe main retracement zone support is 1.2074 to 1.2010. This zone stopped the selling on Wednesday at 1.2023.\n\nThe short-term range is 1.2349 to 1.1952. Its retracement zone is potential resistance. It stopped the buying at 1.2170 on Tuesday. This zone is also controlling the upside direction of the EUR/USD.\n\nThe early price action suggests the direction of the EUR/USD into the close will be determined by trader reaction to 1.2151.\n\nA sustained move over 1.2151 will indicate the presence of buyers. This could lead to a labored rally with potential resistance coming in at 1.2170, 1.2190 and 1.2197.\n\nThe trigger point for a potential acceleration to the upside is 1.2197. The daily chart indicates there is not visible resistance until the January 6 main top at 1.2349.\n\nA sustained move under 1.2151 will signal the presence of sellers. This could create the downside momentum needed to challenge the main 50% level at 1.2074. This is followed by 1.2023 and 1.2010.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Strengthen \n-  Natural Gas Price Fundamental Daily Forecast \u2013 Massive Draw Expected in Next Week\u2019s EIA Report \n-  AUD/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Australian Dollar Breaks Ou tAagain \n-  USD/CAD Daily Forecast \u2013 Test Of Support At 1.2590 \n-  AUD/USD Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Australian Dollar Breaks Out \n-  Silver Price Daily Forecast \u2013 Silver Moves Higher Ahead Of The Weekend \n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Euro Finds Support at Crucial Level", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "19 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/giVmcdNbB9rmxxDl1CYPig--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/591588a8a8c5316a3078215676033827", "auther": "Christopher Lewis", "body": "The Euro has fallen a bit during the course of the week but then turned around to wake up yet again. By doing so, it shows just how well supported this market is, and at this point I do believe that what we are seeing here is an attempt to get back towards the 1.23 handle.\n\nThat is an area that has a significant amount of resistance built into it that extends all the way to the 1.25 handle. I think it would be difficult to break above all of that, but in general it looks like we are going to at least try to get there. Ultimately, I think this is a market that is more or less going to grind sideways in a 300 point range between 1.20 and 1.23 while we trying to build up enough momentum to make a bigger move.\n\nThe ship the candlestick is a hammer which is of course a very bullish sign and will attract a certain amount of buying pressure. Having said that, I do not necessarily see the catalyst to go much higher, due to the fact that the European Union has rolling lockdowns and of course concerns about vaccinations being distributed, and then we have the interest rates in America rising, which does make the US dollar little bit more attractive.\n\nHaving said that, I think this is more or less back and forth and noisy trading. I think it is going to be difficult to trade this from a longer-term perspective in the short term, but one would have to believe that we are trying to build a case to go higher.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Go Parabolic \n-  GBP/USD Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Fly High \n-  GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Strengthen \n-  USD/CAD Daily Forecast \u2013 Test Of Support At 1.2590 \n-  Silver Price Forecast \u2013 Silver Markets for Massive Hammer \n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Testing 200 Day EMA \n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Euro Moves Higher Ahead Of The Weekend", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/UmH3ZT8yJt_mw2snXldgAQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/356ed16983647d27f404d30302fce2c6", "auther": "Vladimir Zernov", "body": "EUR/USD Video 19.02.21.\n\nEUR/USD is currently trying to settle above the resistance level at the 20 EMA at 1.2100 while the U.S. dollar is mostly flat against a broad basket of currencies.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index has recently made an attempt to settle below the nearest support level at 90.50 but failed to develop sufficient downside momentum.

Having given up 0.78 US cents, the AUD remained largely range bound through the domestic session bouncing between 0.7740 and 0.7770 before marking fresh daily and weekly lows at 0.7725 following a massive upward surprise in US retail sales. Having disappointed in December, US consumers turned out in January marking a 5.1% uptick in spending; well above the 1% anticipated. The strong print was supported by gains in PPI inflation, industrial production and home sales which suggest the US economy is stronger than first anticipated. Having drifted back toward 0.7750 on open, our attentions now turn to domestic employment data. The monthly labour market report remains a crucial measure of recovery and a key marker for the RBA. Material improvements in job creation and a depreciation in unemployment would likely mean the RBA current QE program will not extend beyond September, while a poor print ahead of relaxed Jobseeker and JobKeeper benefits, next month may prompt calls for extend stimulus, weighing on the AUD. We anticipate an improvement and reduction to 6.4%.\n\nThe dollar index advanced through trade on Wednesday up 0.3% following higher bond rates and stronger than anticipated domestic retail sales. Following a soft showing in December, consumer spending rebounded strongly in January up 5.1% month on month, well beyond the 1.1% growth anticipated and raising some concerns inflation pressures may accelerate as fiscal stimulus is introduced to the economy. The dollar advanced against both the GBP and euro driving the index higher. Sterling drifted below 1.39 and touched 1.3830 before settling above 1.3850 into this morning\u2019s open. The euro slipped below 1.21 forced to lows at 1.2030. Europe remains behind the US and UK when comparing vaccination schedules while the stronger US macroeconomic showing highlighted the divergence in economic performance and growth expectations.

The pair is thus within striking distance of the 2021 high set right at the start of January of just shy of the 0.7320 level. With gains of roughly 1.2% versus this US dollar, Friday is shaping up to be the kiwi\u2019s best since 9 October 2020.\n\nOn the week, the currency is now\u00a0vying for first place in the G10 ranking with GBP and AUD, all trading with weekly gains versus the US dollar of between 1.2-1.4%. On the month, NZD is the third-best performer after GBP and AUD, up about 2% versus USD.\n\nThe kiwi currently sits atop the G10 FX performance table, though specific news or events can be definitively pointed at as supporting the currency. For what its worth, Q4 PPI data released during Friday\u2019s Asia Pacific session did not appear to influence the price action much; input prices were unchanged in the quarter, down from growth of 0.6% in Q3, whilst Output price growth accelerated to 0.4% from its -0.3% contraction in Q3.\n\nMarkets have been in a generally risk-on mood on Friday and this is supporting risk-sensitive currencies such as NZD; stock markets are yet to take the recent run higher in global bond yields as a negative and the S&P 500 continues to trade comfortably above the 3900 level, not far from recent record levels. US President Joe Biden is expected to say that the US is not looking for a new cold war with China at the G7 summit, constructive commentary that may ease some concerns about the potential for relations to further deteriorate. Biden is still expected to call for democracies to challenge the country\u2019s abusive practises, however. Meanwhile, preliminary Markit PMI data for February out of Australia, the UK and US were decent, implying that the recovery in these countries remains on track as global vaccine rollouts continue. On which note, vaccine appears to lower Covid-19 infections and transmission rates by two-thirds, according to the Telegraph citing data set to be released later this month by Public Health England.\n\nWhilst the above is all very well and good for the kiwi, support also appears to be coming from movements in Australia and New Zealand\u2019s bond markets; yields in the former have surged since the start of the European session, with Australian 10-year bond yields currently up more than 7bps on the day at close to 1.49% following a change to Westpac\u2019s year-end bond yield forecast (which was revised higher to 1.9% from 1.5%. When New Zealand\u2019s bond markets re-open on Monday, similar upside is likely to be seen in bond yields there. That means the country\u2019s 10-year yield could be substantially higher than its Friday closing level at 1.517%, which was already amongst the highest yielding developed market 10-year notes.\n\nNZD/USD four hour chart\n\n\n"}, {"headline": "FxWirePro: GBP/AUD remains bullish as rally continues - EconoTimes", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "EconoTimes", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "Tuesday", "body": "\u2022 \u00a0GBP/AUD rally extended towards 1.7900 on Tuesday as sterling continued to enjoy a boost \u00a0from UK's rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u2022 The rallied above 1.7900 level, lift stops after finding resistance at 1.7919 (23.6%fib).\n\n\u2022 GBP/AUD remains strongly bullish, only a break and daily close below 1.7778 will shift bias to the downside.\n\n\u2022 Technical are bullish, daily RSI is negative at 57, daily momentum studies \u00a05,9 and 11 DMAs are trending north.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 Immediate resistance is located at 1.7919 (38.2%fib ), any close above will push the pair towards 1.8000 (Psychological level).\n\n\u2022 Strong support is seen at 1.7620 (5DMA) and break below could take the pair towards 1.7778 (50%fib).\n\n\u00a0Recommendation: Good to buy \u00a0 around 1.7900, with stop loss of 1.7800 and target price of 1.8050.\r\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "U.S. Dollar Needs Retail Sales Comeback | Investing.com UK", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Kathy Lien", "body": "\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Currencies Reverse\u00a0Despite New Highs For Stocks\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 USD\u00a0Rallies On Stronger Empire State Survey But Retail Sales A Risk\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 EURO\u00a0Gives Up Gains Despite Stronger ZEW\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 AUD\u00a0Lower On Dovish RBA Minutes\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 GBP\u00a0Traders Look Ahead To Stronger CPI\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CAD\u00a0Sells Off Despite Prospect Of Stronger Inflation Data\n\u00a0\nU.S. traders came back from their long weekend on Tuesday ready for a busy trading week.

Employment data showed employment levels are returning to near pre-pandemic levels, with the unemployment rate falling below 6.5% to 6.4% as another 30,000 jobs were added to the economy. The outlook continues to improve with most industries now reporting almost full employment, with job losses now targeted to those worst hit by the pandemic, namely tourism and entertainment. As the vaccine roll-out begins this month, there is hope forward indicators will show further growth moving into Q2, easing pressure on the RBA to maintain long run QE programs.\n\nWith little of note on the domestic docket our attentions turn to a raft of European and US PMI data. Markets are pricing in some slippage through February as lockdowns and frigid weather temper economic activity. We are keenly attuned to any divergence in economic performance; softness across European data sets could force the single currency back toward 1.20 and allow the AUD to test resistance at 0.6450.\n\nVolatility across currency markets remained subdued through trade on Thursday with little headline newsflow or data points to spark a wholesale shift in direction.

While we expect volatility will remain muted, a divergence in economic performance could spark euro softness leading into the weekly close.\n\nAUD/USD: 0.7720 - 0.7790 \u25bc\n\nAUD/EUR: 0.6380 - 0.6450 \u25bc\n\nGBP/AUD: 1.7820 - 1.8180 \u25b2\n\nAUD/NZD: 1.0720 - 1.0820 \u25bc\n\nAUD/CAD: 0.9810 - 0.9890 \u25b2\n"}, {"headline": "GBP/USD consolidates not far from 1.4000 as bulls remain in control", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/vbTee0Ei8K2.N.fTTf60gg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/f99d3bfea17cee984cdabad5d85d6ba2", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "GBP/USD is on course for its strongest one-day gain since 12 January, up more than 0.8% or about 120 pips on the day and came ever so close to touching the 1.4000 level for the first time since April 2018 midway through the European trading session. The pair has spent most of the last eight or so hours consolidating in the upper 1.3900s as bulls catch their breath ahead of what they will hope is the next leg higher for the currency pair.\n\nOn the week, GBP is far and away now the best performing currency in the G10, up nearly 1.0% versus the US dollar. That compares to the euro, which is down 0.2% and JPY which is down 0.7%. On the month, it\u2019s a similar story, with GBP the best performer and up more than 2.0% versus the US dollar. AUD is not too far behind, up 1.75% versus the US dollar, and was the best performer on the month prior to Thursday\u2019s session. GBP\u2019s stellar performance compares to the euro, which is down 0.3% and JPY, which is down 0.9%.\n\nGBP continues to benefit from vaccine optimism-related tailwinds, with the country now having surpassed 16.4M vaccine doses delivered, up nearly 500K on the day. If the government can maintain this pace, all adults should have been offered their first vaccine by the government\u2019s target of the end of May.\n\nSterling bulls are also drawing hope from the continued sharp drop in Covid-19 infections, hospitalisations and deaths in the UK. The ongoing Imperial College of London study that tests tens of thousands of UK citizens every week to estimate the prevalence of the virus in the community shows that the number of currently infected persons has dropped by two-third since the start of January to around 0.5% of the population.\n\nIt remains unclear at this point as to how much of that is down to the lockdown and how much of that is down to the vaccines. Data from Israel, whose vaccination drive is well ahead of the UK\u2019s in terms of the percentage of the population who has been vaccinated, has been conclusive in showing that vaccines do cause infections to fall. Over the next two months, the government will be expecting to see infection rates drop disproportionately in vaccinated groups versus unvaccinated groups and confirmation that this is the case, alongside falling infection rates, will set the stage for reopening.\n\nAn early reopening timetable compared to many of its major developed market peers is likely to result in UK economic outperformance, as the \u201cpost-Covid-19\u201d recovery gets started early. UK consumers have built up a large buffer of savings over the past year amid closures in the service sector (i.e. hospitality and tourism) and expectations are for pent-up demand to be unleashed over the summer.\n\nIt is worth noting some downside risks to the above-outlined scenario, however; a survey by the Resolution Foundation, released on Wednesday, showed that about 2.6M UK workers, or 8% of the workforce, expect to lose their jobs in the next three months. The UK government can keep this number down and minimise the economic damage of such losses if it opts to extend its furlough job retention scheme. But if it opts to go down the more fiscally conservative route, job losses may be a drag on the post-Covid-19 recovery.\n\nUK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak will have some hard thinking to do ahead of the unveiling of his next budget on 3 March. Most analysts expect that given the high pressure on fiscal policymakers to over rather than under-deliver across the globe, Sunak will extend the scheme. Separately, Sunak is expected to announce an extension of the business rates holiday for the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors, which had been expected to end on 31 March.\n\nMeanwhile, latest reports from the FT suggest that Sunak is going to delay a review of business rates until the Autumn budget; the review is expected to make the case for a digital sales tax to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d between online and high street retailers.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD Vs USD/JPY and the FX Cross Pair Divide", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/rNkBPK9aa9Jmz49Ee7qjAg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/1bc8588b51831e795c1f03b377aa14d3", "auther": "Brian Twomey", "body": "Overall currency markets are in the great deadlock between natural opposites EUR/USD and USD/JPY.

Jobless claims also jumped from 793,000 to 861,000 last week. Building permits rose 10%, but this improvement was offset by a drop in housing starts.\u00a0Ultimately, none of these reports are high-impact data for the U.S. dollar but they reinforced the lack of demand for the greenback. Sterling benefitted the most from U.S. dollar weakness, with GBP/USD traders driving the pair towards 1.40.\u00a0With no UK data to spark these gains, the move was purely technical.\n\u00a0\nFriday will be busy for forex traders, with many market-moving economic reports scheduled for release.\u00a0The focus, however, will be on other currencies and not the U.S. dollar because the only U.S. release, existing home sales, typically does not inspire big moves. So instead, the U.S. dollar will take its cue from stocks and yields.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKeep an eye on sterling because the question of whether GBP/USD breaks or fails at 1.40 will be determined by Friday\u2019s UK retail sales and PMI reports.\u00a0We know from the British retail consortium\u2019s own measure that consumer spending was very weak at the start of the year as they reported the slowest rise since May.\u00a0Economists are also looking for a significant decline. Ongoing restrictions should point to weaker PMIs even as we look forward to a strong second-half recovery. All of this suggests that the path of least resistance for GBP/USD in the near term should be lower.\n\u00a0\nEurozone PMIs are also on the calendar. Like the UK, ongoing restrictions should mean subdued economic activity. Last week, Germany extended its lockdown until March 14\u00a0at the earliest.\u00a0Although new virus cases have come down significantly, the government is concerned about how rapidly the UK variant is spreading.\u00a0The longer restrictions remain in place, the longer it will take for the economy to recover.\u00a0According to the ECB minutes, Eurozone policy-makers felt that ample monetary stimulus remained essential.\u00a0We are still looking for EUR/USD to test 1.20. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Australian dollar traded higher on the back of a stronger labor market report.\u00a0Although the total number of jobs created last month was less than expected and fewer than the previous month, the details of the report revealed more strength than weakness.\u00a0All of the jobs lost were part time with full-time employment growing by 59,000.\u00a0The unemployment rate also dropped to 6.4% from 6.6%, a sign that the country\u2019s labor market recovery is intensifying. Australian retail sales and PMIs are due for release this evening. With the country in the midst of a post-COVID recovery, all signs point to stronger data.\u00a0The same is true for New Zealand, which should see producer prices rise alongside consumer prices. The only outlier is Canada. Retail sales should be weak given the drop in wholesale sales and deterioration in labor market conditions.\u00a0Given the abundance of non-U.S. data, the greatest opportunities may be in currency crosses on Friday.\n\u00a0\n"}]}, {"id": "GBP/JPY", "price_data": [138.67999267578125, 138.8179931640625, 139.01699829101562, 138.8990020751953, 138.77699279785156, 138.44000244140625,

It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "GBP/JPY Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Skyrocket Against Yen", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "19 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/POTClfmhrrzirWW4vSHU.A--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/3042877532cb79362c653fa37a00811e", "auther": "Christopher Lewis", "body": "The British pound has gone parabolic again, with this week gaining 250+ pips against the Japanese yen. That being said, we are a bit overcooked, but I do think that the market is trying to get to the \u00a5150 level. That is an area that will probably be very noisy to say the least, but I do think that it is probably only going to be a matter of time before we have to test it.\n\nWhen you look at the longer-term chart, it is an area that a lot of people have been interested than before, and it could define the longer-term trend overall. Nonetheless, at this point momentum becomes a serious concern.\n\nAfter all, markets cannot go straight up in the air forever, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would be cautious and look for some type of pullback in order to get involved. In that scenario, I think that there will be a lot of buyers near the \u00a5147 level based upon the daily chart, and most certainly at the \u00a5145 level based upon the weekly chart.\n\nWhile I do believe that we get to the \u00a5150 level eventually, I just have learned over the years that it is not very safe to buy a currency pair that has gone this parabolic. It is not that it cannot work, it is just that when it does not work, it tends to fail rather spectacularly. Regardless, I have no interest in shorting this currency pair, and I do believe that a lot of questions will be answered closer to the \u00a5150 handle.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Continues to Grind Higher \n-  AUD/USD Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Australian Dollar Breaks Out \n-  GBP/JPY Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Skyrocket Against Yen \n-  GBP/USD Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Fly High \n-  Silver Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Silver Markets Form a Hammer for The Week \n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Testing 200 Day EMA \n"}, {"headline": "British Pound Price Forecast: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, EUR/GBP, GBP/NZD", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "Daniel Moss", "body": "The neutral stance of the Bank of England, falling coronavirus cases and a rapid increase in the rate of local vaccinations may open the door for the British Pound to continue gaining ground against its major counterparts in the short term. Here are the key levels to watch for GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, EUR/GBP and GBP/NZD rates. \n\nGBP/USD daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nGBP/USD looks set to extend its recent push to fresh multi-year highs, as prices burst past psychological resistance at 1.3800. \n\nHowever, bearish RSI divergence suggests that bullish momentum may be fading. Nevertheless, with price tracking above all six moving averages, and the MACD hovering firmly above its neutral midpoint, the path of least resistance seems higher. \n\nA daily close above the February 10 high (1.3866) probably signals the resumption of the primary uptrend and carves a path for buyers to challenge the 61.8% Fibonacci (1.3956). Clearing that brings 1.4000 into the crosshairs. \n\nAlternatively, sliding back below the 8-EMA (1.3797) could trigger a short-term pullback to its \u2018slower\u2019 34-period counterpart (1.3663). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 31.28% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 2.20 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 11.83% lower than yesterday and 3.03% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 5.79% lower than yesterday and 21.69% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests GBP/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nTraders are further net-short than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger GBP/USD-bullish contrarian trading bias.\n\nGBP/JPY daily chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe technical outlook for GBP/JPY rates also remains overtly bullish, as the RSI surges to its most extreme overbought readings since December 2019, and price hurdles key resistance at 2020 high (144.96). \n\nA daily close above the psychologically imposing 146.00 mark is required to pave the way for the exchange rate to probe the December 2019 high (147.95). \n\nHowever, if 146.00 remains intact, sellers may be able to drive price back towards former resistance-turned-support at the 2020 high (144.96). Piercing that likely generates a more extended pullback to the February 1 high (144.10). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 29.67% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 2.37 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 24.64% lower than yesterday and 14.29% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 0.80% lower than yesterday and 10.69% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests GBP/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed GBP/JPY trading bias.\n\nEUR/GBP daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nEUR/GBP seems poised to continue sliding to fresh yearly lows, as price accelerates away from the 8-EMA. \n\nWith the RSI eyeing a push into oversold territory, and the slopes of all three EMAs markedly steepening to the downside, further losses look likely in the near term. \n\nA daily close below the February 5 low (0.8738) likely signals the resumption of the primary downtrend and brings range support at 0.8670 \u2013 0.8690 into play. \n\nConversely, if 0.8730 successfully neutralizes selling pressure, a rebound back towards 0.8800 could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 61.08% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.57 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 2.66% higher than yesterday and 0.54% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 14.00% lower than yesterday and 24.87% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests EUR/GBP prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/GBP trading bias.\n\nGBP/NZD daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nThe GBP/NZD exchange rate\u2019s rebound from the January low seems set to endure in the near term, after price gapped back above the 100-MA and psychological resistance at 1.9200. \n\nThe development of the RSI and MACD are indicative of swelling bullish momentum, as both oscillators track firmly above their respective neutral midpoints. \n\nIf price remains constructively positioned above 1.9150, a push to challenge the sentiment-defining 200-day moving average (1.9378) looks on the cards. \n\nOn the other hand, a daily close below 1.9150 probably intensifies near-term selling pressure and carves a path to retest the monthly low (1.8861)\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "Chart Of The Day: EUR/USD May Have Started Ascent Towards 1.25", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "18 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD Vs USD/JPY and the FX Cross Pair Divide", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/rNkBPK9aa9Jmz49Ee7qjAg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/1bc8588b51831e795c1f03b377aa14d3", "auther": "Brian Twomey", "body": "Overall currency markets are in the great deadlock between natural opposites EUR/USD and USD/JPY.

The same similarities exist among all currency prices.\n\nThe Month highlighted by significant breaks and 5 and 10 year Averages\n\nJanuary 3 \u2013 8: AUD/USD: 5 year average 0.7306 Vs 0.7498 Vs 0.7821 or 323 pips\n\nJanuary 8: 0.7306 Vs 0.7530 Vs 0.7821 or 291 pips and a 32 pip compression to overall ranges.\n\nJanuary 14: 0.7306 Vs 0.7535 Vs 0.7821 or 286 pips and a 5 pip compression from last week and 37 pips overall in 3 weeks.\n\nJanuary 21 to 28: 0.7306 Vs 0.7535 and 0.7821 or no change.\n\nJanuary 28 to Feb 5: 0.7306, 0.7535 and 0.7821 and no change.\n\nFeb 5 to 14: 0.7306, 0.7531 and 0.7821 or no change.\n\nFeb 14 to 19: 0.7306, 0.7565 and 0.7821 or 256 pips and overall compression of 67 pips from January 3 to 8.\n\nBetween 0.7565 to 0.7821 are minor trade levels.\n\nClose Prices\n\nJanuary 9th, AUD/USD opened the week at 0.7765 then opened January 16th at 0.7700 or a 65 pip week.\n\nJanuary 16 to 23, AUD/USD opened at 0.7700 to close at 0.7710 for a 10 pip difference.\n\nJanuary 23rd to January 30 AUD opened at 0.7710 Vs close 0.7637 or 73 pips.\n\nJanuary 30 to Feb 5 Aud opened at 0.7637 and closed 0.7675 or 38 pips.\n\nFeb 5 to 14: 0.7675 to current 0.7759 or 84 pips.\n\nEUR/USD Ranges\n\nEUR/USD January 14 Significant MA\u2019s as follows: 1.2119, 1.2020, 1.2038 Vs 1.2630.\n\nFrom 1.2119 to 1.2630 = 511 pips.\n\nJanuary 8 to 14 : 1.2116, 1.2020, 1.2030 vs 1.2628.

The pair has spent most of the last eight or so hours consolidating in the upper 1.3900s as bulls catch their breath ahead of what they will hope is the next leg higher for the currency pair.\n\nOn the week, GBP is far and away now the best performing currency in the G10, up nearly 1.0% versus the US dollar. That compares to the euro, which is down 0.2% and JPY which is down 0.7%. On the month, it\u2019s a similar story, with GBP the best performer and up more than 2.0% versus the US dollar. AUD is not too far behind, up 1.75% versus the US dollar, and was the best performer on the month prior to Thursday\u2019s session. GBP\u2019s stellar performance compares to the euro, which is down 0.3% and JPY, which is down 0.9%.\n\nGBP continues to benefit from vaccine optimism-related tailwinds, with the country now having surpassed 16.4M vaccine doses delivered, up nearly 500K on the day. If the government can maintain this pace, all adults should have been offered their first vaccine by the government\u2019s target of the end of May.\n\nSterling bulls are also drawing hope from the continued sharp drop in Covid-19 infections, hospitalisations and deaths in the UK. The ongoing Imperial College of London study that tests tens of thousands of UK citizens every week to estimate the prevalence of the virus in the community shows that the number of currently infected persons has dropped by two-third since the start of January to around 0.5% of the population.\n\nIt remains unclear at this point as to how much of that is down to the lockdown and how much of that is down to the vaccines. Data from Israel, whose vaccination drive is well ahead of the UK\u2019s in terms of the percentage of the population who has been vaccinated, has been conclusive in showing that vaccines do cause infections to fall. Over the next two months, the government will be expecting to see infection rates drop disproportionately in vaccinated groups versus unvaccinated groups and confirmation that this is the case, alongside falling infection rates, will set the stage for reopening.\n\nAn early reopening timetable compared to many of its major developed market peers is likely to result in UK economic outperformance, as the \u201cpost-Covid-19\u201d recovery gets started early. UK consumers have built up a large buffer of savings over the past year amid closures in the service sector (i.e. hospitality and tourism) and expectations are for pent-up demand to be unleashed over the summer.\n\nIt is worth noting some downside risks to the above-outlined scenario, however; a survey by the Resolution Foundation, released on Wednesday, showed that about 2.6M UK workers, or 8% of the workforce, expect to lose their jobs in the next three months. The UK government can keep this number down and minimise the economic damage of such losses if it opts to extend its furlough job retention scheme. But if it opts to go down the more fiscally conservative route, job losses may be a drag on the post-Covid-19 recovery.\n\nUK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak will have some hard thinking to do ahead of the unveiling of his next budget on 3 March. Most analysts expect that given the high pressure on fiscal policymakers to over rather than under-deliver across the globe, Sunak will extend the scheme. Separately, Sunak is expected to announce an extension of the business rates holiday for the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors, which had been expected to end on 31 March.\n\nMeanwhile, latest reports from the FT suggest that Sunak is going to delay a review of business rates until the Autumn budget; the review is expected to make the case for a digital sales tax to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d between online and high street retailers.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Pound bulls to receive another boost as UK storms ahead with vaccines | Investing.com UK", "sentiment":

U.S. Dollar Index has managed to settle below the support at the 20 EMA at 90.60 and is trying to get below the next support level at 90.50. If this attempt is successful, the U.S. Dollar Index will head towards the next support level which is located at 90.30.\n\nToday, foreign exchange market traders will focus on the economic data from the UK. Analysts expect that Retail Sales declined by 2.5% month-over-month in January due to the negative impact of virus containment measures. On a year-over-year basis, Retail Sales are projected to decrease by 1.3%.\n\nTraders will aslo have a chance to take a look at flash PMI data for February. UK Manufacturing PMI is projected to decline from 54.1 in January to 53.2 in February while Services PMI is expected to increase from 39.5 to 41.\n\nEarlier, UK reported that Consumer Confidence increased from -28 in January to -23 in February. UK has one of the most successful mass vaccination programs in the world which boosts consumer mood and provides support to the British pound.\n\nGBP/USD managed to settle above the resistance at 1.3950 and is trying to settle above the next resistance level which is located at 1.3980. If this attempt is successful, GBP/USD will head towards the resistance at 1.4000.\n\nIn case GBP/USD gets above the resistance at 1.4000, it will gain additional upside momentum and move towards the resistance at 1.4025. A move above this level will open the way to the test of the resistance at 1.4050.\n\nOn the support side, the previous resistance at 1.3950 will serve as the first support level for GBP/USD. If GBP/USD declines below this level, it will head towards the next support at 1.3935. A successful test of this support level will push GBP/USD towards the support at 1.3915.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  U.S. Market Wrap and Forecast for Friday \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n-  18th February: BTC/USD Declines below 52,000, ETH/USD Comes Closer to 2,000 \n-  The Crypto Daily \u2013 Movers and Shakers \u2013 February 19th, 2021 \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Trader Reaction to .7764 Pivot Sets the Early Tone \n-  Is Ethereum About to Embark on a Large Correction Back to Around $1300? \n"}, {"headline": "GBP/USD Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Fly High", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "18 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Db7Ef.X8Bo2D.hdS1esqmw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/1f793efa0d817a98c023ed028c889e69", "auther": "Christopher Lewis", "body": "The British pound has rallied significantly during the course of the week, finally breaking above the 1.40 level a bit during the Friday session. This was probably mainly due to Gilts offering more yield as bond traders are starting to sell things off. This makes the British pound rather attractive, especially as there is more than a 1% differential between German Bunds and the Gilt markets. With that being the case, it makes money naturally flow towards the United Kingdom.\n\nAnother thing that you should pay attention to of course is the fact that the UK has inoculated more of a percentage of its population than most other countries. If that remains the focus, then it makes sense that people would believe that the British economy will pick up quicker than many of the other ones. Ultimately, I do think that this is a market that will try to go looking towards the next major resistance barrier on the weekly chart, in the form of the 1.42 handle. However, we are getting a bit overdone and a pullback is desperately needed.\n\nThe 1.3750 level will more than likely offer a lot of support as it was major resistance, but at this point we are essentially in \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d as we are halfway between a major support level and a major resistance level, which means that you are essentially gambling as to the next short term move.

This is a very bullish sign and could suggest that perhaps the market is trying to reach towards the 1.40 level above. That is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and therefore I think will attract a lot of attention. With that in mind, I do like the idea of waiting for a pullback still, because quite frankly you cannot chase these types of trades. The more parabolic a move is, the more dangerous the pullback becomes.\n\nAt this point, I would love to see a return to the 1.3750 level, or at least the 1.38 level. I do not know if we need to touch the 1.40 level before doing that, but clearly there will be a pullback sooner or later as we have gotten overstretched. The US dollar of course could have its say as we could get rising yields in the 10 year note again working against other currencies. I do not know that it will be felt as strongly here as it will and other currency pairs, but it should have some type of effect.\n\nTo the upside, if and when we can capture the 1.40 level, that should send the British pound looking towards 1.42 level based upon the longer-term charts. I am very interested in going long of this market, I just do not want to pay this price. Sometimes, patience is what will make more money than anything else.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  Silver Price Daily Forecast \u2013 Silver Retreats Despite Weaker Dollar \n-  SP 500 Price Forecast \u2013 Stock Markets Pull Back with Rising Yields \n-  Gold Price Forecast \u2013 Gold Markets Give up Early Gains \n-  Crude Oil Price Forecast \u2013 Crude Oil Markets Finally Showing Signs of Easing \n-  Stock Market Crash Warning \n-  Natural Gas Price Fundamental Daily Forecast \u2013 Demand to Ease Next Week but Cold Forecast to Return March 3 \n"}, {"headline": "February 19th 2021: Sterling Clocks Fresh 2021 Peaks Amid Dollar Losses", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/MrFSXItAqATlboO.VKoJUQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/e3ce12dc737f8ec0953da182fc00375f", "auther": "Aaron Hill", "body": "Note\u2014Charts provided by Trading View\n\nEUR/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe:\n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves)\n\nFebruary, as you can see, remains off session lows, though currently trades 0.4 percent lower.\n\nDownstream, 1.1857/1.1352 represents demand, while northbound shines light on ascending resistance (prior support \u2013 1.1641).\n\nIn terms of trend, the primary uptrend has been in play since price broke the 1.1714 high (Aug 2015) in July 2017.\n\nDaily timeframe:\n\nDemand from 1.1923/1.2001\u2014an area housing support at 1.1965 (previous Quasimodo resistance)\u2014remains an area of focus.\n\nRSI action remains gripping two converging RSI trendline resistances (yellow box), while circling the 50.00 centreline.\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nAs USD demand receded amid disappointing labour market, Europe\u2019s single currency benefitted on Thursday.\n\nThe one-sided move higher took over 1.2075 resistance, with price movement taking on resistance from 1.2087 in recent hours. Quasimodo resistance at 1.2149 is seen to the upside, with a break uncovering the 88.6% Fib level at 1.2162 and resistance from 1.2179.\n\nH1 timeframe:\n\nQuasimodo support at 1.2023, a level accompanied by a 127.2% Fib extension at 1.2029, has done a superb job in holding price higher.\n\nThursday\u2019s bullish impetus, as you can see, has landed candle action within a stone\u2019s throw from the 1.21 level and 100-period simple moving average. Moving through here could direct flow to resistance at 1.2132 (a previous Quasimodo support), stationed just south of 1.2150 resistance.\n\nRSI movement, as you can see, climbed above resistance around 54.20/47.05 and retested the upper edge of the base in recent moves, suggesting overbought conditions today.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nBased on current chart studies, 1.21 potentially offers fragile resistance. A H1 breakout above 1.21, therefore, could be interpreted as a bullish cue, targeting H1 resistance at 1.2132, followed by 1.2050 (aligns with H4 Quasimodo resistance at 1.2149).\n\nAUD/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe:\n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves)\n\nJanuary\u2019s half-hearted shooting star candle (often construed as a bearish indication at peaks) has so far failed to seduce sellers. February, as you can see, trades a touch off session highs, up by about 1.7 percent.\n\nThis brings light to 0.8303/0.8082\u2014a supply zone aligning closely with trendline resistance (prior support \u2013 0.4776). In the event sellers regain consciousness, however, long-term demand resides at 0.7029/0.6664 (prior supply).\n\nIn the context of trend (despite the trendline resistance [1.0582] breach in July 2020), the primary downtrend (since mid-2011) remains in play until breaking 0.8135 (January high [2018]).\n\nDaily timeframe:\n\nPartly modified from previous analysis \u2013\n\nAUD/USD bulls modestly stepped forward on Thursday, snapping a two-day bearish phase.\n\nUpriver, beyond 2021 pinnacles at 0.7820, supply inhabits the 0.7937/0.7890 neighbourhood. Calling for attention to the downside, on the other hand, is trendline support, an ascending level drawn from the low 0.5506.\n\nRSI flow remains flirting with trendline resistance. A downside move here has the 50.00 centreline in sight, while moves north could have the value invade overbought space.\n\nH4 timeframe: \n\nCurrent flow is seen fluctuating between resistance parked at 0.7769 and drop-base-rally demand at around the 0.7727ish region (green).\n\nOutside of this range, support at 0.7698 can be found, a previous Quasimodo resistance, while a bullish play may target resistance drawn from 0.7805.\n\nH1 timeframe: \n\nH4 resistance mentioned above at 0.7769 recently made an entrance, following an earlier push off session troughs, movement that took on 0.7750 resistance and the 100-period simple moving average. A H1 close north of 0.7771 could spark a bullish theme to 0.78, despite a nearby Quasimodo resistance plotted at 0.7782.\n\nRSI followers may also note the value climbed the 50.00 centreline, implying upside momentum is to the upside and could continue to overbought territory.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nMonthly and daily timeframes displaying scope to attack higher levels places a question mark on H4 resistance from 0.7769. A H1 close above the latter could have breakout buyers make a show, with 0.78 (H1) targeted, set just south of H4 resistance at 0.7805.\n\nUSD/JPY:\n\nMonthly timeframe: \n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves) \n\nBuyers are beginning to show life on the monthly scale, following January\u2019s bullish engulfing candle.\n\nUp by 1 percent, descending resistance (not considered traditional trendline resistance) takes the spotlight to the upside, etched from the high 118.66, whereas support inhabits 101.70.\n\nDaily timeframe: \n\nPartly modified from previous analysis \u2013\n\nThursday extended Wednesday\u2019s retracement out of supply from 106.33/105.78, consequently throwing light on the nearby 200-day simple moving average at 105.51.\n\nThe RSI indicator recently produced bearish divergence off overbought territory. Support remains on the table around 57.00.\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nPartly modified from previous analysis \u2013\n\nThe October 7 (2020) peak at 106.11 made a show Wednesday and, as you can see, stimulated a bearish response that extended into Thursday\u2019s session.\n\nDemand remains in sight at 105.26/105.41 and 105.26/105.14 (commonly referred to as stacked demand), while should buyers eventually overthrow 106.11, a 127.2% Fib projection at 106.44 is in view, shadowed by Quasimodo resistance at 106.58.\n\nH1 timeframe:\n\nTechnical framework on the H1 scale shows price grinding towards the 100-period simple moving average at 105.61, with a break shining light on a neighbouring trendline support, taken from the low 104.41.\n\nUpside, we can see the 106 figure, shadowed by two nearby Quasimodo resistances at 106.09 and 106.27.\n\nRSI fans will note the value is circling a 50.00 support area.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nLargely unchanged outlook.\n\nThe reaction from daily supply at 106.33/105.78 might tempt sellers to extend the unit lower and retest the 200-day simple moving average around 105.51. Given the monthly timeframe\u2019s bullish position right now (see above), a dip to the SMA could spark a bullish theme. Note the SMA also coincides closely with H4 demand at 105.26/105.41 and H1 trendline support.\n\nGBP/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe: \n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves) \n\nFollowing December\u2019s 2.5 percent advance\u2014movement that stirred major trendline resistance (2.1161)\u2014February has refreshed multi-month highs at 1.3985.\n\nIn terms of trend structure, however, the primary trend has faced lower since early 2008, unbroken (as of current price) until 1.4376 gives way\u2014April high, 2018. In effect, the aforesaid high represents the next upside objective on the monthly chart.\n\nDaily timeframe: \n\nSterling nudged higher against the dollar Thursday amidst successful COVID-19 vaccinations across the UK. As you can see, this placed supply at 1.3996/1.3918 under pressure.\n\nNorth of supply we can see we have resistance parked at 1.4011, a previous Quasimodo support base (red).\n\nRSI action remains teasing the upper edge of a 3-month range between support around 47.00 and resistance at the 66.00 region, testing overbought territory.\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nFor those who read previous analysis you may recall the following (italics):\n\nEarly hours Tuesday witnessed price movement puncture the upper side of supply from 1.3942/1.3900 (glued to the lower side of daily supply at 1.3996/1.3918). With many price action traders likely to view this as a bullish cue (sellers consumed at supply), dip-buying could emerge off support from 1.3852. \n\nAs evident from the chart, 1.3852 served well as support and has indeed taken on supply from 1.3942/1.3900, which has brought light to another supply at 1.4034/1.3989 (fastened to the upper side of daily supply mentioned above at 1.3996/1.3918 which also houses daily resistance at 1.4011).\n\nH1 timeframe: \n\nUpside gained speed heading into London hours on Thursday, overriding the 100-period simple moving average, the 1.39 figure and 1.3951 tops.\n\nUltimately, what this has done is throw the key figure 1.40 into the realms of possibility, a psychological barrier aligning with a 100% Fib extension at 1.4022 and a 127.2% Fib projection from 1.3996. Therefore, this is likely to be on the radar for many GBP/USD traders today.\n\nRSI flow has recently exited overbought territory, following a peak at 79.87.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nThe 1.40 figure on the H1 and associated Fib levels is likely to not only interest sellers, but it may also be a logical upside target for longs. Also of interest is 1.40 unites closely with daily resistance at 1.4011 and H4 supply parked at 1.4034/1.3989.\n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nThe information contained in this material is intended for general advice only.

EUR/USD is categorized in the class of a risk asset and non USD currency.\n\nEUR/USD\u2019s early break to its 5 year average set remainder 27 currencies on a course of deep perspective as non USD currency pairs had to not only match EUR/USD\u2019s break to significant averages but the 1000 pip rise in GBP/USD, 700 for AUD/USD and other non USD currency pairs traded weekly from overbought to overbought and a non normal price circumstance. EUR/USD\u2019s break threw normal price markets deeply off course since August 2020.\n\nNon USD currency pairs such as DXY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY only option since August 2020 was to concur with EUR/USD and non USD rises by trading deeply oversold week to week and to break 5 and 10 year averages.\n\nEUR/USD and non USD currency pairs as risk assets followed risk asset counterparts in stock markets higher to current richter scale overbought levels. The S&P\u2019s at 3900.00\u2019s trade at extreme overbought levels. The DAX achieved all time highs. Stock market longs are virtually impossible until a significant correction occurs.\n\nDXY\n\nDXY for example just broke above its 10 year monthly average at 89.95 and contains a long way to travel to the 5 year average at 95.00\u2019s. A currency pair to trade at a 10 year monthly average is not only a low, low price but extraordinary and highlights the magnitude to the rises and falls since last August.\n\nNext averages above to break are located at 91.43, 92.78 then 94.39 and 94.16. DXY from monthly averages 1 to 7 years faces stiff resistance from 94.00\u2019s to 95.00\u2019s. A break through this brick wall then DXY will travel easily to 97.00\u2019s and 99.00\u2019s.\n\nDXY below 89.95 targets 86.43, 84.32 and 81.83 at extreme oversold.\n\nTargets for DXY above 89.95 are located at 90.86, above 91.43 then 92.15, 92.47 and 92.66. Above 92.78 targets 92.87 and 92.89.\n\nDXY from current ranges from 89.95 to 92.78 trade at its widest ranges. As DXY travels higher then ranges severely compress. The opposite is true for EUR/USD as the higher it trades then ranges open much wider.\n\nDespite a low price and trade below monthly 5 year averages, DXY is mid range to oversold/ overbought.\n\nS&P\u2019s\n\nDXY viewed from the S&P\u2019s informs trade location miles above the 5 year monthly average at 2722.43 and at overbought to extremes. Overbought S&P\u2019s reveals a healthy correction is on the way, DXY higher and EUR/USD as well as non USD currency pairs to follow much lower.\n\nThe S&P\u2019s are held by immediate averages at 3257.68, 3119.54 and 2989.17. A correction targets 3598.53, 3416.84 and 3300.20. A 400 point correction to the S&P\u2019s assumes DXY travels 300 ish pips higher and breaks above 92.78 to trade between 92.78 to 94.39.\n\nS&P averages from 3257.68 travels every 100 points to 2200.00\u2019s at the 10 year monthly average. Current S&P\u2019s ranges are fairly suppressed however as S&P\u2019s drop then ranges expand as the downside gains progresses.\n\nGOLD\n\nGold trades above its 5 year monthly average at 1461.20 and trades misaligned to the S&P\u2019s. Gold and the DXY are the same assets and should trade below 5 year monthly averages while the S&P\u2019s trade above.\n\nGold\u2019s drop is held by 1815.65 and below targets 1642.17 and 1543.98. Gold is deeply overbought from a medium and long term perspective. Gold is finished above at 1943.62 and short is the only trade available.\n\nMoving forward, long USD and DXY is the best option while short Gold and the S&P\u2019s although Gold lacks any real range capability. Gold viewed from 150 to 200 points is a viable option as it fails to contain any big price moves.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  Bitcoin and Ripple\u2019s XRP \u2013 Weekly Technical Analysis \u2013 February 15th, 2021 \n-  DXY V S&P Feb 14 2021 \n-  Oil Price Fundamental Daily Forecast \u2013 Higher as Stimulus Hopes, Tighter Supplies Offset Worries Over Demand \n-  The Crypto Daily \u2013 Movers and Shakers \u2013 February 14th, 2021 \n-  Cannabis, Alternative Agra, Mushrooms, and Cryptos \u2013 All ALTs are HOT \n-  Natural Gas Price Fundamental Daily Forecast \u2013 Futures Capped by Stubborn Short-Sellers While Spot Prices Soar \n"}, {"headline": "February 17th 2021: Yields Surge to Fresh 2021 Peaks; DXY Forms Daily Bullish Engulfing Candle", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/1sxCJomevWrWN6V45w2QzA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/c8e2bd98e233c31f68906e0191e91a0f", "auther": "Aaron Hill", "body": "Note\u2014Charts provided by Trading View\n\nEUR/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe:\n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves)\n\nFebruary has so far witnessed a healthy floor of bids emerge around the 1.1950 neighbourhood, consequently stirring a hammer formation (though we will not know this until the month concludes).\n\nDownstream, 1.1857/1.1352 represents demand, while northbound shines light on ascending resistance (prior support \u2013 1.1641).\n\nIn terms of trend, the primary uptrend has been in play since price broke the 1.1714 high (Aug 2015) in July 2017.\n\nDaily timeframe:\n\nPartly modified from previous analysis \u2013\n\nAlbeit off best levels, Tuesday concluded another session mostly unmoved around 1.2130.\n\nDemand at 1.1923/1.2001\u2014an area housing support at 1.1965 (previous Quasimodo resistance)\u2014offers a logical downside target should sellers regain consciousness.\n\n1.2190 tops, shadowed by Quasimodo resistance from 1.2278, are seen as possible upside targets.\n\nRSI fans will note the value remains engaging with the 50.00 centreline, which happens to share space with two converging trendline resistances (yellow box).\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nAreas to monitor on the H4 chart are the 88.6% Fib level at 1.2162, closely stationed by resistance from 1.2179.\n\nTo the downside, swing support is recognised at 1.2087, followed by 1.2075 support (joined by a 50.0% level at 1.2060).\n\nH1 timeframe:\n\nUSD bulls went on the offensive Tuesday, prompting bearish bets on EUR/USD following a whipsaw through 1.2150 resistance (a move commonly referred to as a stop run or a bull trap). In one fell swoop, we punched back through the 100-period simple moving average and shook hands with 1.21, which, as you can see, has served well as support during US trading.\n\nDownstream, aside from H4 support priced at 1.2087, H1 demand resides close by at 1.2078/1.2062.\n\nOut of the RSI oscillator, the value bottomed north of oversold terrain and is on course to cross swords with the lower side of a resistance zone between 47.05 and 54.20.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nOutlook mostly unchanged due to lacklustre performance \u2013 \n\nMonthly price continues to express interest in higher levels, which may eventually motivate daily buyers.\n\nA short-term support zone forged on the H1 timeframe (green) between the upper side of demand at 1.2078 and the 1.21 figure (between the area, H4 support is plotted at 1.2087), therefore, could attract a bullish scenario today and take the currency pair north of the 100-period simple moving average.\n\nAUD/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe:\n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves)\n\nJanuary\u2019s half-hearted shooting star candle (often construed as a bearish indication at peaks) has so far failed to seduce sellers. February, as you can see, trades a touch off session highs, up by about 1.6 percent.\n\nThis brings light to 0.8303/0.8082\u2014a supply zone aligning closely with trendline resistance (prior support \u2013 0.4776). In the event sellers regain consciousness, however, long-term demand resides at 0.7029/0.6664 (prior supply).\n\nIn the context of trend (despite the trendline resistance [1.0582] breach in July 2020), the primary downtrend (since mid-2011) remains in play until breaking 0.8135 (January high [2018]).\n\nDaily timeframe:\n\nThe Australian dollar found itself under pressure against a broadly stronger US dollar (DXY > 90.50) on Tuesday, establishing what many candlestick enthusiasts refer to as a bearish outside reversal.\n\nUpriver, beyond 2021 pinnacles at 0.7820, supply inhabits the 0.7937/0.7890 neighbourhood. Calling for attention to the downside, on the other hand, is trendline support, an ascending level drawn from the low 0.5506.\n\nRSI flow is seen touching gloves with RSI trendline resistance. A downside move here has the 50.00 centreline in sight, while moves north could have the value invade overbought space.\n\nH4 timeframe: \n\nResistance at 0.7805 made an entrance in the early hours of trade on Tuesday, ultimately guiding price action through support at 0.7769.\n\nAs evident from the chart, 0.7769 currently serves as resistance and could ultimately lead things back towards support at 0.7698, a previous Quasimodo resistance. Note, however, that a bullish defence could also emerge around the 0.7727ish region (green \u2013 a drop-base-rally demand zone).\n\nH1 timeframe: \n\nTuesday\u2019s depreciation directed intraday flow south of 0.78 on Tuesday, movement that tested the mettle of 0.7750 support and a nearby 100-period simple moving average.\n\nWith RSI flow dipping through a relatively long-standing trendline support, taken from the low 23.72, and space for sellers to stretch their legs south of 0.7750 to at least Quasimodo support from 0.7719 (followed by 0.77), a short-term bearish scene could emerge sub 0.7750.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nShort term, a H1 close below 0.7750 is likely to stir a bearish theme towards 0.77 on the H1 (H1 Quasimodo support is potentially fragile having seen the level tested last Friday).\n\nLonger term, the monthly chart shows buyers are likely to eventually take the wheel, though prior to this, daily action could retreat and retest trendline support, perhaps inspiring a wave of dip-buying.\n\nUSD/JPY:\n\nMonthly timeframe: \n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves) \n\nBuyers are beginning to show life on the monthly scale, following January\u2019s bullish engulfing candle.\n\nUp by 1.3 percent, resistance can be seen in the form of a descending line (not considered traditional trendline resistance), etched from the high 118.66, whereas support continues to inhabit 101.70 in the event sellers make a show.\n\nDaily timeframe: \n\nNotably, price action on the daily chart made its way above the 200-day simple moving average at 105.53 yesterday, registering a fifth successive daily advance and testing the walls of supply coming in from 106.33/105.78.\n\nBreaking north of a 200-day simple moving average is generally interpreted as a bullish indication, a move that may tempt buyers to take on the aforementioned supply and reach for another layer of supply arranged at 107.58/106.85.\n\nThe RSI indicator is seen edging its way back into overbought territory and also possibly bringing bearish divergence to the table.\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nIn line with the US dollar index staging a strong bullish show and the 10-year US Treasury yield puncturing 1.30 percent, USD/JPY bulls pressed higher from demand at 105.26/105.14 (previous supply).\n\nThe October 7 (2020) peak at 106.11 is next on tap, in terms of resistance, with a break unmasking a 127.2% Fib projection at 106.44, shadowed by Quasimodo resistance at 106.58.\n\nH1 timeframe:\n\nRecent bullish flow, as you can see on the H1 chart, saw the unit topple a number of resistances, including psychological resistance at 106.\n\nAssuming buyers maintain a bullish presence above 106, this could stir interest to Quasimodo resistance at 106.27.\n\nThe RSI indicator, as you might expect in view of the upside movement since last week, continues to explore overbought territory. Notice that support also formed around the 44.00ish range, a common scenario in a rising market.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nWith H1 visibly retesting 106 as support, following an earlier breach, this suggests H4 may attempt to overthrow the October 7 (2020) peak at 106.11. Fuelled on the back of monthly price striving for higher levels, this could have intraday flow draw towards Quasimodo resistance at 106.27 on the H1, followed by the H4 127.2% Fib projection at 106.44.\n\nGBP/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe: \n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves) \n\nFollowing December\u2019s 2.5 percent advance\u2014movement that stirred major trendline resistance (2.1161)\u2014February has refreshed multi-month highs at 1.3951.\n\nIn terms of trend structure, however, the primary trend has faced lower since early 2008, unbroken (as of current price) until 1.4376 gives way\u2014April high, 2018. In effect, the aforesaid high represents the next upside objective on the monthly chart.\n\nDaily timeframe: \n\nDespite refreshing 2021 highs on Tuesday, GBP/USD remains testing the spirit of supply at 1.3996/1.3918. Candlestick traders will also note yesterday\u2019s action forged an indecision candle, which could, given the market trending higher since 2020, be interpreted as a bearish cue. Essentially, though, buyers and sellers are in a standoff.\n\nSupport on the daily scale can be seen at 1.3755.\n\nRSI action recently broke above the upper edge of a 3-month range between support around 47.00 and resistance at the 66.00 region (the value stands at 67.67), and is on the verge of entering overbought territory.\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nEarly hours Tuesday witnessed price movement puncture the upper side of supply from 1.3942/1.3900 (glued to the lower side of daily supply at 1.3996/1.3918). With many price action traders likely to view this as a bullish cue (sellers consumed at supply), dip-buying could emerge off support from 1.3852.\n\nIt should also be noted that a dip below 1.3852 could send price back to demand at 1.3761/1.3789.\n\nH1 timeframe: \n\nTechnical studies derived from the H1 chart reveal price action tracking ground south of the 1.39 figure, which could see the pair embrace trendline support, taken from the low 1.3566, fixed together with a nearby 100-period simple moving average.\n\nA test of the aforesaid trendline support, however, could also bring about a whipsaw to neighbouring support at 1.3850.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nThe monthly timeframe eyeing 1.4376, in addition to H4 price recently testing the upper edge of supply at 1.3942/1.3900, potentially shines the technical spotlight on H1 trendline support as a possible platform buyers may be attracted to.\n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nThe information contained in this material is intended for general advice only.

Measured by the US dollar index, the buck shed 0.7 percent, following a bearish outside reversal formed on February 5 from a 127.2% Fib projection at 91.44.\n\nFriday settling considerably off best levels, together with the RSI oscillator burrowing through channel support and the 50.00 centreline, places the 90.04 trough (January 21) in sight. Violating the aforesaid level this week shines the technical spotlight on support drawn from 89.34.\n\nIn addition to last week\u2019s retreat, the US dollar has echoed a downside bias since topping south of the 103.00 figure in early March 2020. Consequently, January\u2019s pullback and the recent decline may be interpreted as a bearish cue. Submerging support at 89.34 and the 88.25 February 16 low (2018) is likely to further confirm the current bearish narrative.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, therefore, the 90.00 figure might be worth keeping a tab on this week, with a break perhaps calling for support at 89.34.\n\nEUR/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe:\n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves)\n\nFebruary has witnessed a healthy floor of bids emerge around the 1.1950 neighbourhood, consequently stirring a hammer formation (though we will not know this until the month concludes).\n\nDownstream, 1.1857/1.1352 represents demand, while northbound shines light on ascending resistance (prior support \u2013 1.1641).\n\nIn terms of trend, the primary uptrend has been in play since price broke the 1.1714 high (Aug 2015) in July 2017.\n\nDaily timeframe:\n\nUp by 0.6 percent, EUR/USD bulls wrapped up the week on the front foot. Earlier action witnessed the pair extend recovery gains north of demand at 1.1923/1.2001\u2014an area housing support at 1.1965 (previous Quasimodo resistance).\n\nAs you can see, Friday settled off worst levels (shaped by way of a hammer candle pattern), suggesting bulls could grow in confidence this week and approach 1.2190 tops, shadowed by Quasimodo resistance from 1.2278.\n\nRSI fans will note the value ended the week engaging with the 50.00 centreline, which happens to share space with two converging trendline resistances (yellow box).\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nQuasimodo resistance at 1.2142\u2014aligning with a 78.6% Fib level at 1.2138 and a 50.0% retracement at 1.2149\u2014remains centre of attention on the H4 scale, withstanding two upside attempts last week. Space north of here may call for resistance at 1.2179, with subsequent buying to possibly take aim at another resistance plotted at 1.2214.\n\nAs you can see, Friday also discovered a healthy pocket of bids from swing support recognised at 1.2087, leaving 1.2075 support unchallenged.\n\nH1 timeframe:\n\nMid-way through London Friday observed buyers attempt to arrange a defence off 1.21 psychological support, with price movement even establishing a hammer candle pattern\u2014a formation generally viewed as a bullish signal. However, heading into US hours, the majority of buyers were squeezed out of the market as the pair whipsawed to lows ahead of demand at 1.2078/1.2062. This has stop-run written all over it.\n\nQuasimodo resistance at 1.2142 noted on the H4 scale remains a prominent fixture on the H1 timeframe. Taking on higher levels this week may see buyers push beyond what appears to be a consumed H1 Quasimodo resistance at 1.2173 to pursue 1.22 resistance.\n\n47.05/54.20 continues to serve as support and resistance out of the RSI indicator, an area in play since the beginning of February.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nLong term:\n\nBoth monthly and daily timeframes ended last week off worst levels, in the shape of a hammer pattern\u2014movement often interpreted as a bullish cue.\n\nBy the same token, both charts demonstrate room to scale higher this week, targeting 1.2190 tops on the daily chart.\n\nShort term:\n\nH4 Quasimodo resistance at 1.2142, despite blending closely with Fib studies, has failed to invite selling beneath local H4 support at 1.2087. The non-committal tone from sellers, along with H1 reclaiming 1.21+ status Friday, places a question mark on the H4 Quasimodo formation.\n\nAccording to chart studies, therefore, this week favours buyers until around the 1.22 neighbourhood.\n\nAUD/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe:\n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves)\n\nJanuary\u2019s half-hearted shooting star candle (often construed as a bearish indication at peaks) has so far failed to seduce sellers. February, as you can see, trades a touch off session highs, up by about 1.6 percent.\n\nThis brings light to 0.8303/0.8082\u2014a supply zone aligning closely with trendline resistance (prior support \u2013 0.4776). In the event sellers regain consciousness, however, long-term demand resides at 0.7029/0.6664 (prior supply).\n\nIn the context of trend (despite the trendline resistance [1.0582] breach in July 2020), the primary downtrend (since mid-2011) remains in play until breaking 0.8135 (January high [2018]).\n\nDaily timeframe:\n\nAmid renewed USD softness, AUD/USD bulls remained on the offensive heading into the latter part of last week. Northbound, 0.7782 tops are in sight this week, along with the 2021 peak at 0.7820, whereas sellers regaining consciousness could lead trendline support back into the fight, an ascending level drawn from the low 0.5506.\n\nRSI flow dethroned the 50.00 centreline and landed the indicator at RSI trendline resistance, with further upside to possibly touch overbought space.\n\nH4 timeframe: \n\nBearish bets from supply at 0.7769/0.7749 appear somewhat restrained right now, implying a move to resistance at 0.7805 could be in the offing.\n\nIn case sellers make an entrance, nonetheless, support at 0.7698 might call for attention.\n\nH1 timeframe: \n\nWith the help of the 100-period simple moving average around 0.7726 and Quasimodo support at 0.7719, Friday gathered traction and dethroned 0.7750 resistance.\n\nNorth of Thursday\u2019s peak at 0.7771, Quasimodo resistance at 0.7777 resides nearby as a possible upside objective this week, with a break uncovering 0.78 psychological resistance.\n\nInterestingly, movement out of the RSI indicator also shows the value rebounded off familiar trendline support Friday and clawed above the 50.00 centreline to highlight a possible move into overbought space.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nLong term:\n\nThe monthly could call for higher levels over the coming weeks, which may lend buyers support on the daily scale and have the pair refresh 2021 highs this week, with daily supply at 0.7937/0.7890 also to possibly make an entrance.\n\nShort term:\n\nWith higher timeframes poised to pursue upside, and H4 supply at 0.7769/0.7749 displaying signs of vulnerability, H1 buyers may take this as a bullish sign and hold north of 0.7750 to take on H1 Quasimodo resistance at 0.7777 and 0.78 (which aligns with the 0.7805 resistance on the H4).\n\nUSD/JPY:\n\nMonthly timeframe: \n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves) \n\nSince January snapped a four-month bearish phase in the shape of a bullish engulfing candle, buyers have since struggled to find acceptance at higher levels. Consequent to this, February currently trades off best levels.\n\nResistance can be seen in the form of a descending line (not considered traditional trendline resistance), etched from the high 118.66, whereas follow-through weakness shifts focus to support at 101.70.\n\nDaily timeframe: \n\nTechnical structure to be mindful of this week is the 200-day simple moving average at 105.54 and supply coming in from 106.33/105.78. While lower on the curve, trendline resistance-turned support, pencilled in from the high 111.71, could make a show. Demand at 103.56/103.93 is also seen close by.\n\nThe RSI indicator ended the week engaging with 57.00 support (previous resistance).\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nThe 38.2% Fib level taken from 104.50\u2014a level representing the initial take-profit objective from the alternate AB=CD resistance at 105.63 (the 127.2% Fib extension)\u2014provided a platform for buyers to work with last week.\n\nFriday, however, witnessed supply at 105.26/105.14 make an entrance, a clear-cut drop-base-drop formation that boasts healthy downside momentum from its base. Technically speaking, a break of the aforesaid supply this week could swing the pendulum in favour of retesting AB=CD resistance, whereas a punch lower could draw in not only the 38.2% Fib, but also trendline support (102.59).\n\nH1 timeframe:\n\nIn addition to supply underlined above on the H4 scale at 105.26/105.14, H1 resistance made up between 105.14, 105.08 (50.0% retracement) and the 105 figure stepped forward during the early hours of London on Friday.\n\nSellers making a show from 105.14/105.00 underlines demand at 104.78/104.89, with a breach underscoring 104.50 support. This demand is considered reasonably important, given it was here a decision was made to break above 105 resistance.\n\nThe RSI indicator shows the value finished the week within shouting distance of 50.00, following moves out of overbought space.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nLong term:\n\nThe lack of buying following the monthly timeframe\u2019s bullish engulfing candle, together with room to push south on the daily timeframe to demand at 103.56/103.93, places sellers at the wheel this week, technically speaking.\n\nShort term:\n\nIn line with the higher timeframe picture, H4 supply at 105.26/105.14 could interest sellers this week. A H1 close under demand at 104.78/104.89, therefore, could fuel a short-term bearish theme to 104.50 support.\n\nGBP/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe: \n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves) \n\nFollowing December\u2019s 2.5 percent advance\u2014movement that stirred major trendline resistance (2.1161)\u2014February has so far refreshed multi-month highs at 1.3866.\n\nIn terms of trend structure, however, the primary trend has faced lower since early 2008, unbroken (as of current price) until 1.4376 gives way\u2014April high, 2018. In effect, the aforesaid high represents the next upside objective on the monthly chart.\n\nDaily timeframe: \n\nPartly modified from previous analysis \u2013\n\nIn the shape of a bullish outside reversal, Friday witnessed buyers strengthen their grip north of support at 1.3755, following two back-to-back shooting star candle patterns\u2014structure generally interpreted as a bearish signal. Bouncing higher this week throws light on supply at 1.3996/1.3918.\n\nThe RSI indicator remains circling the upper edge of a 3-month range between support around 47.00 and resistance at the 66.00 region (the value stands at 65.49). It is common to see higher oversold support areas form in an uptrend.\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nDemand at 1.3761/1.3789 welcomed price action on Friday, movement which motivated a bullish wave back to resistance at 1.3852, a previous Quasimodo support. Rupturing the aforementioned level this week shines the headlights on supply at 1.3942/1.3900 (glued to the lower side of daily supply at 1.3996/1.3918).\n\nH1 timeframe: \n\nReinforcing H4 resistance at 1.3852, we have a modest H1 Fib cluster (resistance) around 1.3850 (made up of a 161.8% Fib projection at 1.3850 and a 100% Fib extension at 1.3855), joined together with RSI trendline resistance making a show just ahead of overbought terrain.\n\nDownside targets fall in around the 100-period simple moving average at 1.3810 and the 1.38 figure; a nudge through 1.3845, however, could see price bump heads with the 1.39 figure.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nLong term:\n\nAlong with daily buyers making a stand on Friday and highlighting supply at 1.3996/1.3918 as a possible upside target, monthly price remains optimistic above trendline resistance.\n\nShort term:\n\nDaily price exhibiting scope to advance this week places a question mark on H4 resistance at 1.3852 and, by extension, the H1 Fib cluster around 1.3850. This could prompt a bullish breakout scenario north of 1.3850 this week, targeting 1.39 on the H1 (aligns with the underside of H4 supply at 1.3942/1.3900, which itself is glued to the lower side of daily supply at 1.3996/1.3918).\n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nThe information contained in this material is intended for general advice only.

Sterling remained strong despite weak retail sales numbers for January.\n\nAt 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.483, after a 0.4% decline overnight cut short a two-day winning streak.\n\nEUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2107, USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 105.62, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.4% to 0.7793.\n\nThe dollar had posted gains over the last couple of days as U.S. Treasury yields had risen with the release of strong retail sales data, but the unexpected rise in the number of jobless claims came as a reminder of how much slack the pandemic has left in the labor market.\n\nA total of 861,000 claims were filed during the previous week, hitting a four-week high, compared with the 765,000 claims expected and the 848,000 claims filed during the previous week.\n\nThe Federal Reserve had already warned, in the minutes from its January policy meeting, that the labor market would take time to return to trend and thus its easy monetary policy would stay in place for a considerable period.\n\nAnd Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made it clear that $1.9 trillion in pandemic-relief spending is still needed, defending the need for President Joe Biden\u2019s plan despite the recent strength in retail sales.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to have a big package that addresses the pain this has caused,\u201d Yellen said on CNBC Thursday. \u201cThe price of doing too little is much larger than the price of doing something big.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, GBP/USD traded up 0.1% at 1.3979, with sterling retaining its recent strength despite the release of very weak economic data Friday. British retail sales fell 8.2% in January on the month, a much sharper fall than expected as non-essential shops went back into coronavirus lockdowns.\n\nThe pound traded near an almost three-year high overnight, helped by perceptions that Britain's aggressive vaccination program will result in the country coming out of lockdown more quickly than its neighbors. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to lay out the country's roadmap for exiting lockdowns on Monday.\n\nAdditionally, U.K. government borrowing climbed to 270.6 billion pounds ($378 billion) in the first 10 months of the fiscal year, as the pandemic played havoc with public finances. Britain is facing its largest deficit in peacetime, while its public debt is now over 100% of GDP\n\n\u201cAll of this suggests that the path of least resistance for GBP/USD in the near term should be lower,\u201d said Kathy Lien, analyst at BK Asset Management, as cable nears the 1.40 level.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDollar nurses losses after jobs data mars recovery narrative; sterling

"auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "NZD/USD has been firmly on the front foot since the start of Friday\u2019s European trading session, rallying from Asia Pacific levels of just above the 0.7200 mark to now above 0.7300. The pair is thus within striking distance of the 2021 high set right at the start of January of just shy of the 0.7320 level. With gains of roughly 1.2% versus this US dollar, Friday is shaping up to be the kiwi\u2019s best since 9 October 2020.\n\nOn the week, the currency is now\u00a0vying for first place in the G10 ranking with GBP and AUD, all trading with weekly gains versus the US dollar of between 1.2-1.4%. On the month, NZD is the third-best performer after GBP and AUD, up about 2% versus USD.\n\nThe kiwi currently sits atop the G10 FX performance table, though specific news or events can be definitively pointed at as supporting the currency. For what its worth, Q4 PPI data released during Friday\u2019s Asia Pacific session did not appear to influence the price action much; input prices were unchanged in the quarter, down from growth of 0.6% in Q3, whilst Output price growth accelerated to 0.4% from its -0.3% contraction in Q3.\n\nMarkets have been in a generally risk-on mood on Friday and this is supporting risk-sensitive currencies such as NZD; stock markets are yet to take the recent run higher in global bond yields as a negative and the S&P 500 continues to trade comfortably above the 3900 level, not far from recent record levels. US President Joe Biden is expected to say that the US is not looking for a new cold war with China at the G7 summit, constructive commentary that may ease some concerns about the potential for relations to further deteriorate. Biden is still expected to call for democracies to challenge the country\u2019s abusive practises, however. Meanwhile, preliminary Markit PMI data for February out of Australia, the UK and US were decent, implying that the recovery in these countries remains on track as global vaccine rollouts continue. On which note, vaccine appears to lower Covid-19 infections and transmission rates by two-thirds, according to the Telegraph citing data set to be released later this month by Public Health England.\n\nWhilst the above is all very well and good for the kiwi, support also appears to be coming from movements in Australia and New Zealand\u2019s bond markets; yields in the former have surged since the start of the European session, with Australian 10-year bond yields currently up more than 7bps on the day at close to 1.49% following a change to Westpac\u2019s year-end bond yield forecast (which was revised higher to 1.9% from 1.5%. When New Zealand\u2019s bond markets re-open on Monday, similar upside is likely to be seen in bond yields there. That means the country\u2019s 10-year yield could be substantially higher than its Friday closing level at 1.517%, which was already amongst the highest yielding developed market 10-year notes.\n\nNZD/USD four hour chart\n\n\n"}, {"headline": "NZD/USD supported at 50DMA but unable to reclaim 0.7200 amid strong US dollar conditions", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/CRUxykgppI_mScxuvnXDbw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/b35f313e6320bd18a1f906d91a337833", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "NZD/USD has recovered from a brief dip below its 50-day moving average at 0.7165, with the pair now trading in the 0.7170s. The currency pair lost its grip on the 0.7200 level during Asia Pacific trade and has since fallen back to over one-week lows. At present, the pair is 0.5% or about 40 pips lower on the day.\n\nNZD has been unable to garner any impetus from the fact that the New Zealand government authorities are set to lift a three-day snap lockdown in Auckland, given their confidence that a mini Covid-19 outbreak reported there over the weekend has been brought under control. Looking ahead for the kiwi, Producer Price Inflation data for the final quarter of last year is set to be released at 21:45GMT on Thursday and will be scrutinised for any signs of rising inflation that might concern the RBNZ.\n\nUSD traders, meanwhile, will be keeping a close eye on the release of the minutes from the FOMC\u2019s January monetary policy meeting at 19:00GMT. The minutes are expected to show that a majority of Fed members remain opposed to the idea of tapering the bank\u2019s asset purchase programme any time soon.\n\nIn terms of the price action on Wednesday; NZD/USD has been taking its cue mostly from the US dollar side of the equation on Wednesday. The US dollar has shrugged off a minor retracement in US bond yields (the US 10-year has dropped back to below 1.28% from session highs above 1.32%, down around 2bps on the day). Note that a steep rise in US bond yields on Tuesday supported the buck. The US dollar is also benefitting from a string of very strong US data releases\u2026\n\nStarting with Retail Sales; headline retail sales was up 5.3% MoM in January, way more than expectations for a MoM growth rate of 1.1%. The YoY rate rose to 7.4%, up from 2.5% in December. Clearly, the impact of the latest round of fiscal stimulus, which included a $600 cheque for each adult American citizen, was much more positive on consumer spending than anticipated. Economic reopening as Covid-19 cases dropped in many parts of the US also seems to have helped.\n\nThe Core and Control measures of retail sales growth in January were even stronger than the headline figure. The latter of these is an important component in GDP growth calculations and, as a result, economists will be rethinking calls for negative US economic growth in the first quarter of 2021. While the MoM rate of retail sales growth should ease back in the coming months as the positive impulse of stimulus cheques wanes, excess savings and the return of pent-up demand ought to keep consumer spending strongly supported.\n\nTurning to Producer Price Inflation; that was also sharply higher in January. Producer Prices grew at a MoM pace of 1.3%, pushing the YoY rate of price growth to 1.7%. The steep rise in prices in January is expected to followed by another rise in February that will reflect the recent steep rise in carbon-based energy. Wednesday\u2019s data may serve as adding further fuel behind the recent rise in US bond yields if it boosts expectations for Fed monetary policy tightening down the line.\n\nMeanwhile, Industrial Production data for January also beat consensus expectations, posting 0.9% MoM growth versus expectations for a monthly growth rate of 0.5%. In sum, Wednesday\u2019s strong data is likely a taste of what\u2019s to come throughout 2021; i.e. consumer spending continuing to roar higher amid stimulus and economic reopening and higher inflation. This is unlikely to be a particularly positive combination for precious metals markets, which seem to perform better when the economy is struggling and central banks have to actively step in with money supply expansion as a means of stimulus.\n\nThe strong US data seems to have triggered some nerves in risk assets; the S&P 500 trades down about 0.7% in a very minor continuation of the pullback from Tuesday\u2019s record high opening levels and European equities for the most part closed in the red. Seemingly, good US data is being seen as bad data if it undermines market expectations for an accommodative Fed for a long time.\n\nMeanwhile, US Senator Manchin (one of the more moderate Democrats) said he will not be backing US President Joe Biden's rescue package if it is in violation of Senate budgetary rules. Assuming no Republicans vote in favour of the Biden administration\u2019s aid package, which they hope to pass via a process called budget reconciliation that means only a simple majority is needed in the Senate, Manchin\u2019s vote is going to be crucial. Weakness in risk assets is also not helpful to risk-sensitive NZD.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "GBP, AUD End Week Near 3-Year Highs | Investing.com NG", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "9 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Kathy Lien", "body": ""}, {"headline": "NZD/USD bears in control, targetting daily channel support", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/HR1u4jvIziBURSVqf6n9_g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/4ad3f7cde52df3231f1309328bf38692", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "NZD/USD is under pressure in Tokyo as the US dollar firms some more following a strong performance in Wall Street ad the European session.\u00a0\n\nAt the time of writing, NZD/USD is trading at 0.7194 between a low of 0.7182 and 0.7211, down some 0.2% on the session so far.\u00a0\n\nNZD/USD initially rose from 0.7240 to 0.7269, before falling to 0.7200 in New York.\n\nThe Kiwi has given back territory\u00a0from a 6-week high On Monday as\u00a0rising US bond yields take front and centre of the forex space, propelling the greenback to test recent resistance.\u00a0\n\n''A steeper yield curve is generally a good sign, but it was well expected and this looks more like a positioning move/retracement rather than the start of a big USD move,'' analysts at ANZ Bank argued.\n\nSpecifically for the kiwi, the analysts explained that\u00a0the market has shown its capacity to look through the move to covid Levels 2/3 locally; ''that seems appropriate given how well-resourced the Government is to tackle any outbreaks.

Thus, USD major pairs have been granted some respite and NZD/USD has been able to rally back from Wednesday session lows in the 0.7150s to trade in the 0.7190s at the start of the Thursday Asia Pacific session.\n\nTechnical factors were also in play in aiding NZD/USD recovery from Wednesday\u2019s session lows.

January Housing data (Building Permits and Housing Starts), Weekly Jobless Claims numbers and February\u2019s Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing survey report will all also be released at 13:30GMT, thus the US dollar could be choppy around this time.\n"}, {"headline": "US Dollar Price Action Setups: AUD/USD, DXY, NZD/USD, USD/CAD", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/7my6vELlhsolWkp4HPp58g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/063085c9015523ec17ebca884f284d8c", "auther": "Daniel Moss", "body": "As mentioned in previous report, the haven-associated US Dollar may continue to lose ground against its major counterparts, as long-term price analysis suggests a cyclical downturn is in the offing. \n\nDXY monthly chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe chart above highlights the cyclical pattern seen in the US Dollar Index over the past 34 years, with the DXY largely adhering to what appears to be a 16-year rotation. The index set significant bottoms in 1992 and 2008. \n\nAfter bottoming out, price then seems to rebound aggressively early in the cycle, soaring 24.1% and 26.8% in 1993 and 2009 respectively, before pulling back to key support at the 88.6% Fibonacci. A 6-year period of sustained USD strength follows this counter-trend pullback, with price climbing 50.1% from the 1995 low and 42.8% from the 2011 low, to set key highs in 2001 and 2017. \n\nBearish RSI divergence in late 2002 seemed to signal the end of the US Dollar\u2019s bull run and triggered a shift in overall market sentiment, as price collapsed through uptrend support and ell 41.6% to eventually bottom in March 2008. \n\nRecent price action and the development of the RSI is strikingly similar to that seen in the first quarter of 2003 and could be indicative of further downside for the DXY, as price slices through the September 2020 low (91.75) and hurtles towards the 2018 low (88.25). \n\nAn extended downside push towards the 100% Fibonacci expansion (83.50) looks likely if the 2018 low is breached, with cycle analysis suggesting price could fall a further 23% from current levels before bottoming out in mid-2024. \n\nAUD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nThe longer-term technical outlook for AUD/USD remains overtly bullish, as price surges above the August 2020 high (0.7413) to challenge the psychologically imposing 0.7800 mark. \n\nWith the MACD hovering at its highest levels since 2011, and the RSI eyeing a push into overbought territory, the path of least resistance seems higher. \n\nA bullish \u2018golden cross\u2019 moving average formation also hints at extended gains for the exchange rate in the coming months. \n\nA weekly close above 0.7810 is required to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and clear a path for price to challenge the 2018 high (0.8136). Hurdling that likely brings the 100% Fibonacci (0.8918) into the crosshairs. \n\nHowever, if 0.7800 successfully stifles buying pressure, a short-term pullback to the yearly low (0.7564) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 38.14% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.62 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 20.49% higher than yesterday and 0.10% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 10.93% higher than yesterday and 13.40% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests AUD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is less net-short than yesterday but more net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed AUD/USD trading bias.\n\nNZD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nNZD/USD rates also seem poised to continue pushing higher, as price storms away from the support range at 0.7100 \u2013 0.7130. \n\nThe development of the RSI hints at swelling bullish momentum, as the oscillator continues to track the uptrend extending from the March lows and eyes an entry into overbought territory.\n\nA weekly close above 0.7250 likely paves the way for buyers to drive the exchange rate towards the 61.8% Fibonacci (0.7333). Breaching that opens to door for a challenge of the 2017 high (0.7558). \n\nConversely, failing to break above the psychologically imposing 0.7300 mark could allow sellers to force NZD/USD back towards the yearly low (0.7096). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 39.33% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.54 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 15.38% higher than yesterday and 17.10% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 9.95% higher than yesterday and 2.21% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests NZD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current NZD/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nUSD/CAD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nUSD/CAD looks set to extend recent losses, as price continues to track within the confines of a Descending Channel. \n\nA \u2018death cross\u2019 moving average formation, in combination with the RSI dipping to its lowest levels since 2017, suggests the path of least resistance is lower. \n\nPiercing range support at 1.2555 \u2013 1.2590 likely intensifies selling pressure and clears a path for price to challenge the 2018 low (1.2247). \n\nHowever, if support remains intact, a rebound back towards channel resistance and the 21-EMA could be in the offing (1.2599). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 72.92% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.69 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 11.33% higher than yesterday and 8.63% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 37.76% higher than yesterday and 19.61% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests USD/CAD prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is less net-long than yesterday but more net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed USD/CAD trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "NZD/USD Price Analysis: Firmer above key SMA confluence, eyes monthly resistance", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/y.TDUgdzKcz6pApJg4oBOw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/496c734a120a8d224b962fc54c9d99fc", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "NZD/USD stays on the front foot, currently up 0.25% at intraday high of 0.7239, during early Monday.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) finished at $52.14 on January 29. The next session, February 1, the USD/CAD closed at 1.2861, the highest it had been and the lowest for the loonie, since December 22.\n\nFrom that WTI close in January to Tuesday's finish at $58.42 oil jumped 12.04%, and to Thursday's completion at 1.2699 the USD/CAD had lost and the loonie had gained 1.3%. The minor retreat\u00a0in WTI on Thursday to $57.90, profit-taking on the sharp February gains, led to Friday's initial reversal higher in the USD/CAD. But oil's late surge to $59.72\u00a0as London closed (5:00 pm in the UK, noon in NY) and after eliminated all of the USD/CAD gains for the day which dutifully dropped from.12763 to 1.2677 before recovering\u00a0to 1.2698.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week's strength in the loonie dollar came despite a terrible Net Change in Employment report for January last Friday. The Canadian economy shed 212,800 jobs more than four times the -47,500 forecast and the second loss in a row.\n\nIn the US payrolls rose 49,000 in January. The Canadian unemployment rate climbed to 9.4% in January from 8.9%, in the US it fell to 6.3% from 6.7% and yet the US dollar fell and the Canadian rose. For the loonie, the price of oil and the prospects for the energy market are the strongest components.\n\nThe break of the minor descending channel on January 27 has lost\u00a0its significance as the USD/CAD faltered at 1.2900. The failure on February 1 at 1.2863 to breach the January high of 1.2881 has proven to the\u00a0deciding point.\n\nAmerican data did not suggest a strengthening recovery with weak consumer prices in January, over 800,000 unemployment claims for the last two weeks and a drop in Consumer Sentiment.\n\nA drop in US Treasury rates mid-week may have help to undermine the USD/CAD. After last Friday's close in the 10-year bond at 1.1700, the highest finish since March 18, yields dipped to 1.157 on Tuesday and 1.1330 on Wednesday. The yield recovered on Friday to 1.195% but could not contest the impact of WTI\u00a0on the USD/CAD.\n\nUS 10-year Treasury yield\n\n\n\nThe US stimulus package wending its way through Congress had been one source of recent dollar strength with the logic that whatever its final composition and amount it will boost consumer spending which was dismal in the fourth quarter. Its delay may have added to the USD/CAD decline. Even though January Nonfarm Payrolls were on target at 49,000, the much stronger ADP report and the continuing strength of the Purchasing Managers' Indexes had given a lift to late expectations, and the status quo report in that light was a disappointment.\n\nThere has also been a minor revival of inflation concerns even though there is no evidence of such and Federal Reserve Chairman Powell\u00a0has discounted it. The size of the US budget deficits over the past five years and the continual money creation by the government is a classic prelude\u00a0to inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally Chairman Powell's dovish comments in a speech to the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday that the labor market remains weak and the bank is not considering a rate increase or a reduction in the bond purchase program may have detracted from a rising dollar based on higher Treasury rates.\n\nThe competition for supremacy between the Canadian and US dollars is a contest tilting the American economy against the price of oil.\n\nThis week oil won with WTI rising, poor US data and a less than optimistic Fed.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday\u00a0January's US Retail Sales will set the stage for first quarter consumption. After three negative months in a row, the forecast modest rise is essential for greenback improvement.\n\nWithout better US statistics and a completed stimulus package it will be difficult for the USD/CAD to gain ground against an energized oil market. Even rising US Treasury rates, the 10-year closed at 1.195%, did not deter the oil-fueled gains of the loonie. The dominance of oil\u00a0pricing on the\u00a0USD/CAD\u00a0over the direct evidence of a contracting Canadian labor market\u00a0in\u00a0Janaury is not illogical.\u00a0 Nothing can create jobs in Canada as effectively or quickly as the\u00a0energy sector.\n\nTechnically, the eight-month descending\u00a0channel maintains its grip exhibiting a succession of\u00a0lower tops with each recovery, even though the five-figure wide channel has ample room for consolidation. Support at 1.2700, the close on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday did not hold on Friday in the face of a relentlessly bid WTI.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFriday\n\nWholesale Sales dropped 1.3% in December, on a -1.6% forecast and November's 0.7% increase.\n\n\n\nFXStreet\n\nIn a speech to the Economic Club of New York\u00a0on Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was neutral on the state of the US economy and stresssed the need for continuing monetary policy and fiscal support. He said that the job market remained weak though improved from the worst of the recession. He indicated that the central bank isn't considering an increase in the fed funds rate or a reduction\u00a0in the $120 billion of monthly credit purchases designed to keep interest rates low.\n\nConsistent with the Fed's focus on employment, Mr Powell observed\u00a0that four million jobless workers have dropped out of the labor force and are not counted in the standard (U-3) unemployment rate at 6.3%. Were these workers\u00a0included the rate would be close to 10%. He noted that among the highest-earning quarter of the population\u00a0job loses have been 4%, while layoffs among the bottom quarter\u00a0were 17%.\n\nThe 'Underemployment Rate' (U-6) which counts discouraged and part-time workers was 11.1% in January, the lowest of the pandemic era and down from 11.7% in December. It's peak was 22.8% in April 2020.\n\nTuesday\n\nJob Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), a measure employment vacancies report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, registered 6.646 million available posts in December, more thanthte 6.5 million forecast and November's 6.572 million.\n\nWednesday\n\nThe Consumer Price Index in January rose 0.3% as expected, down from 0.4% in December. Annual CPI climbed 1.4% as in December on a 1.5% estimate for January.\n\nCore CPI was flat in January missing the 0.2% prediction, after a 0.1% gain in December. The annual rate was 1.4%, under the 1.5%\u00a0prediction\u00a0and December's 1.6% rate. Wholesale Inventories rose 0.3% in December more than the 0.1% estimate and November rate.\n\nThursday\n\nInitial Jobless Claims were 793,000 in the February 5 week, down from the revised 812,000 prior result, (initially 779,000) but worse than the 757,00 forecast. Claims were 4.545 million in the January 29 week, just over the 4.49 million estimate and lower than the 4.69 million previous week.\n\nFriday\n\nThe Michigan Consumer Sentient Index slipped to 76.2 in February\u00a0from 79 in January. A reading of 80.8 had been forecast.\n\n\n\nFXStreet\n\nRetail Sales for December and Housing Starts for January have the most potential for impact.\n\nMonday\n\nManufacturing Sales for December are due.

December's results were -0.2% (MoM) and 0.7% (YoY). The Bank of Canada Core CPI was -0.4% (MoM) and 1.5% (YoY) in December.\n\nThursday\n\nADP Employment Change for January is out. December shed 28,800 positions.\n\nFriday\n\nRetail Sales in December are expected to rise 0.1% after gaining 1.3% in November. Sales ex autos are forecast to add 0.3% following a 2.1% increase in December.\n\n\n\nFXStreet\n\nRetail Sales for January predominate. After three unusual negative months markets want to know if the fourth quarter decline in sales has ended now that the California lockdown is over. Variation will translate to the dollar.\n\nMonday\n\nUS Holiday President's Day\n\nWednesday\n\nRetail Sales are expected to rise 0.7% in January after an equivalent negative in December. Retail Sales ex-Autos are forecast to rise 0.8% after falling 1.4% in December. The Retail Sales Control Group is projected to gain 0.4% following the 1.9% plummet I December. The Producer Price Index (PPI) is expected to add 0.4% in January after a 0.3% increase in December. The annual rate rose 0.8% in December. Core PPI is predicted to rise 0.2% in January after 0.1%in December. The annual Core rate was 1.2% in December. Industrial Production is forecast to gain 0.4% in January subsequent to 1.6%in December. Capacity Utilization is forecast to rise ti 74.8% in January from 74.5% prior. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) Housing Market Index is anticipated to be unchanged at 83 in February.\n\nThursday\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey is expected to drop to 20\u00a0in February from 26.5 in January. Initial Jobless Claims are forecast to be 775,000 in the February 12 week.\u00a0Continuing claims are projected to rise to 4.575 million.

Markit Services PMI for February is projected to drop to 57.5\u00a0from 58.3 in January. Markit Manufacturing PMI is expected to fall to 58.5 in February from 59.2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactive collapse in USD/CAD on Friday as WTI raced to a new 13-month high into the London close took no notice of the formerly steady support at 1.2700 and the close below leaves a heavy flavor on the pair to start the new week.\u00a0\n\nWith its run to\u00a0nearly $60 on Friday WTI is about at the half-way point of its range from January 2019 to the start of the pandemic in the US\u00a0in March 2020.\u00a0If, as expected, the US and global economies begin to show signs of revival, WTI should trade higher, especially as the range\u00a0for 2018 was above $65 for\u00a0most of the year and reached $76.80.\u00a0Given WTI's\u00a0demonstrated link to the Canadian dollar\u00a0the bias for the USD/CAD is lower.\n\n\n\nRecent support for the USD/CAD is limited and does not extend below 1.2640. The three year\u00a0low of 1.2590 on Janaury 21 is too transient to provide more than a pause. The\u00a021-day moving average at 1.2743 was crossed on Wednesday and is now part of resistance at 1.2740. The 100-day at 1.2945 would back the line at 1.2925 were the USD/CAD rise that far. The\u00a0200-day at 1.3205 is in abeyance. The Relative Strength Index at\u00a043.45 though not far from\u00a0neutral is a sell given Friday's action.\u00a0\n\nResistance: 1.2740; 1.2825; 1.2860; 1.2925\n\nSupport: 1.2660; 1.2640; 1.2590\n\n\n\nThe FXStreet Forecast Poll\u00a0\u00a0is mildly bullish out to one quarter. It is not a rising trend but a consolidation\u00a0near the middle of the descending\u00a0channel. The reaction of the USD/CAD to rising\u00a0crude oil prices makes further losses a distinct\u00a0posibility.\n"}, {"headline": "US Dollar Price Action Setups: AUD/USD, DXY, NZD/USD, USD/CAD", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/7my6vELlhsolWkp4HPp58g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/063085c9015523ec17ebca884f284d8c", "auther": "Daniel Moss", "body": "As mentioned in previous report, the haven-associated US Dollar may continue to lose ground against its major counterparts, as long-term price analysis suggests a cyclical downturn is in the offing. \n\nDXY monthly chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe chart above highlights the cyclical pattern seen in the US Dollar Index over the past 34 years, with the DXY largely adhering to what appears to be a 16-year rotation. The index set significant bottoms in 1992 and 2008. \n\nAfter bottoming out, price then seems to rebound aggressively early in the cycle, soaring 24.1% and 26.8% in 1993 and 2009 respectively, before pulling back to key support at the 88.6% Fibonacci. A 6-year period of sustained USD strength follows this counter-trend pullback, with price climbing 50.1% from the 1995 low and 42.8% from the 2011 low, to set key highs in 2001 and 2017. \n\nBearish RSI divergence in late 2002 seemed to signal the end of the US Dollar\u2019s bull run and triggered a shift in overall market sentiment, as price collapsed through uptrend support and ell 41.6% to eventually bottom in March 2008. \n\nRecent price action and the development of the RSI is strikingly similar to that seen in the first quarter of 2003 and could be indicative of further downside for the DXY, as price slices through the September 2020 low (91.75) and hurtles towards the 2018 low (88.25). \n\nAn extended downside push towards the 100% Fibonacci expansion (83.50) looks likely if the 2018 low is breached, with cycle analysis suggesting price could fall a further 23% from current levels before bottoming out in mid-2024. \n\nAUD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nThe longer-term technical outlook for AUD/USD remains overtly bullish, as price surges above the August 2020 high (0.7413) to challenge the psychologically imposing 0.7800 mark. \n\nWith the MACD hovering at its highest levels since 2011, and the RSI eyeing a push into overbought territory, the path of least resistance seems higher. \n\nA bullish \u2018golden cross\u2019 moving average formation also hints at extended gains for the exchange rate in the coming months. \n\nA weekly close above 0.7810 is required to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and clear a path for price to challenge the 2018 high (0.8136). Hurdling that likely brings the 100% Fibonacci (0.8918) into the crosshairs. \n\nHowever, if 0.7800 successfully stifles buying pressure, a short-term pullback to the yearly low (0.7564) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 38.14% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.62 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 20.49% higher than yesterday and 0.10% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 10.93% higher than yesterday and 13.40% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests AUD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is less net-short than yesterday but more net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed AUD/USD trading bias.\n\nNZD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nNZD/USD rates also seem poised to continue pushing higher, as price storms away from the support range at 0.7100 \u2013 0.7130. \n\nThe development of the RSI hints at swelling bullish momentum, as the oscillator continues to track the uptrend extending from the March lows and eyes an entry into overbought territory.\n\nA weekly close above 0.7250 likely paves the way for buyers to drive the exchange rate towards the 61.8% Fibonacci (0.7333). Breaching that opens to door for a challenge of the 2017 high (0.7558). \n\nConversely, failing to break above the psychologically imposing 0.7300 mark could allow sellers to force NZD/USD back towards the yearly low (0.7096). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 39.33% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.54 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 15.38% higher than yesterday and 17.10% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 9.95% higher than yesterday and 2.21% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests NZD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current NZD/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nUSD/CAD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nUSD/CAD looks set to extend recent losses, as price continues to track within the confines of a Descending Channel. \n\nA \u2018death cross\u2019 moving average formation, in combination with the RSI dipping to its lowest levels since 2017, suggests the path of least resistance is lower. \n\nPiercing range support at 1.2555 \u2013 1.2590 likely intensifies selling pressure and clears a path for price to challenge the 2018 low (1.2247). \n\nHowever, if support remains intact, a rebound back towards channel resistance and the 21-EMA could be in the offing (1.2599). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 72.92% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.69 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 11.33% higher than yesterday and 8.63% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 37.76% higher than yesterday and 19.61% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests USD/CAD prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is less net-long than yesterday but more net-long from last week.

The release follows US retail sales earlier this week, but the numbers are expected to be much worse. US retail sales sizzled in January, with a gain of 5.3%, good enough for a seven-month high. The street consensus call for declines of -2.5% for headline retail sales and -2.4% for core retail sales, respectively. This would point to a sharp contraction in consumer spending, and if the forecasts prove accurate, we can expect the Canadian dollar to fall in the North American session.\n\nCanada\u2019s ADP nonfarm payrolls report has managed just one gain over the past five months, pointing to weakness in the labor market.

Trimmed CPI, which excludes the most volatile items in the headline read, rose from 1.6% to 1.8%.\n\nUS Retail Sales sparkle\n\nIn the US, Retail Sales for January was much stronger than anticipated, with a sharp gain of 5.9%. This comes after two straight declines and was the strongest gain since May. The sparkling reading can be attributed to an easing in health restrictions, as well as the latest round in stimulus payments. The Biden stimulus package is winding its way through Congress and should be approved in March. The additional stimulus is expected to trigger a further increase in consumer spending, a key driver of economic activity.\n\nThe FOMC minutes will be released later in the day (19:00 GMT). The minutes are expected to reiterate the ultra-accommodative stance of the Fed, and will provide details of the policy meeting from earlier this month. The Federal Reserve has been careful to telegraph its dovish stance to the markets, so the minutes are unlikely to have much impact on the US dollar, barring any surprise comments from the FOMC members in the minutes.\n\n.\n\nUSD/CAD Technical\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\u00a0www.marketpulse.com/economic-events/\n\nThis article is for general information purposes only.

The rebound threatens the broader bearish stance and we continue to look for inflection off this zone to offer guidance in the days ahead on whether this is a bear market recovery or a larger reversal. These are the updated targets and invalidation levels that matter on the USD/CAD weekly technical price. Review my latest Strategy Webinar for an in-depth breakdown of this Loonie technical setup and more.\n\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Technical Strategist; USD/CAD on Tradingview\n\nNotes: In last month\u2019s Canadian Dollar Weekly Price Outlook we noted that the, \u201cUSD/CAD breakdown may be losing steam here as price responds to confluence downtrend support. From a trading standpoint, the threat for a larger recovery remains while above 1.2579.\u201d Price registered a low at 1.2610 today before reversing sharply higher with price poised to mark an outside-day reversal in early US trade.\n\nLoonie turned just ahead of the January lows in USD/CAD and keeps the yearly range in focus while above key confluence support at the 2018 yearly open / 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of 2017 advance at 1.2579-1.2619. Initial weekly resistance eyed at the low-week close at 1.2727 with a breach / weekly close above monthly open resistance at 1.2785 needed to mark a larger reversal. Key resistance / bearish invalidation steady at t the 2020 yearly open at 1.2975. A break lower from here would risk accelerated losses for the US Dollar with such a scenario exposing subsequent support objectives at the 2018 low-week close at 1.2421 and the 88.6% retracement at 1.2358.\n\nBottom line: The Canadian Dollar is consolidating within the yearly opening-range just above key technical support at 1.2579-1.2619. From a trading standpoint, a good zone for possible price inflection with the broader short-bias vulnerable while above. Be on the lookout for downside exhaustion head of this threshold with a breach / close above the monthly open at 1.2785 needed to suggest a more significant low is in place.

The headline CPI is expected to rise by 0.4% during the reported month as against 0.2% fall recorded in December. The yearly CPI is anticipated to have edged higher to 0.8% from the previous month's reading of 0.7%. Meanwhile, the BoC's core CPI is anticipated to remain flat MoM and ease to 1.4% from 1.5% on yearly basis.\n\nAhead of the key macro data, some strong follow-through US dollar buying assisted the USD/CAD pair to build on the previous day's solid bounce from the vicinity of the 1.2600 mark. However, the ongoing bullish run in crude oil prices underpinned the commodity-linked loonie and capped gains for the pair, rather prompted some selling at higher levels.\n\nMeanwhile, the market reaction to the data is more likely to remain limited as the focus will be on the release of the latest FOMC meeting minutes. Nevertheless, any significant divergence from the expected numbers might still produce some meaningful trading opportunities.\n\nAccording to Nenad Kerkez, Head of Technical Analysis and Trading at Elite CurrenSea: \"1.2705-30 is the POC zone. We could see a drop off the zone towards the both weekly and daily camarilla pivot points. The final target might be the D L5 \u00a0- 1.2589.

The purchasing power of CAD is dragged down by inflation. The Bank of Canada aims at an inflation range (1%-3%). Generally speaking, a high reading is seen as anticipatory of a rate hike and is positive (or bullish) for the CAD.\n\nConsumer Price Index Core is released by the Bank of Canada. \u201cCore\u201d CPI excludes fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest, intercity transportation, and tobacco products. These volatile core 8 are considered as the key indicator for inflation in Canada. Generally speaking, a high reading anticipates a hawkish attitude by the BoC, and that is said to be positive (or bullish) for the CAD.\n"}, {"headline": "GBP, AUD End Week Near 3-Year Highs |

In this case, the price is expected to break 7/8 and then continue growing to reach the resistance at 8/8. Still, this scenario may no longer be valid if the price breaks 6/8 to the downside. After that, the instrument may fall to reach the support at 5/8.\n\n\n\nAs we can see in the M15 chart, the pair has broken the upside line of the VoltyChannel indicator and, as a result, may continue the ascending tendency.\n\n\n\nIn the H4 chart, XAUUSD is trading below the 200-day Moving Average\u0431 thus indicating a descending tendency. In this case, the price is expected to break 1/8 and then continue falling to reach the closest support at 0/8. However, this scenario may no longer be valid if the price breaks the resistance at 2/8 to the upside. After that, the instrument may correct to the upside towards 3/8.\n\n\n\nAs we can see in the M15 chart, the price has broken the downside line of the VoltyChannel indicator and, as a result, may continue falling to reach 0/8 from the H4 chart.\n\n\n"}, {"headline": "USD/CHF likely to run into some resistance", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/QTrqavbvLQZXNp2VgqpN_A--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bb8d37bd99039b8b1bd064dc0c763114", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "The Swissie may hold up it's end of the bargain.

EUR/USD\u2019s break threw normal price markets deeply off course since August 2020.\n\nNon USD currency pairs such as DXY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY only option since August 2020 was to concur with EUR/USD and non USD rises by trading deeply oversold week to week and to break 5 and 10 year averages.\n\nEUR/USD and non USD currency pairs as risk assets followed risk asset counterparts in stock markets higher to current richter scale overbought levels. The S&P's at 3900.00's trade at\u00a0 extreme overbought levels. The DAX achieved all time highs. Stock market longs are virtually impossible until a significant correction occurs.\n\nDXY\n\nDXY for example just broke above its 10 year monthly average at 89.95 and contains a long way to travel to the 5 year average at 95.00\u2019s. A currency pair to trade at a 10 year monthly average is not only a low, low price but extraordinary and highlights the magnitude to the\u00a0 rises and falls since last August.\n\nNext averages above to break are located at 91.43, 92.78 then 94.39 and 94.16. DXY from monthly averages 1 to 7 years faces stiff resistance from 94.00's to 95.00's. A break through this brick wall then DXY will travel easily to 97.00's and 99.00's.\n\nDXY below 89.95 targets 86.43, 84.32 and 81.83 at extreme oversold.\n\nTargets for DXY above 89.95 are located at 90.86, above 91.43 then 92.15,\u00a0 92.47 and 92.66. Above 92.78 targets 92.87 and 92.89.\n\nDXY from current ranges from 89.95 to 92.78 trade at its widest ranges. As DXY travels higher then ranges severely compress. The opposite is true for EUR/USD as the higher it trades then ranges open much wider.\n\nDespite a low price and trade below monthly 5 year averages, DXY is mid range to oversold/ overbought.\n\nS&P's\n\nDXY viewed from the S&P's informs trade location miles above the 5 year monthly average at 2722.43 and at overbought to extremes. Overbought S&P's reveals a healthy correction is on the way, DXY higher and EUR/USD as well as non USD currency pairs to follow much lower.\n\nThe S&P's are held by immediate averages at 3257.68, 3119.54 and 2989.17. A correction targets 3598.53, 3416.84 and 3300.20. A 400 point correction to the S&P's assumes DXY travels 300 ish pips higher and\u00a0 breaks above 92.78 to trade between 92.78 to 94.39.\n\nS&P averages from 3257.68 travels every 100 points to 2200.00's at the 10 year monthly average. Current S&P's ranges are fairly suppressed however as S&P's drop then ranges expand as the downside gains progresses.\n\nGold\n\nGold trades above its 5 year monthly average at 1461.20 and trades misaligned to the S&P's. Gold and the DXY are the same assets and should trade below 5 year monthly averages while the S&P's trade above.\n\nGold's drop is held by 1815.65 and below targets 1642.17 and 1543.98. Gold is deeply overbought from a medium and long term perspective. Gold is finished above at 1943.62 and short is the only trade available.\u00a0\n\nMoving forward, long USD and DXY is the best option while short Gold and the S&P's although Gold lacks any real range capability. Gold viewed from 150 to 200 points is a viable option as it fails to contain any big price moves.\n"}, {"headline": "Weekly Round up Feb 14 2021", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/W_g5AXwSfhErw5QEf6z5Eg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/9aaa70d858e70def64ca4a4dec40d97e", "auther": "Brian Twomey", "body": "Overall, EUR/USD was the first currency in August 2020 to break above its 5 year average at 1.1300\u2019s then the 10 year average in December 2020 at 1.2100\u2019s.

By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "Europe Roundup: Sterling hits $1.40 for first time in nearly 3 years, European stocks rise, Gold...", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "EconoTimes", "date": "22 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.r50wD5Zi9ef.KuzyV.kRA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/062d38f549f90d3f59f9d1dfe5598811", "auther": "Friday", "body": "Market Roundup\n\n\u2022German Jan PPI (YoY) \u00a00.9%,0.3% forecast, 0.2% previous\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u2022German Jan PPI (MoM) \u00a01.4%, 0.8% forecast, 0.8% previous\n\n\u2022UK Jan Public Sector Net Borrowing \u00a08.02B, 33.38B previous\n\n\u2022UK Jan Retail Sales (MoM) -8.2%, -2.5% forecast, 0.3% previous\n\n\u2022UK Jan Core Retail Sales (YoY) \u00a0-3.8%,2.2% forecast, 6.4% previous\n\n\u2022UK Jan Core Retail Sales (MoM ) -8.8%,\u00a0 -2.6% forecast, 0.4% previous\n\n\u2022UK Jan Retail Sales (YoY) -5.9%,-1.3% forecast, 2.9% previous\n\n\u2022French Jan HICP (MoM) \u00a00.3%,0.3% forecast, 0.3% previous\n\n\u2022French Jan CPI (MoM) \u00a00.1%,0.2% forecast, 0.2% previous\n\n\u2022French Feb Services PMI \u00a043.6, 47.0 forecast, 47.3 previous\n\n\u2022German Feb Manufacturing PMI \u00a060.6, 56.5 forecast, 57.1 previous\n\n\u2022Italian Jan CPI (MoM ) 0.7%,0.5% forecast, 0.2% previous\n\n\u2022EU Feb Markit Composite PMI \u00a048.1, 48.0 forecast, 47.8 previous\n\n\u2022UK Manufacturing PMI 54.9, 53.2 forecast, 54.1 previous\n\n\u2022UK Services PMI 49.7, 41.0 forecast, 39.5 previous\n\n\u2022UK Composite PMI 49.8, 42.2 forecast, 41.2 previous\n\nLooking Ahead - Economic Data (GMT)\n\n\u202213:30 Canada Dec Core Retail Sales (MoM) -2.0% forecast, 2.1% previous\n\n\u202213:30 Canada Retail Sales (MoM) -2.5%forecast, 1.3% previous\n\n\u202214:45 US Feb Markit Composite PMI 58.7 forecast, 58.3 previous\n\n\u202214:45 US Feb Markit Composite PMI\u00a0 58.7 previous\n\n\u202215:00 US Jan Existing Home Sales \u00a0\u00a06.61M forecast, 6.76M previous\n\n\u202215:00 US Jan Existing Home Sales (MoM) \u00a0-1.5%,0.7% previous\n\nLooking Ahead - Economic events and other releases (GMT)\n\n\u202215:00US Fed Monetary Policy Report\n\nFx Beat\u00a0\n\nEUR/USD: The euro rose against dollar on Friday as single currency was driven up by a surge in global bond yields fuelled by expectations of reflation in the United States. The dollar lost ground, ending its first two-day winning streak in two weeks as disappointing labor market data tempered expectations for a speedy economic recovery from the global health crisis. The euro rose 0.4% to $1.2134. The single currency showed little reaction to purchasing manager index data, which showed a slowdown in business activity in February. However, factories had their busiest month in three years, buoying sentiment. Immediate resistance can be seen at 1.2143(50Fib%), an upside break can trigger rise towards 1.2213 (61.8%fib).On the downside, immediate support is seen at 1.2075(38.2%fib), a break below could take the pair towards 1.2026(16th Feb low).\n\nGBP/USD: Sterling hit $1.40 against the dollar for first time in nearly 3 years on Friday, as investors bet Britain's quick pace of vaccinations will lead to an economic rebound from the country's worst crash in output in 300 years.At 12:30 GMT, the pound hit $1.4005 against the dollar, up 0.2% on the day. That level was its highest since April 2018.

Immediate resistance can be seen at 1.4032(April 23rd high 2018), an upside break can trigger rise towards 1.4100(Psychological level).On the downside, immediate support is seen at 1.3911(23.6%fib), a break below could take the pair towards 1.3801 (38.2%fib).\n\nUSD/CHF: The dollar declined against the Swiss franc on Friday as U.S. dollar was knocked by disappointing jobs data. The U.S. currency had been rising in recent days as a jump in Treasury yields on the back of the so-called reflation trade drew investors. But an unexpected increase in U.S. weekly jobless claims soured the economic outlook and sent the dollar lower.On Friday it traded down 0.3% against a basket of currencies, with the dollar index at 90.309. Immediate resistance can be seen at 0.8943 (50%fib), an upside break can trigger rise towards 0.8981(38.2%fib).On the downside, immediate support is seen at 0.8892(61.8%fib), a break below could take the pair towards 0.8873 (Feb 18th low).\n\nUSD/JPY: The dollar declined against the Japanese yen on Friday after disappointing U.S. labour market data bruised optimism for the country's speedy recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.The greenback continued to buck its traditional role as a safe-harbour currency, falling in sympathy with U.S. stocks overnight after an unexpected increase in weekly jobless claims soured the economic outlook. The string of soft labour data is weighing on the dollar even as other indicators have shown resilience, and as President Joe Biden's pandemic relief efforts take shape, including a proposed $1.9 trillion spending package.

Current USD/JPY at 105.74 trades 84 pips above its vital high/ low point at 104.89. This line is rising. EUR/USD trades around its current high /low point at 1.2039. This line moved 1 pip lower since yesterday\u2019s ECB at 10 A.M. EST. EUR/USD and USD/JPY achieved its crowning achievement by rhe great divide to currency pairs.\n\nUSD/CAD at 1.2600\u2019s and GBP/USD at 1.3800\u2019s or 1200 pips informs this distance is far to wide. GBP/USD trade to 1.4000\u2019s while USD/CAD was located at 1.2500\u2019s or 1500 pips assisted to diminish the distance yet 1200 pips informs a big move is ahead. Normal distance is 3 to 500 pips.\n\nFor the past four weeks as written, JPY cross pairs were and continue to trade in severely overbought territory. The degree of overbought is recognized as 500 pips from AUD/USD 0.7700\u2019s and AUD/JPY at 82.00\u2019s and 500 pips from NZD/USD 0.7100\u2019s to NZD/JPY 76.00\u2019s. Normal is in the vicinity of 100 to 200 pips maximum because NZD/USD and NZD/JPY are the exact same currency pairs much the same as AUD/USD and AUD/JPY.\n\nThe divide grows wider at 800 pips from GBP/USD 1.3600\u2019s to GBP/JPY at 147.00\u2019s and 700 pips from EUR/USD 1.2000\u2019s to 127.00\u2019s for EUR/JPY and normal is 100 to 200 because GBP/USD and GBP/JPY are the exact same currency pairs much the same as EUR/USD and EUR/JPY.\n\nUSD pairs EUR/NZD at 1.6700\u2019s trades 2500 pips to GBP/NZD 1.9200\u2019s. Normal trades around 1600 to 1800 pips and 700 pips off kilter.\n\nThe EUR/USD and USD/JPY relationship is distinguished by the massive and extreme divide between and among currency pair prices, particularly USD and overall cross pairs as the primary driver to current prices.\n\nToday\u2019s trade is presented as a two trade option by matching significant day trade support, resistance and levels. Short the highs and long the lows.\n\nUSD/JPY highs Vs EUR/USD Lows.\n\nUSD/JPY up target 106.43 vs EUR/USD 1.1985 lows.\n\nUSD/JPY 106.36 Vs EUR/USD 1.1998.\n\nUSD/JPY 106.29 V EUR/USD 1.2011\n\nUSD/JPY 106.16 Vs EUR/USD 1.2015\n\nUSD/JPY 106.09 Vs EUR/USD 1.2023\n\nUSD/JPY 106.03 Vs EUR/USD 1.2028.\n\nUSD/JPY 105.96 Vs EUR/USD 1.2034.\n\nEUR/USD Highs Vs USD/JPY lows\n\nEUR/USD 1.2107 Vs USD/JPY 105.37\n\nEUR/USD 1.2099 Vs USD/JPY 105.44\n\nEUR/USD 1.2091 Vs USD/JPY 105.51\n\nEUR/USD 1.2076 Vs USD/JPY 105.58\n\nEUR/USD 1.2068 Vs USD/JPY 105.63\n\nEUR/USD 1.2061 Vs USD/JPY 105.71\n\nEUR/USD 1.2053 Vs USD/JPY 105.79\n\nEUR/USD 1.2049 Vs USD/JPY 105.87.\n\nEUR/USD is a complete opposite pair to USD/JPY however prices never match pip for pip as the relationship runs 7.62 pips for EUR/USD Vs 6.62 for USD/JPY.As a side note all market prices especially Stock Indices are factored the exact same as a currency price. The difference is in the name and number yet its all the same.\n\nNot many pips trade anymore as the old days of trading therefore pips and profits are maximized by multiple longs and shorts per currency pair.

While rising yields drove the Forex pair into a multi-month high earlier in the week, falling yields triggered a dramatic closing price reversal top on Wednesday that was confirmed the previous session, shifting momentum to the downside.\n\nAt 04:56 GMT, the USD/JPY is trading 105.624, down 0.053 or -0.05%.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields fell in choppy trading on Thursday following the release of weekly jobless claims data and other economic news. This move tightened the spread between U.S. Government bond yields and Japanese Government bond yields, making the U.S. Dollar a less-desirable investment.\n\nThe move in Treasury yields accompanied a higher-than-expected reading for initial jobless claims from last week. Other data releases on Thursday showed the homebuilding market slowing amid high lumber prices and a significant jump for import prices.\n\nThe main trend is up according to the daily swing chart, however, momentum is trending lower. Momentum shifted to the downside on Wednesday with the formation of a closing price reversal top.\n\nA trade through 106.224 will negate the closing price reversal top and signal a resumption of the uptrend. The main trend will change to down on a move through 104.410.\n\nThe USD/JPY is currently trading on the strong side of longer-term retracement zone at 104.821 to 105.347. This zone is potential support.\n\nThe short-term range is 104.410 to 106.224. Its retracement zone at 105.317 to 105.103 is the next potential downside target area.\n\nThe two zones form a potential support cluster at 105.347 to 105.317. Since the main trend is up, buyers could come in on a test of this area.\n\nThe early downside momentum suggests sellers are going to take a run at 105.347 to 105.317. Watch for buyers on the first test of this support cluster. If successful, this could trigger an intraday short-covering rally.\n\nIf 105.317 fails as support then look for the selling to possibly extend into the short-term Fibonacci level at 105.103.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  February 19th 2021: Sterling Clocks Fresh 2021 Peaks Amid Dollar Losses \n-  EUR/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Euro Moves Higher Ahead Of The Weekend \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Retracement Zone at $1787.30 to $1711.70 \n-  The Crypto Daily \u2013 Movers and Shakers \u2013 February 19th, 2021 \n-  Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple\u2019s XRP \u2013 Daily Tech Analysis \u2013 February 19th, 2021 \n"}, {"headline": "USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Trader Reaction to 105.089 \u2013 105.347 Sets This Week\u2019s Tone", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/SXOxBmSKTfwB_xlROlNrlg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/f830dbf2029f8d3febfee5dc11c97cc3", "auther": "James Hyerczyk", "body": "The Dollar/Yen is edging higher on Monday, supported by a boost in U.S. inflation expectations on Friday that pointed toward higher Treasury yields. With Japanese Government bonds holding steady, a jump in U.S. Treasury yields would widen the interest rate differential in favor of the U.S. Dollar, making the greenback a more attractive asset.\n\nAt 07:30 GMT, the USD/JPY is trading 105.142, up 0.220 or +0.21%.\n\nBenchmark U.S. Treasury yields rose to their highest levels since March on Friday as investors closed positions ahead of a long U.S. holiday weekend. U.S. financial markets are closed on Monday for Presidents\u2019 Day.\n\nThe main trend is up according to the daily swing chart, but there is some lost upside momentum due to the February 5 closing price reversal top that fueled a three-day retreat early last week.\n\nA trade through 105.768 will negate the closing price reversal top and signal a resumption of the uptrend. A move through 104.410 will change the main trend to down.\n\nThe USD/JPY is currently trading inside a longer-term retracement zone at 104.821 to 105.347. Trader reaction to this zone will determine the near-term direction.\n\nThe minor range is 105.768 to 104.410. Its retracement zone at 105.089 to 105.249 is also being tested.\n\nThe short-term range is 103.328 to 105.768. Its retracement zone at 104.548 to 104.260 is support. This zone stopped the selling on February 10 at 104.410.\n\nThe direction of the USD/JPY into the close on Monday will be determined by trader reaction to 105.089.\n\nA sustained move over 105.089 will indicate the presence of buyers. This could trigger a further rally into a pair of Fibonacci levels at 105.249 and 105.347. Overtaking the latter will indicate the buying is getting stronger with 105.768 the primary upside target price.\n\nA sustained move under 105.089 will signal the presence of sellers. If this move generates enough downside momentum then look for the selling to possibly extend into 104.821. If this price fails, we could see a retest of the retracement zone at 104.548 to 104.260.\n\nThe test of 105.089 to 105.249 is very important to the chart pattern. Buyers are going to try to overcome this zone in an effort to resume the uptrend. Aggressive counter-trend sellers are going to try to stop the rally in an effort to form a potentially bearish secondary lower top.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  European Equities: Futures Point North Ahead of Key Stats for the Eurozone \n-  Commodity Fund Long Hits New High \n-  EOS, Stellar\u2019s Lumen, and Tron\u2019s TRX \u2013 Daily Analysis \u2013 February 15th, 2021 \n-  Daily Gold News: Monday, Feb. 15 \u2013 Gold\u2019s Short-Term Consolidation \n-  Bitcoin and Ripple\u2019s XRP \u2013 Weekly Technical Analysis \u2013 February 15th, 2021 \n-  Economic Data Puts the EUR in Focus, While the Pound Makes an Early Move \n"}, {"headline": "USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Testing 200 Day EMA", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "19 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/SXOxBmSKTfwB_xlROlNrlg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/f830dbf2029f8d3febfee5dc11c97cc3", "auther": "Christopher Lewis", "body": "The US dollar initially fell during much of the trading session on Friday but found enough support near the 200 day EMA to bounce a bit. This should not be a huge surprise due to the fact that interest rates in America continue to rise, which of course this pair is very sensitive to.\n\nAs there is a greater divergence between the US and Japan, it makes the US dollar much more attractive as the yields offered in that country are superior. Because of this, I do believe that this is a market that is going to be worth watching for the meantime, because it looks to me like we are trying to start some type of major trend change.\n\nIt almost behaves like it did before the Great Financial Crisis, as the US dollar would rally against the Japanese yen in good times, simply because of the interest rate differential. With that in mind, the carry trade is something that a whole new generation of traders may be discovering rather soon. Getting paid a little bit of positive swamp at the end of the session certainly is a bonus if it is available.\n\nAt that point, it becomes more of a longer-term investment and although I think it still a little early to say that is going to be the case, this is clearly a market that could do that. We have recently broken above a major downtrend line, and now are trying to find support at the 200 day EMA yet again. In other words, it is starting to shift towards an upward bias, but these do tend to be very noisy moves when we turn a major trend around.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Go Parabolic \n-  Natural Gas Price Forecast \u2013 Natural Gas Markets Back Early Gains to Plunge \n-  U.S. Market Wrap and Forecast for Monday \n-  EUR/USD Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Euro Finds Support at Crucial Level \n-  Gold Price Forecast \u2013 Gold Markets Bounce from Major Support Level \n-  Gold Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Gold Markets Pull Back to Test Support \n"}, {"headline": "Weekly Round up Feb 14 2021", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/W_g5AXwSfhErw5QEf6z5Eg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/9aaa70d858e70def64ca4a4dec40d97e", "auther": "Brian Twomey", "body": "Overall, EUR/USD was the first currency in August 2020 to break above its 5 year average at 1.1300\u2019s then the 10 year average in December 2020 at 1.2100\u2019s. EUR/USD is categorized in the class of a risk asset and non USD currency.\n\nEUR/USD\u2019s early break to its 5 year average set remainder 27 currencies on a course of deep perspective as non USD currency pairs had to not only match EUR/USD\u2019s break to significant averages but the 1000 pip rise in GBP/USD, 700 for AUD/USD and other non USD currency pairs traded weekly from overbought to overbought and a non normal price circumstance. EUR/USD\u2019s break threw normal price markets deeply off course since August 2020.\n\nNon USD currency pairs such as DXY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY only option since August 2020 was to concur with EUR/USD and non USD rises by trading deeply oversold week to week and to break 5 and 10 year averages.\n\nDXY for example just broke above its 10 year average at 89.95 and contains a long way to travel to the 5 year average at 95.00\u2019s.\n\nToday, markets are ready to slowly embark on a deep 3 and 500 pip correction as currency prices traded to lowest and highest depths of oversold and overbought. This will take time as highlighted in the January 3rd post to long term forecasts because currency prices remain in 3 and 400 pip trading ranges and contained within vital breaks to 5 and 10 year averages. No better time than the present to position for the impending correction.\n\nA correction means a break of 5 and 10 year averages to only trade in new 3 and 400 pip trade ranges as markets and all financial instruments range far more than trend. Consider EUR/USD\u2019s 1000 pip rise from 1.1300 to 1.2300 by 166 pips per month for 6 months.

Watch USD/JPY at 104.72 and trades above while EUR/USD also trades above 1.2030 in a misaligned situation.\n\nGBP/USD and all GBP pairs remain deeply overbought.

Higher EUR/GBP also confirms a lower GBP.\n\nWatch GBP/NZD this week as it trades above 1.9136 while oversold EUR/NZD trades below 1.7011. GBP/NZD is forecast this week as active moves and ranges comply.\n\nOversold USD/CAD 1.2858 should break in days ahead.

The Forex pair was boosted early in the session by another rise in U.S. Treasury yields, but prices retreated when yields dipped slightly from levels not seen in a year.\n\nAt 19:09 GMT, the USD/JPY is trading 105.894, down 0.099 or -0.09%. This is down from a high of 106.224.\n\nIn economic news, data for retail sales in the U.S. in January showed a 5.3% jump. Economists expected retail sales rose by 1.2% after a surprise 0.7% decline in December, according to Dow Jones.\n\nProducer price data for January also came in higher than expected, adding to inflation fears. The Bureau of Labor Statistics saying the 1.3% jump was the highest on record for the index.\n\nLate in the session, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes reaffirmed that the central bank will be keeping policy loose well into the future.\n\nJapan\u2019s Economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter, extending the recovery from its worst postwar recession thanks to a rebound in overseas demand that boosted exports and capital spending.\n\nBut the recovery slowed from the third quarter\u2019s brisk pace and new state of emergency curbs cloud the outlook, underscoring the challenge policymakers face in preventing the spread of COVID-19 without choking off a fragile recovery, especially in the battered consumer sector.\n\nThe world\u2019s third-largest economy grew an annualized 12.7% in October-December, government data showed on Monday, exceeding a median market forecast of 9.5%.\n\nIt was slower than the revised 22.7% surge the previous quarter, when the economy got a lift from pent-up demand after a previous state of emergency was lifted in May.\n\nFor the full coronavirus-stricken year, Japan\u2019s economy contracted 4.8%, the first annual fall since 2009.\n\nBut Japan\u2019s October-December performance was stronger than U.S. growth of 4% and a 2.8% slump in the Euro Zone. With two straight quarters of solid growth, Japan\u2019s economy likely recouped 90% of pandemic-induced losses, analysts say.\n\nConditions are such that Japan will not be able to avoid negative growth in the first quarter,\u201d said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research.\n\n\u201cThere is a high possibility that there will be a repeating cycle of coronavirus infections spreading and being contained this year, which means that consumption is not likely to recover at the expected pace.\u201d\n\n\u201cJapan\u2019s recovery proceeded at a much faster pace than initially expected,\u201d said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still some distance toward a full normalization, but economic activity is recovering toward pre-pandemic levels.\u201d\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our\u00a0economic calendar. \n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  Gold Price Prediction \u2013 Prices Drop Following Robust Retail Sales \n-  Natural Gas Price Fundamental Daily Forecast \u2013 High Demand Remains but Worst of Cold Over for Texas \n-  Oil Price Fundamental Daily Forecast \u2013 Crude Retreats as Stronger US Dollar Eases Foreign Demand \n-  Gold Price Forecast \u2013 Gold Markets Gapped Lower \n-  Natural Gas Price Forecast \u2013 Natural Gas Markets Choppy \n-  USD/CAD Daily Forecast \u2013 Test Of Resistance At 1.2725 \n"}, {"headline": "USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Continues to Push Higher Against Yen", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/0skUPcMMKxztC8EHH8GN3Q--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/3f35505a5b806735187989813881917e", "auther": "Christopher Lewis", "body": "The US dollar has initially pulled back during the trading session on Wednesday but has found plenty of buyers underneath the \u00a5106 level to bounce a bit and show signs of life. Ultimately, this is a pair that is highly influenced by the 10 year note differential between the two countries. With the United States showing higher rates as of late, it makes quite a bit of sense that we would continue to see the US dollar gain in general, and I think that short-term pullbacks will continue to attract a certain amount of attention. The biggest problem here is that we are in the midst of a major trend change, and that almost always takes a significant amount of effort.\n\nGiven enough time, we will break out to the upside at this rate, but I think that is probably closer to the \u00a5106.50 level. To the downside I see the 200 day EMA as offering support on any type of pullback, unless of course the interest rate differential starts to close a bit. All things been equal, I do think that this market has quite a bit further to go, as the US dollar has been oversold to begin with, and of course there could be a dollar shortage due to the high amount of demand coming from the commodity trade.\n\nAll things been equal, I think we could go to the \u00a5110 level over the next six months, but this pair is going to be choppy as per usual.

Quasimodo resistance at 1.2149 is seen to the upside, with a break uncovering the 88.6% Fib level at 1.2162 and resistance from 1.2179.\n\nH1 timeframe:\n\nQuasimodo support at 1.2023, a level accompanied by a 127.2% Fib extension at 1.2029, has done a superb job in holding price higher.\n\nThursday\u2019s bullish impetus, as you can see, has landed candle action within a stone\u2019s throw from the 1.21 level and 100-period simple moving average. Moving through here could direct flow to resistance at 1.2132 (a previous Quasimodo support), stationed just south of 1.2150 resistance.\n\nRSI movement, as you can see, climbed above resistance around 54.20/47.05 and retested the upper edge of the base in recent moves, suggesting overbought conditions today.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nBased on current chart studies, 1.21 potentially offers fragile resistance. A H1 breakout above 1.21, therefore, could be interpreted as a bullish cue, targeting H1 resistance at 1.2132, followed by 1.2050 (aligns with H4 Quasimodo resistance at 1.2149).\n\nAUD/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe:\n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves)\n\nJanuary\u2019s half-hearted shooting star candle (often construed as a bearish indication at peaks) has so far failed to seduce sellers. February, as you can see, trades a touch off session highs, up by about 1.7 percent.\n\nThis brings light to 0.8303/0.8082\u2014a supply zone aligning closely with trendline resistance (prior support \u2013 0.4776). In the event sellers regain consciousness, however, long-term demand resides at 0.7029/0.6664 (prior supply).\n\nIn the context of trend (despite the trendline resistance [1.0582] breach in July 2020), the primary downtrend (since mid-2011) remains in play until breaking 0.8135 (January high [2018]).\n\nDaily timeframe:\n\nPartly modified from previous analysis \u2013\n\nAUD/USD bulls modestly stepped forward on Thursday, snapping a two-day bearish phase.\n\nUpriver, beyond 2021 pinnacles at 0.7820, supply inhabits the 0.7937/0.7890 neighbourhood. Calling for attention to the downside, on the other hand, is trendline support, an ascending level drawn from the low 0.5506.\n\nRSI flow remains flirting with trendline resistance. A downside move here has the 50.00 centreline in sight, while moves north could have the value invade overbought space.\n\nH4 timeframe: \n\nCurrent flow is seen fluctuating between resistance parked at 0.7769 and drop-base-rally demand at around the 0.7727ish region (green).\n\nOutside of this range, support at 0.7698 can be found, a previous Quasimodo resistance, while a bullish play may target resistance drawn from 0.7805.\n\nH1 timeframe: \n\nH4 resistance mentioned above at 0.7769 recently made an entrance, following an earlier push off session troughs, movement that took on 0.7750 resistance and the 100-period simple moving average. A H1 close north of 0.7771 could spark a bullish theme to 0.78, despite a nearby Quasimodo resistance plotted at 0.7782.\n\nRSI followers may also note the value climbed the 50.00 centreline, implying upside momentum is to the upside and could continue to overbought territory.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nMonthly and daily timeframes displaying scope to attack higher levels places a question mark on H4 resistance from 0.7769. A H1 close above the latter could have breakout buyers make a show, with 0.78 (H1) targeted, set just south of H4 resistance at 0.7805.\n\nUSD/JPY:\n\nMonthly timeframe: \n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves) \n\nBuyers are beginning to show life on the monthly scale, following January\u2019s bullish engulfing candle.\n\nUp by 1 percent, descending resistance (not considered traditional trendline resistance) takes the spotlight to the upside, etched from the high 118.66, whereas support inhabits 101.70.\n\nDaily timeframe: \n\nPartly modified from previous analysis \u2013\n\nThursday extended Wednesday\u2019s retracement out of supply from 106.33/105.78, consequently throwing light on the nearby 200-day simple moving average at 105.51.\n\nThe RSI indicator recently produced bearish divergence off overbought territory. Support remains on the table around 57.00.\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nPartly modified from previous analysis \u2013\n\nThe October 7 (2020) peak at 106.11 made a show Wednesday and, as you can see, stimulated a bearish response that extended into Thursday\u2019s session.\n\nDemand remains in sight at 105.26/105.41 and 105.26/105.14 (commonly referred to as stacked demand), while should buyers eventually overthrow 106.11, a 127.2% Fib projection at 106.44 is in view, shadowed by Quasimodo resistance at 106.58.\n\nH1 timeframe:\n\nTechnical framework on the H1 scale shows price grinding towards the 100-period simple moving average at 105.61, with a break shining light on a neighbouring trendline support, taken from the low 104.41.\n\nUpside, we can see the 106 figure, shadowed by two nearby Quasimodo resistances at 106.09 and 106.27.\n\nRSI fans will note the value is circling a 50.00 support area.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nLargely unchanged outlook.\n\nThe reaction from daily supply at 106.33/105.78 might tempt sellers to extend the unit lower and retest the 200-day simple moving average around 105.51. Given the monthly timeframe\u2019s bullish position right now (see above), a dip to the SMA could spark a bullish theme. Note the SMA also coincides closely with H4 demand at 105.26/105.41 and H1 trendline support.\n\nGBP/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe: \n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves) \n\nFollowing December\u2019s 2.5 percent advance\u2014movement that stirred major trendline resistance (2.1161)\u2014February has refreshed multi-month highs at 1.3985.\n\nIn terms of trend structure, however, the primary trend has faced lower since early 2008, unbroken (as of current price) until 1.4376 gives way\u2014April high, 2018. In effect, the aforesaid high represents the next upside objective on the monthly chart.\n\nDaily timeframe: \n\nSterling nudged higher against the dollar Thursday amidst successful COVID-19 vaccinations across the UK. As you can see, this placed supply at 1.3996/1.3918 under pressure.\n\nNorth of supply we can see we have resistance parked at 1.4011, a previous Quasimodo support base (red).\n\nRSI action remains teasing the upper edge of a 3-month range between support around 47.00 and resistance at the 66.00 region, testing overbought territory.\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nFor those who read previous analysis you may recall the following (italics):\n\nEarly hours Tuesday witnessed price movement puncture the upper side of supply from 1.3942/1.3900 (glued to the lower side of daily supply at 1.3996/1.3918). With many price action traders likely to view this as a bullish cue (sellers consumed at supply), dip-buying could emerge off support from 1.3852. \n\nAs evident from the chart, 1.3852 served well as support and has indeed taken on supply from 1.3942/1.3900, which has brought light to another supply at 1.4034/1.3989 (fastened to the upper side of daily supply mentioned above at 1.3996/1.3918 which also houses daily resistance at 1.4011).\n\nH1 timeframe: \n\nUpside gained speed heading into London hours on Thursday, overriding the 100-period simple moving average, the 1.39 figure and 1.3951 tops.\n\nUltimately, what this has done is throw the key figure 1.40 into the realms of possibility, a psychological barrier aligning with a 100% Fib extension at 1.4022 and a 127.2% Fib projection from 1.3996. Therefore, this is likely to be on the radar for many GBP/USD traders today.\n\nRSI flow has recently exited overbought territory, following a peak at 79.87.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nThe 1.40 figure on the H1 and associated Fib levels is likely to not only interest sellers, but it may also be a logical upside target for longs. Also of interest is 1.40 unites closely with daily resistance at 1.4011 and H4 supply parked at 1.4034/1.3989.\n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nThe information contained in this material is intended for general advice only.

In one fell swoop, we punched back through the 100-period simple moving average and shook hands with 1.21, which, as you can see, has served well as support during US trading.\n\nDownstream, aside from H4 support priced at 1.2087, H1 demand resides close by at 1.2078/1.2062.\n\nOut of the RSI oscillator, the value bottomed north of oversold terrain and is on course to cross swords with the lower side of a resistance zone between 47.05 and 54.20.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nOutlook mostly unchanged due to lacklustre performance \u2013 \n\nMonthly price continues to express interest in higher levels, which may eventually motivate daily buyers.\n\nA short-term support zone forged on the H1 timeframe (green) between the upper side of demand at 1.2078 and the 1.21 figure (between the area, H4 support is plotted at 1.2087), therefore, could attract a bullish scenario today and take the currency pair north of the 100-period simple moving average.\n\nAUD/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe:\n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves)\n\nJanuary\u2019s half-hearted shooting star candle (often construed as a bearish indication at peaks) has so far failed to seduce sellers. February, as you can see, trades a touch off session highs, up by about 1.6 percent.\n\nThis brings light to 0.8303/0.8082\u2014a supply zone aligning closely with trendline resistance (prior support \u2013 0.4776). In the event sellers regain consciousness, however, long-term demand resides at 0.7029/0.6664 (prior supply).\n\nIn the context of trend (despite the trendline resistance [1.0582] breach in July 2020), the primary downtrend (since mid-2011) remains in play until breaking 0.8135 (January high [2018]).\n\nDaily timeframe:\n\nThe Australian dollar found itself under pressure against a broadly stronger US dollar (DXY > 90.50) on Tuesday, establishing what many candlestick enthusiasts refer to as a bearish outside reversal.\n\nUpriver, beyond 2021 pinnacles at 0.7820, supply inhabits the 0.7937/0.7890 neighbourhood. Calling for attention to the downside, on the other hand, is trendline support, an ascending level drawn from the low 0.5506.\n\nRSI flow is seen touching gloves with RSI trendline resistance. A downside move here has the 50.00 centreline in sight, while moves north could have the value invade overbought space.\n\nH4 timeframe: \n\nResistance at 0.7805 made an entrance in the early hours of trade on Tuesday, ultimately guiding price action through support at 0.7769.\n\nAs evident from the chart, 0.7769 currently serves as resistance and could ultimately lead things back towards support at 0.7698, a previous Quasimodo resistance. Note, however, that a bullish defence could also emerge around the 0.7727ish region (green \u2013 a drop-base-rally demand zone).\n\nH1 timeframe: \n\nTuesday\u2019s depreciation directed intraday flow south of 0.78 on Tuesday, movement that tested the mettle of 0.7750 support and a nearby 100-period simple moving average.\n\nWith RSI flow dipping through a relatively long-standing trendline support, taken from the low 23.72, and space for sellers to stretch their legs south of 0.7750 to at least Quasimodo support from 0.7719 (followed by 0.77), a short-term bearish scene could emerge sub 0.7750.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nShort term, a H1 close below 0.7750 is likely to stir a bearish theme towards 0.77 on the H1 (H1 Quasimodo support is potentially fragile having seen the level tested last Friday).\n\nLonger term, the monthly chart shows buyers are likely to eventually take the wheel, though prior to this, daily action could retreat and retest trendline support, perhaps inspiring a wave of dip-buying.\n\nUSD/JPY:\n\nMonthly timeframe: \n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves) \n\nBuyers are beginning to show life on the monthly scale, following January\u2019s bullish engulfing candle.\n\nUp by 1.3 percent, resistance can be seen in the form of a descending line (not considered traditional trendline resistance), etched from the high 118.66, whereas support continues to inhabit 101.70 in the event sellers make a show.\n\nDaily timeframe: \n\nNotably, price action on the daily chart made its way above the 200-day simple moving average at 105.53 yesterday, registering a fifth successive daily advance and testing the walls of supply coming in from 106.33/105.78.\n\nBreaking north of a 200-day simple moving average is generally interpreted as a bullish indication, a move that may tempt buyers to take on the aforementioned supply and reach for another layer of supply arranged at 107.58/106.85.\n\nThe RSI indicator is seen edging its way back into overbought territory and also possibly bringing bearish divergence to the table.\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nIn line with the US dollar index staging a strong bullish show and the 10-year US Treasury yield puncturing 1.30 percent, USD/JPY bulls pressed higher from demand at 105.26/105.14 (previous supply).\n\nThe October 7 (2020) peak at 106.11 is next on tap, in terms of resistance, with a break unmasking a 127.2% Fib projection at 106.44, shadowed by Quasimodo resistance at 106.58.\n\nH1 timeframe:\n\nRecent bullish flow, as you can see on the H1 chart, saw the unit topple a number of resistances, including psychological resistance at 106.\n\nAssuming buyers maintain a bullish presence above 106, this could stir interest to Quasimodo resistance at 106.27.\n\nThe RSI indicator, as you might expect in view of the upside movement since last week, continues to explore overbought territory. Notice that support also formed around the 44.00ish range, a common scenario in a rising market.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nWith H1 visibly retesting 106 as support, following an earlier breach, this suggests H4 may attempt to overthrow the October 7 (2020) peak at 106.11. Fuelled on the back of monthly price striving for higher levels, this could have intraday flow draw towards Quasimodo resistance at 106.27 on the H1, followed by the H4 127.2% Fib projection at 106.44.\n\nGBP/USD:\n\nMonthly timeframe: \n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves) \n\nFollowing December\u2019s 2.5 percent advance\u2014movement that stirred major trendline resistance (2.1161)\u2014February has refreshed multi-month highs at 1.3951.\n\nIn terms of trend structure, however, the primary trend has faced lower since early 2008, unbroken (as of current price) until 1.4376 gives way\u2014April high, 2018. In effect, the aforesaid high represents the next upside objective on the monthly chart.\n\nDaily timeframe: \n\nDespite refreshing 2021 highs on Tuesday, GBP/USD remains testing the spirit of supply at 1.3996/1.3918. Candlestick traders will also note yesterday\u2019s action forged an indecision candle, which could, given the market trending higher since 2020, be interpreted as a bearish cue. Essentially, though, buyers and sellers are in a standoff.\n\nSupport on the daily scale can be seen at 1.3755.\n\nRSI action recently broke above the upper edge of a 3-month range between support around 47.00 and resistance at the 66.00 region (the value stands at 67.67), and is on the verge of entering overbought territory.\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nEarly hours Tuesday witnessed price movement puncture the upper side of supply from 1.3942/1.3900 (glued to the lower side of daily supply at 1.3996/1.3918). With many price action traders likely to view this as a bullish cue (sellers consumed at supply), dip-buying could emerge off support from 1.3852.\n\nIt should also be noted that a dip below 1.3852 could send price back to demand at 1.3761/1.3789.\n\nH1 timeframe: \n\nTechnical studies derived from the H1 chart reveal price action tracking ground south of the 1.39 figure, which could see the pair embrace trendline support, taken from the low 1.3566, fixed together with a nearby 100-period simple moving average.\n\nA test of the aforesaid trendline support, however, could also bring about a whipsaw to neighbouring support at 1.3850.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nThe monthly timeframe eyeing 1.4376, in addition to H4 price recently testing the upper edge of supply at 1.3942/1.3900, potentially shines the technical spotlight on H1 trendline support as a possible platform buyers may be attracted to.\n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nThe information contained in this material is intended for general advice only.

Yes, against the low-yielding Japanese Yen, the U.S. Dollar is the riskier asset. The Yen is also falling against the Euro, Aussie and Swiss Franc.\n\nAt 09:21 GMT, the USD/JPY is trading 105.373, up 0.006 or 0.01%.\n\nThe positive outlook for the U.S. economy continues to support financial market sentiment thanks to sharp gains in crude oil prices and optimism over better growth ahead due to the impressive roll-out of COVID vaccines.\n\nJapan\u2019s tertiary activity declined for the second straight month in December, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed on Tuesday. The tertiary activity index fell 0.4% month-on-month in December, following a 0.6% decrease in November.\n\nAmong the individual components, living and amusement-related services, financial and insurance, transport and postal activities, real estate, business-related services, and goods rental and leasing grew in December.\n\nMedical, health care and welfare, wholesale trade, electricity, gas, heat supply and water, retail trade, flat industries, and information and communications decreased.\n\nOn a yearly basis, the tertiary activity index declined 3.6% in December, following a 3.7% slide in the previous month.\n\nHelping to support the USD/JPY is the widening spread between U.S. Government bond yields and Japanese Government bond yields, which is making the U.S. Dollar a more attractive investment.\n\nThe 30-year U.S. Treasury yield held above the 2% market on Tuesday morning, as U.S. markets reopened followed President\u2019s Day.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed to 1.232% at 08:45 GMT, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 2.029%. Yields move inversely to prices.\n\nTreasury yields were higher as investors continued to watch for progress on President Joe Biden\u2019s proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package in Congress, as well as the coronavirus vaccine rollout in the United States.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dollar/Yen traders will continue to focus on the movement in Treasury yields, which will largely be influenced by progress toward turning Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus package into law.\n\nEconomic data, Fed speakers and Treasury auctions could also set the tone. February data from the New York Empire State manufacturing index is due out at 13:30 GMT.\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman is expected to speak at the American Bankers Association

"auther": "Thomas Westwater", "body": "Wall Street saw red across the board on Thursday as the economic recovery picture took a hit following a worse-than-expected US initial jobless claims figure crossed the wires at 861k for the week ending February 13. Analysts were expecting 765k. Continuing claims also missed expectations at 4494k. The small-cap Russell 2000 index dropped 1.67%, followed by the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500, and Dow Jones at -0.72%, -0.44%, and -0.38%, respectively. \n\nThe US 10-year Treasury yield climbed back near its recent multi-month high from earlier this week, with the current level just below 1.300%. Meanwhile, the US Dollar weakened with the DXY index falling nearly half a percentage point. The softer USD didn\u2019t help gold and silver prices, however. XAU/USD was barely changed as it hovered near multi-month support. Silver prices fell against the Greenback, with XAG/USD dropping 1.29%\n\nElsewhere, lawmakers on Capitol Hill continued to move forward with finalizing President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus relief package, which is expected to advance through Congress by the end of this month. Talks over a separate infrastructure bill are also now on the radar after President Biden met with labor union leaders earlier this week. \n\nThe need for a stimulus bill has also gained steam following the failure of the Texas\u2019s power grid after a massive storm system caused chaos across the United States earlier this week. Nearly half a million customers in the Lone Star State are reportedly without power still. There was testimony on Capitol Hill over the recent GameStop market blunder. \n\nChart created with TradingView \n\nEquity indexes across the APAC region look set to open lower, in line with the performance seen on Wall Street. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index (HSI) fell 1.58% on Thursday and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 lost 0.19%. Elsewhere, Chinese markets managed to move mostly higher on the first day trading after the Lunar New Year break, with the Shanghai Composite rising 0.55%. \n\nThe rise seen in Treasury yields may pressure equity prices as higher rates attract more risk-averse investors away from stocks. Debate over a correction in equities is moving into the forefront of market discussions as of late, which now appears more likely given the multi-month highs seen in long-dated US government bond yields. \n\nRisk-sensitive currencies such as the Aussie-Dollar and New Zealand Dollar are on the move higher, bolstered by the broad weakness seen in the Greenback. The Australian Dollar received a slight sentiment boost from a better-than-expected jobs report earlier this week. The Kiwi is also trending higher on USD weakness. According to the DailyFX Economic Calendar, Australian retail sales will cross the wires today, with analysts expecting a 2.0% m/m print. \n\nThe New Zealand Dollar may be set to extend higher from its current level against the US Dollar in the coming days. However, overhead resistance from a descending trendline off the January highs may test any move higher. To the downside, the 50-day Simple Moving Average \u2013 which offered support earlier this week \u2013 is a likely area of support. Moreover, the MACD oscillator appears to be on the verge of making a bullish cross above its center line. \n\nChart created with TradingView\n\n--- Written by Thomas Westwater, Analyst for DailyFX.com\n\nTo contact Thomas, use the comments section below or @FxWestwateron Twitter\n"}, {"headline": "Silver Prices May Continue Outpacing Gold Despite Rising Inflation Bets", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/IXnw29oWtHNTcczb0AbaoQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/44af067070fb8cae555adf7b24ae3254", "auther": "Thomas Westwater", "body": "Gold prices fell Wednesday after US retail sales for January crushed expectations. The upbeat economic data pushed the US Dollar higher which acted to the detriment of gold and other precious metals such as silver. Treasury yields pulled back from their recent pre-pandemic highs. The 10-year yield hit 1.331% before moving lower. \n\nInvestors are ditching government debt concerns as President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus package moves closer to reality. House lawmakers are finalizing the relief package, with a vote expected next week, according to sources cited by the New York Times. While Republicans have pushed back against the package's dollar amount, Democrats appear to have a path to pass the enormous package.\n\nIn line with conventional economic theory, the expected increase in fiscal support is translating to higher inflation bets. However, gold prices \u2013 which typically act as an inflation hedge \u2013 have not risen as the reflation theme gains steam. In fact, XAU/USD is looking to break multi-month lows if the current trend continues. \n\nThe correlation between gold and inflation expectations broke down in early November. One doesn\u2019t have to dive into nuanced economic theory to search out possible explanations for the decoupling. One possible reason is that investors are betting that the economic rebound will benefit other assets, such as equities and industry-related commodities, versus gold regardless of rising inflation bets. \n\nThe attitude is demonstrable among various asset classes. Silver highlights investors\u2019 propensity to find returns among precious metals inclined to benefit most from an accelerating economy. Per the above chart, November highlights gold\u2019s breakdown versus inflation bets. That decoupling appeared when President Joe Biden's election victory became clear. It should also be noted that precious metals, like gold and silver, are non-yield assets. Rising Treasury rates are slowly eating away at XAU and XAG\u2019s advantage in a practically zero-interest-rate environment.\n\nThat said, silver prices have continued to track alongside increasing inflation bets. One likely reason is the higher reliance on silver as an industrial metal. While gold has applications, silver is used more heavily in manufacturing and industry. Hence silver\u2019s outperformance versus gold since November. Investors are laser-focused on the economic rebound and those assets which will benefit most from the recovery. Inflation is likely well on its way but gold isn\u2019t listening, at least for now.  \n\n--- Written by Thomas Westwater, Analyst for DailyFX.com\n\nTo contact Thomas, use the comments section below

At that level, the pivot point one-week S3 and pivot point one-day S2 coincide.\n\n\n\nThe TCI (Technical Confluences Indicator) is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a\u00a0congestion of indicators, moving averages, Fibonacci levels, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "New Zealand Dollar Forecast: NZD/USD May Climb Despite Rising Treasury Yields", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/pXRF.ixTfI9lihFGziPtww--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/e1047526a2fdc0524b0e35c20e30509a", "auther": "Thomas Westwater", "body": "Wall Street saw red across the board on Thursday as the economic recovery picture took a hit following a worse-than-expected US initial jobless claims figure crossed the wires at 861k for the week ending February 13. Analysts were expecting 765k. Continuing claims also missed expectations at 4494k. The small-cap Russell 2000 index dropped 1.67%, followed by the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500, and Dow Jones at -0.72%, -0.44%, and -0.38%, respectively. \n\nThe US 10-year Treasury yield climbed back near its recent multi-month high from earlier this week, with the current level just below 1.300%. Meanwhile, the US Dollar weakened with the DXY index falling nearly half a percentage point. The softer USD didn\u2019t help gold and silver prices, however. XAU/USD was barely changed as it hovered near multi-month support. Silver prices fell against the Greenback, with XAG/USD dropping 1.29%\n\nElsewhere, lawmakers on Capitol Hill continued to move forward with finalizing President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus relief package, which is expected to advance through Congress by the end of this month. Talks over a separate infrastructure bill are also now on the radar after President Biden met with labor union leaders earlier this week. \n\nThe need for a stimulus bill has also gained steam following the failure of the Texas\u2019s power grid after a massive storm system caused chaos across the United States earlier this week. Nearly half a million customers in the Lone Star State are reportedly without power still. There was testimony on Capitol Hill over the recent GameStop market blunder. \n\nChart created with TradingView \n\nEquity indexes across the APAC region look set to open lower, in line with the performance seen on Wall Street. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index (HSI) fell 1.58% on Thursday and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 lost 0.19%. Elsewhere, Chinese markets managed to move mostly higher on the first day trading after the Lunar New Year break, with the Shanghai Composite rising 0.55%. \n\nThe rise seen in Treasury yields may pressure equity prices as higher rates attract more risk-averse investors away from stocks. Debate over a correction in equities is moving into the forefront of market discussions as of late, which now appears more likely given the multi-month highs seen in long-dated US government bond yields. \n\nRisk-sensitive currencies such as the Aussie-Dollar and New Zealand Dollar are on the move higher, bolstered by the broad weakness seen in the Greenback. The Australian Dollar received a slight sentiment boost from a better-than-expected jobs report earlier this week. The Kiwi is also trending higher on USD weakness. According to the DailyFX Economic Calendar, Australian retail sales will cross the wires today, with analysts expecting a 2.0% m/m print. \n\nThe New Zealand Dollar may be set to extend higher from its current level against the US Dollar in the coming days. However, overhead resistance from a descending trendline off the January highs may test any move higher. To the downside, the 50-day Simple Moving Average \u2013 which offered support earlier this week \u2013 is a likely area of support. Moreover, the MACD oscillator appears to be on the verge of making a bullish cross above its center line. \n\nChart created with TradingView\n\n--- Written by Thomas Westwater, Analyst for DailyFX.com\n\nTo contact Thomas, use the comments section below or @FxWestwateron Twitter\n"}, {"headline": "Gold Price Forecast: Path of least resistance remains to the downside for XAU/USD", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/YS3kzMF52gukxr2X0a1XhA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/c9e695a0071b4b345622f6eefb72d2f7", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Gold broke below the $1800 mark on Tuesday and was pressured by a combination of factors. The progress on COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and the slowing pace of infections has been fueling optimism over a quick global economic recovery from the pandemic. This, along with expectations for a massive US fiscal spending plan, continued boosting investors' confidence and was seen as one of the key factors that undermined demand for the safe-haven precious metal.\n\nThe market continued to price in the prospects for the passage of the US President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The reflation traded pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond to the highest level since February 2020, around 1.30%. A runaway rally in the US Treasury bond yields was seen as another factor that delivered a fatal blow to the non-yielding yellow metal and contributed to the steep intraday fall.\n\nMeanwhile, surging US Treasury bond yields assisted the US dollar to rebound swiftly from three-week lows. The USD was further supported by Tuesday's upbeat Empire State Manufacturing Index, which jumped to 12.1 in February from 3.5 previous and portrayed an upbeat picture for the US economy. The XAU/USD finally settled near the lower end of its daily trading range and dropped to $1887-86 region, back closer to monthly swing lows during the Asian session on Wednesday.\n\nThe bearish pressure seems to have abated, at least for the time being, though the near-term bias remains tilted firmly in favour of bearish traders. The USD could gain some follow-through traction if bond yields continue to rally, which, in turn, should act as a fresh bearish catalyst and pave the way for further weakness. Traders might further take cues from Wednesday's release of the US monthly Retail Sales figures, due later during the early North American session. Apart from this, the broader market risk sentiment will also play a key role in influencing the commodity.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the metal, for now, seems to have found some support near a short-term ascending trend-line. A subsequent drop below the $1785 area (monthly lows) will reaffirm the near-term bearish bias and pave the way for a further depreciating move towards extending from November 2020 swing lows support, around the $1764 region. The downward trajectory could further get extended towards the $1739-37 horizontal support.\n\nOn the flip side, any meaningful recovery attempt beyond the $1800 mark might now be seen as a selling opportunity and runs the risk of fizzling out rather quickly near the $1808-10 region. That said, some follow-through buying might trigger a short-covering move and push the commodity further towards the overnight swing highs, around the $1825-27 supply zone.\n\n\n"}]}]
