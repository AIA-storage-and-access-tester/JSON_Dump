"auther": "Thomas Niel ", "body": "As you likely know, overheated cryptocurrencies have take a breather in recent days. This includes Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), which after hitting prices topping $2,000, has since pulled back more than 20%. Has the \u201cbubble\u201d that has sent this, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), and other cryptos to record highs popped? Or, is the market for this alternative asset class simply taking a breather?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell. Like I said in a recent article on Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD), it\u2019s unclear whether the recent enthusiasm for cryptos is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the 1600s Dutch Tulip Bubble. Bulls want to make the case that \u201cthis time, it\u2019s different.\u201d But, in past bubbles, has that ever been the case?\n\nYes, the big inflows of corporate and institutional money support the narrative that cryptos are headed to higher prices. But, so far,\u00a0 these big inflows have been mostly into Bitcoin. It\u2019s a long road ahead until the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to seriously look at Ethereum as a store of value.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the best play now, as cryptos try to recover their recent losses? Hold off for now. With factors in play that could fuel further declines, a better entry point may be just down the road.\n\nThere\u2019s much to be said about this crypto\u2019s bona fides when it comes to utility. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Josh Enomoto wrote Feb. 17, Ethereum solves many of the pain points that come with using Bitcoin in transactions. Add in other features like smart contracts and stake mining protocols, and this crypto offers much greater utility than the most popular crypto on the block.\n\nGreater utility may point to its wide scale adoption in financial transactions. But, will it translate into higher prices? Possibly, but it depends on whether the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to appreciate it as a store of value.\n\nSo far, Bitcoin has been where institutional money is allocated. There have been reports of institutional buying of Ether (the name of the coin itself, Ethereum refers to the platform). However, we have yet to see big corporate buyers of Bitcoin, like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), Square (NYSE:SQ), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) diversify into this particular crypto.\n\nThe \u201csmart money\u201d may be accelerating their pivot towards cryptocurrencies. But, it may take some time for them to embrace Ethereum as a store of value. This could mean opportunity for those buying today, ahead of this leading \u201caltcoin\u201d finally becoming a major holding of institutional crypto investors. Yet, that alone doesn\u2019t mean now\u2019s the time to buy. With the risk crypto prices continue to fall, there may be a more opportune entry point down the road.\n\nLike I said a few weeks back, it seems most are buying Ethereum, not for its utility, but for its potential to become as valuable as Bitcoin. This event, coined by some as \u201cthe flippening,\u201d may eventually happen. But, buying ETH now, for this reason, may not be the best move. Why? It\u2019s still early to tell whether the recent pullback is the market taking the breather, or the start of the crypto bubble bursting.\n\nBoth popular cryptos have started to bounce back. Yet, there\u2019s plenty in motion to support further moves lower. A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted several of these factors. These include the increased odds of the economy getting over the pandemic this year, rising interest rates, and recent negative remarks about Bitcoin by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nYellen is not the only prominent economic figure who has made negative remarks about cryptocurrencies in recent days. Nouriel Roubini, aka \u201cDr Doom\u201d (for his overall bearish views) recently made the case why Bitcoin is a \u201cpseudo-asset,\u201d adding that it\u2019s highly correlated with stocks, and not a hedge against inflation.\n\nWhile these remarks were specifically about Bitcoin, much of it applies to Ethereum as well. If interest in cryptocurrencies fades due to these aforementioned factors, it\u2019s more than likely that Ethereum will continue to fall back towards prior price levels.\n\nWith this in mind, it may make more sense to take your time before entering a long-term position.\n\nEthereum is interesting in the long-term, but not so much in the short-term.\n\nPreviously, I was more bearish on Ethereum. As I learn more about its advantages over Bitcoin, I agree that it could continue to appreciate in value over the next few years. But, that doesn\u2019t mean I see now as the best time to enter a position.\n\nWith the risk the overheated crypto market pulls back further, take your time before entering a position in Ethereum.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum May Become a Corporate Treasury Asset", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin. Look for Ethereum to continue to outperform Bitcoin over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000, Setting A New All-Time High | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Crypto BriefingCryptocurrency", "body": "Ethereum's ascent continues.

ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time.

There\u2019s over $43 billion locked in DeFi protocols today, according to DeFi Pulse. Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021. Described as an ETH buyback mechanism by EIP-1559 Tim Beiko, the update will see gas fees get burned to reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is now $232.8 billion.\n\nOriginal Post\n"}, {"headline": "Tread Carefully, but Stellar Lumens May Have More Room to Run", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jDGEk7m07GGEvjcDeE4_KQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/c29b5e8f640f2124ee5501dc12ec92d4", "auther": "Thomas Niel ", "body": "With cryptocurrencies once again popular among investors, it\u2019s no surprise the price of Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) continues to climb. Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Latest Ethereum price and analysis (ETH to USD)", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Coin Rivet via Yahoo Finance", "date": "14 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/6enipzxTWF0OnhgQlrlEug--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coin_rivet_596/04fea6b3926e5c528055f1c4d64a2f66", "auther": "Oliver Knight", "body": "Ethereum is currently trading at $1,629 following a rollercoaster week of price action that has seen it fluctuate within a $400 range.\n\nThe week began with a dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015.

Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this

"auther": "Thomas Niel ", "body": "As you likely know, overheated cryptocurrencies have take a breather in recent days. This includes Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), which after hitting prices topping $2,000, has since pulled back more than 20%. Has the \u201cbubble\u201d that has sent this, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), and other cryptos to record highs popped? Or, is the market for this alternative asset class simply taking a breather?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell. Like I said in a recent article on Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD), it\u2019s unclear whether the recent enthusiasm for cryptos is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the 1600s Dutch Tulip Bubble. Bulls want to make the case that \u201cthis time, it\u2019s different.\u201d But, in past bubbles, has that ever been the case?\n\nYes, the big inflows of corporate and institutional money support the narrative that cryptos are headed to higher prices. But, so far,\u00a0 these big inflows have been mostly into Bitcoin. It\u2019s a long road ahead until the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to seriously look at Ethereum as a store of value.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the best play now, as cryptos try to recover their recent losses? Hold off for now. With factors in play that could fuel further declines, a better entry point may be just down the road.\n\nThere\u2019s much to be said about this crypto\u2019s bona fides when it comes to utility. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Josh Enomoto wrote Feb. 17, Ethereum solves many of the pain points that come with using Bitcoin in transactions. Add in other features like smart contracts and stake mining protocols, and this crypto offers much greater utility than the most popular crypto on the block.\n\nGreater utility may point to its wide scale adoption in financial transactions. But, will it translate into higher prices? Possibly, but it depends on whether the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to appreciate it as a store of value.\n\nSo far, Bitcoin has been where institutional money is allocated. There have been reports of institutional buying of Ether (the name of the coin itself, Ethereum refers to the platform). However, we have yet to see big corporate buyers of Bitcoin, like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), Square (NYSE:SQ), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) diversify into this particular crypto.\n\nThe \u201csmart money\u201d may be accelerating their pivot towards cryptocurrencies. But, it may take some time for them to embrace Ethereum as a store of value. This could mean opportunity for those buying today, ahead of this leading \u201caltcoin\u201d finally becoming a major holding of institutional crypto investors. Yet, that alone doesn\u2019t mean now\u2019s the time to buy. With the risk crypto prices continue to fall, there may be a more opportune entry point down the road.\n\nLike I said a few weeks back, it seems most are buying Ethereum, not for its utility, but for its potential to become as valuable as Bitcoin. This event, coined by some as \u201cthe flippening,\u201d may eventually happen. But, buying ETH now, for this reason, may not be the best move. Why? It\u2019s still early to tell whether the recent pullback is the market taking the breather, or the start of the crypto bubble bursting.\n\nBoth popular cryptos have started to bounce back. Yet, there\u2019s plenty in motion to support further moves lower. A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted several of these factors. These include the increased odds of the economy getting over the pandemic this year, rising interest rates, and recent negative remarks about Bitcoin by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nYellen is not the only prominent economic figure who has made negative remarks about cryptocurrencies in recent days. Nouriel Roubini, aka \u201cDr Doom\u201d (for his overall bearish views) recently made the case why Bitcoin is a \u201cpseudo-asset,\u201d adding that it\u2019s highly correlated with stocks, and not a hedge against inflation.\n\nWhile these remarks were specifically about Bitcoin, much of it applies to Ethereum as well. If interest in cryptocurrencies fades due to these aforementioned factors, it\u2019s more than likely that Ethereum will continue to fall back towards prior price levels.\n\nWith this in mind, it may make more sense to take your time before entering a long-term position.\n\nEthereum is interesting in the long-term, but not so much in the short-term.\n\nPreviously, I was more bearish on Ethereum. As I learn more about its advantages over Bitcoin, I agree that it could continue to appreciate in value over the next few years. But, that doesn\u2019t mean I see now as the best time to enter a position.\n\nWith the risk the overheated crypto market pulls back further, take your time before entering a position in Ethereum.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum May Become a Corporate Treasury Asset", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin. Look for Ethereum to continue to outperform Bitcoin over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000, Setting A New All-Time High | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Crypto BriefingCryptocurrency", "body": "Ethereum's ascent continues.

It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Latest Ethereum price and analysis (ETH to USD)", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Coin Rivet via Yahoo Finance", "date": "14 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/6enipzxTWF0OnhgQlrlEug--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coin_rivet_596/04fea6b3926e5c528055f1c4d64a2f66", "auther": "Oliver Knight", "body": "Ethereum is currently trading at $1,629 following a rollercoaster week of price action that has seen it fluctuate within a $400 range.\n\nThe week began with a dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015.

Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this

This includes Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), which after hitting prices topping $2,000, has since pulled back more than 20%. Has the \u201cbubble\u201d that has sent this, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), and other cryptos to record highs popped? Or, is the market for this alternative asset class simply taking a breather?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell. Like I said in a recent article on Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD), it\u2019s unclear whether the recent enthusiasm for cryptos is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the 1600s Dutch Tulip Bubble. Bulls want to make the case that \u201cthis time, it\u2019s different.\u201d But, in past bubbles, has that ever been the case?\n\nYes, the big inflows of corporate and institutional money support the narrative that cryptos are headed to higher prices. But, so far,\u00a0 these big inflows have been mostly into Bitcoin. It\u2019s a long road ahead until the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to seriously look at Ethereum as a store of value.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the best play now, as cryptos try to recover their recent losses? Hold off for now. With factors in play that could fuel further declines, a better entry point may be just down the road.\n\nThere\u2019s much to be said about this crypto\u2019s bona fides when it comes to utility. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Josh Enomoto wrote Feb. 17, Ethereum solves many of the pain points that come with using Bitcoin in transactions. Add in other features like smart contracts and stake mining protocols, and this crypto offers much greater utility than the most popular crypto on the block.\n\nGreater utility may point to its wide scale adoption in financial transactions. But, will it translate into higher prices? Possibly, but it depends on whether the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to appreciate it as a store of value.\n\nSo far, Bitcoin has been where institutional money is allocated. There have been reports of institutional buying of Ether (the name of the coin itself, Ethereum refers to the platform). However, we have yet to see big corporate buyers of Bitcoin, like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), Square (NYSE:SQ), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) diversify into this particular crypto.\n\nThe \u201csmart money\u201d may be accelerating their pivot towards cryptocurrencies. But, it may take some time for them to embrace Ethereum as a store of value. This could mean opportunity for those buying today, ahead of this leading \u201caltcoin\u201d finally becoming a major holding of institutional crypto investors. Yet, that alone doesn\u2019t mean now\u2019s the time to buy. With the risk crypto prices continue to fall, there may be a more opportune entry point down the road.\n\nLike I said a few weeks back, it seems most are buying Ethereum, not for its utility, but for its potential to become as valuable as Bitcoin. This event, coined by some as \u201cthe flippening,\u201d may eventually happen. But, buying ETH now, for this reason, may not be the best move. Why? It\u2019s still early to tell whether the recent pullback is the market taking the breather, or the start of the crypto bubble bursting.\n\nBoth popular cryptos have started to bounce back. Yet, there\u2019s plenty in motion to support further moves lower. A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted several of these factors. These include the increased odds of the economy getting over the pandemic this year, rising interest rates, and recent negative remarks about Bitcoin by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nYellen is not the only prominent economic figure who has made negative remarks about cryptocurrencies in recent days. Nouriel Roubini, aka \u201cDr Doom\u201d (for his overall bearish views) recently made the case why Bitcoin is a \u201cpseudo-asset,\u201d adding that it\u2019s highly correlated with stocks, and not a hedge against inflation.\n\nWhile these remarks were specifically about Bitcoin, much of it applies to Ethereum as well. If interest in cryptocurrencies fades due to these aforementioned factors, it\u2019s more than likely that Ethereum will continue to fall back towards prior price levels.\n\nWith this in mind, it may make more sense to take your time before entering a long-term position.\n\nEthereum is interesting in the long-term, but not so much in the short-term.\n\nPreviously, I was more bearish on Ethereum. As I learn more about its advantages over Bitcoin, I agree that it could continue to appreciate in value over the next few years. But, that doesn\u2019t mean I see now as the best time to enter a position.\n\nWith the risk the overheated crypto market pulls back further, take your time before entering a position in Ethereum.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum May Become a Corporate Treasury Asset", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000, Setting A New All-Time High | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Crypto BriefingCryptocurrency", "body": "Ethereum's ascent continues.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Latest Ethereum price and analysis (ETH to USD)", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Coin Rivet via Yahoo Finance", "date": "14 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/6enipzxTWF0OnhgQlrlEug--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coin_rivet_596/04fea6b3926e5c528055f1c4d64a2f66", "auther": "Oliver Knight", "body": "Ethereum is currently trading at $1,629 following a rollercoaster week of price action that has seen it fluctuate within a $400 range.\n\nThe week began with a dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015.

Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this

"auther": "Thomas Niel ", "body": "As you likely know, overheated cryptocurrencies have take a breather in recent days. This includes Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), which after hitting prices topping $2,000, has since pulled back more than 20%. Has the \u201cbubble\u201d that has sent this, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), and other cryptos to record highs popped? Or, is the market for this alternative asset class simply taking a breather?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell. Like I said in a recent article on Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD), it\u2019s unclear whether the recent enthusiasm for cryptos is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the 1600s Dutch Tulip Bubble. Bulls want to make the case that \u201cthis time, it\u2019s different.\u201d But, in past bubbles, has that ever been the case?\n\nYes, the big inflows of corporate and institutional money support the narrative that cryptos are headed to higher prices. But, so far,\u00a0 these big inflows have been mostly into Bitcoin. It\u2019s a long road ahead until the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to seriously look at Ethereum as a store of value.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the best play now, as cryptos try to recover their recent losses? Hold off for now. With factors in play that could fuel further declines, a better entry point may be just down the road.\n\nThere\u2019s much to be said about this crypto\u2019s bona fides when it comes to utility. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Josh Enomoto wrote Feb. 17, Ethereum solves many of the pain points that come with using Bitcoin in transactions. Add in other features like smart contracts and stake mining protocols, and this crypto offers much greater utility than the most popular crypto on the block.\n\nGreater utility may point to its wide scale adoption in financial transactions. But, will it translate into higher prices? Possibly, but it depends on whether the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to appreciate it as a store of value.\n\nSo far, Bitcoin has been where institutional money is allocated. There have been reports of institutional buying of Ether (the name of the coin itself, Ethereum refers to the platform). However, we have yet to see big corporate buyers of Bitcoin, like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), Square (NYSE:SQ), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) diversify into this particular crypto.\n\nThe \u201csmart money\u201d may be accelerating their pivot towards cryptocurrencies. But, it may take some time for them to embrace Ethereum as a store of value. This could mean opportunity for those buying today, ahead of this leading \u201caltcoin\u201d finally becoming a major holding of institutional crypto investors. Yet, that alone doesn\u2019t mean now\u2019s the time to buy. With the risk crypto prices continue to fall, there may be a more opportune entry point down the road.\n\nLike I said a few weeks back, it seems most are buying Ethereum, not for its utility, but for its potential to become as valuable as Bitcoin. This event, coined by some as \u201cthe flippening,\u201d may eventually happen. But, buying ETH now, for this reason, may not be the best move. Why? It\u2019s still early to tell whether the recent pullback is the market taking the breather, or the start of the crypto bubble bursting.\n\nBoth popular cryptos have started to bounce back. Yet, there\u2019s plenty in motion to support further moves lower. A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted several of these factors. These include the increased odds of the economy getting over the pandemic this year, rising interest rates, and recent negative remarks about Bitcoin by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nYellen is not the only prominent economic figure who has made negative remarks about cryptocurrencies in recent days. Nouriel Roubini, aka \u201cDr Doom\u201d (for his overall bearish views) recently made the case why Bitcoin is a \u201cpseudo-asset,\u201d adding that it\u2019s highly correlated with stocks, and not a hedge against inflation.\n\nWhile these remarks were specifically about Bitcoin, much of it applies to Ethereum as well. If interest in cryptocurrencies fades due to these aforementioned factors, it\u2019s more than likely that Ethereum will continue to fall back towards prior price levels.\n\nWith this in mind, it may make more sense to take your time before entering a long-term position.\n\nEthereum is interesting in the long-term, but not so much in the short-term.\n\nPreviously, I was more bearish on Ethereum. As I learn more about its advantages over Bitcoin, I agree that it could continue to appreciate in value over the next few years. But, that doesn\u2019t mean I see now as the best time to enter a position.\n\nWith the risk the overheated crypto market pulls back further, take your time before entering a position in Ethereum.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum May Become a Corporate Treasury Asset", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000, Setting A New All-Time High | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Crypto BriefingCryptocurrency", "body": "Ethereum's ascent continues.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Latest Ethereum price and analysis (ETH to USD)", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Coin Rivet via Yahoo Finance", "date": "14 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/6enipzxTWF0OnhgQlrlEug--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coin_rivet_596/04fea6b3926e5c528055f1c4d64a2f66", "auther": "Oliver Knight", "body": "Ethereum is currently trading at $1,629 following a rollercoaster week of price action that has seen it fluctuate within a $400 range.\n\nThe week began with a dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015.

Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this

"auther": "Thomas Niel ", "body": "As you likely know, overheated cryptocurrencies have take a breather in recent days. This includes Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), which after hitting prices topping $2,000, has since pulled back more than 20%. Has the \u201cbubble\u201d that has sent this, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), and other cryptos to record highs popped? Or, is the market for this alternative asset class simply taking a breather?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell. Like I said in a recent article on Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD), it\u2019s unclear whether the recent enthusiasm for cryptos is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the 1600s Dutch Tulip Bubble. Bulls want to make the case that \u201cthis time, it\u2019s different.\u201d But, in past bubbles, has that ever been the case?\n\nYes, the big inflows of corporate and institutional money support the narrative that cryptos are headed to higher prices. But, so far,\u00a0 these big inflows have been mostly into Bitcoin. It\u2019s a long road ahead until the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to seriously look at Ethereum as a store of value.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the best play now, as cryptos try to recover their recent losses? Hold off for now. With factors in play that could fuel further declines, a better entry point may be just down the road.\n\nThere\u2019s much to be said about this crypto\u2019s bona fides when it comes to utility. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Josh Enomoto wrote Feb. 17, Ethereum solves many of the pain points that come with using Bitcoin in transactions. Add in other features like smart contracts and stake mining protocols, and this crypto offers much greater utility than the most popular crypto on the block.\n\nGreater utility may point to its wide scale adoption in financial transactions. But, will it translate into higher prices? Possibly, but it depends on whether the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to appreciate it as a store of value.\n\nSo far, Bitcoin has been where institutional money is allocated. There have been reports of institutional buying of Ether (the name of the coin itself, Ethereum refers to the platform). However, we have yet to see big corporate buyers of Bitcoin, like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), Square (NYSE:SQ), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) diversify into this particular crypto.\n\nThe \u201csmart money\u201d may be accelerating their pivot towards cryptocurrencies. But, it may take some time for them to embrace Ethereum as a store of value. This could mean opportunity for those buying today, ahead of this leading \u201caltcoin\u201d finally becoming a major holding of institutional crypto investors. Yet, that alone doesn\u2019t mean now\u2019s the time to buy. With the risk crypto prices continue to fall, there may be a more opportune entry point down the road.\n\nLike I said a few weeks back, it seems most are buying Ethereum, not for its utility, but for its potential to become as valuable as Bitcoin. This event, coined by some as \u201cthe flippening,\u201d may eventually happen. But, buying ETH now, for this reason, may not be the best move. Why? It\u2019s still early to tell whether the recent pullback is the market taking the breather, or the start of the crypto bubble bursting.\n\nBoth popular cryptos have started to bounce back. Yet, there\u2019s plenty in motion to support further moves lower. A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted several of these factors. These include the increased odds of the economy getting over the pandemic this year, rising interest rates, and recent negative remarks about Bitcoin by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nYellen is not the only prominent economic figure who has made negative remarks about cryptocurrencies in recent days. Nouriel Roubini, aka \u201cDr Doom\u201d (for his overall bearish views) recently made the case why Bitcoin is a \u201cpseudo-asset,\u201d adding that it\u2019s highly correlated with stocks, and not a hedge against inflation.\n\nWhile these remarks were specifically about Bitcoin, much of it applies to Ethereum as well. If interest in cryptocurrencies fades due to these aforementioned factors, it\u2019s more than likely that Ethereum will continue to fall back towards prior price levels.\n\nWith this in mind, it may make more sense to take your time before entering a long-term position.\n\nEthereum is interesting in the long-term, but not so much in the short-term.\n\nPreviously, I was more bearish on Ethereum. As I learn more about its advantages over Bitcoin, I agree that it could continue to appreciate in value over the next few years. But, that doesn\u2019t mean I see now as the best time to enter a position.\n\nWith the risk the overheated crypto market pulls back further, take your time before entering a position in Ethereum.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum May Become a Corporate Treasury Asset", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin. Look for Ethereum to continue to outperform Bitcoin over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000, Setting A New All-Time High | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Crypto BriefingCryptocurrency", "body": "Ethereum's ascent continues.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Latest Ethereum price and analysis (ETH to USD)", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Coin Rivet via Yahoo Finance", "date": "14 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/6enipzxTWF0OnhgQlrlEug--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coin_rivet_596/04fea6b3926e5c528055f1c4d64a2f66", "auther": "Oliver Knight", "body": "Ethereum is currently trading at $1,629 following a rollercoaster week of price action that has seen it fluctuate within a $400 range.\n\nThe week began with a dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn\u2019t get buy-in to his proposal.\n\nIf you want to find out more information about Ethereum or cryptocurrencies in general, then use the search box at the top of this page.

"auther": "Thomas Niel ", "body": "As you likely know, overheated cryptocurrencies have take a breather in recent days. This includes Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), which after hitting prices topping $2,000, has since pulled back more than 20%. Has the \u201cbubble\u201d that has sent this, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), and other cryptos to record highs popped? Or, is the market for this alternative asset class simply taking a breather?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell. Like I said in a recent article on Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD), it\u2019s unclear whether the recent enthusiasm for cryptos is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the 1600s Dutch Tulip Bubble. Bulls want to make the case that \u201cthis time, it\u2019s different.\u201d But, in past bubbles, has that ever been the case?\n\nYes, the big inflows of corporate and institutional money support the narrative that cryptos are headed to higher prices. But, so far,\u00a0 these big inflows have been mostly into Bitcoin. It\u2019s a long road ahead until the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to seriously look at Ethereum as a store of value.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the best play now, as cryptos try to recover their recent losses? Hold off for now. With factors in play that could fuel further declines, a better entry point may be just down the road.\n\nThere\u2019s much to be said about this crypto\u2019s bona fides when it comes to utility. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Josh Enomoto wrote Feb. 17, Ethereum solves many of the pain points that come with using Bitcoin in transactions. Add in other features like smart contracts and stake mining protocols, and this crypto offers much greater utility than the most popular crypto on the block.\n\nGreater utility may point to its wide scale adoption in financial transactions. But, will it translate into higher prices? Possibly, but it depends on whether the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to appreciate it as a store of value.\n\nSo far, Bitcoin has been where institutional money is allocated. There have been reports of institutional buying of Ether (the name of the coin itself, Ethereum refers to the platform). However, we have yet to see big corporate buyers of Bitcoin, like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), Square (NYSE:SQ), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) diversify into this particular crypto.\n\nThe \u201csmart money\u201d may be accelerating their pivot towards cryptocurrencies. But, it may take some time for them to embrace Ethereum as a store of value. This could mean opportunity for those buying today, ahead of this leading \u201caltcoin\u201d finally becoming a major holding of institutional crypto investors. Yet, that alone doesn\u2019t mean now\u2019s the time to buy. With the risk crypto prices continue to fall, there may be a more opportune entry point down the road.\n\nLike I said a few weeks back, it seems most are buying Ethereum, not for its utility, but for its potential to become as valuable as Bitcoin. This event, coined by some as \u201cthe flippening,\u201d may eventually happen. But, buying ETH now, for this reason, may not be the best move. Why? It\u2019s still early to tell whether the recent pullback is the market taking the breather, or the start of the crypto bubble bursting.\n\nBoth popular cryptos have started to bounce back. Yet, there\u2019s plenty in motion to support further moves lower. A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted several of these factors. These include the increased odds of the economy getting over the pandemic this year, rising interest rates, and recent negative remarks about Bitcoin by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nYellen is not the only prominent economic figure who has made negative remarks about cryptocurrencies in recent days. Nouriel Roubini, aka \u201cDr Doom\u201d (for his overall bearish views) recently made the case why Bitcoin is a \u201cpseudo-asset,\u201d adding that it\u2019s highly correlated with stocks, and not a hedge against inflation.\n\nWhile these remarks were specifically about Bitcoin, much of it applies to Ethereum as well. If interest in cryptocurrencies fades due to these aforementioned factors, it\u2019s more than likely that Ethereum will continue to fall back towards prior price levels.\n\nWith this in mind, it may make more sense to take your time before entering a long-term position.\n\nEthereum is interesting in the long-term, but not so much in the short-term.\n\nPreviously, I was more bearish on Ethereum. As I learn more about its advantages over Bitcoin, I agree that it could continue to appreciate in value over the next few years. But, that doesn\u2019t mean I see now as the best time to enter a position.\n\nWith the risk the overheated crypto market pulls back further, take your time before entering a position in Ethereum.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum May Become a Corporate Treasury Asset", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin. Look for Ethereum to continue to outperform Bitcoin over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000, Setting A New All-Time High | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Crypto BriefingCryptocurrency", "body": "Ethereum's ascent continues. The second-ranked crypto just set a new all-time high above $2,000.\n\nEthereum has broken a key psychological resistance barrier at $2,000.\n\nETH has crossed $2,000 for the first time. It\u2019s trading at $2,014 at the time of writing.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nThe digital asset has experienced a violent rise in recent weeks. On Jan. 4, it crossed $1,000 amid a flurry of activity across the crypto markets.\n\nThe run then intensified, with ETH touching $1,430 on Jan. 19, a record high at the time. ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run. ETH often outperforms BTC, however. It\u2019s up roughly 175% year-to-date, while BTC is up 89%.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has also had various wins of its own recently. On Feb. 8, ETH futures launched on CME Group, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange.\n\nThe NFT space, which runs on top of Ethereum, has also enjoyed a boom this year. Several notable celebrities and musicians have piled into the craze, among them Mark Cuban, Logan Paul, and Soulja Boy. This week, iconic auction house Christie\u2019s announced its plans to list an NFT by Beeple. They\u2019ll accept ETH in the auction.\n\nDeFi, meanwhile, continues to grow. There\u2019s over $43 billion locked in DeFi protocols today, according to DeFi Pulse. Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021. Described as an ETH buyback mechanism by EIP-1559 Tim Beiko, the update will see gas fees get burned to reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is now $232.8 billion.\n\nOriginal Post\n"}, {"headline": "Tread Carefully, but Stellar Lumens May Have More Room to Run", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jDGEk7m07GGEvjcDeE4_KQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/c29b5e8f640f2124ee5501dc12ec92d4", "auther": "Thomas Niel ", "body": "With cryptocurrencies once again popular among investors, it\u2019s no surprise the price of Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) continues to climb. Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Latest Ethereum price and analysis (ETH to USD)", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Coin Rivet via Yahoo Finance", "date": "14 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/6enipzxTWF0OnhgQlrlEug--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coin_rivet_596/04fea6b3926e5c528055f1c4d64a2f66", "auther": "Oliver Knight", "body": "Ethereum is currently trading at $1,629 following a rollercoaster week of price action that has seen it fluctuate within a $400 range.\n\nThe week began with a dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015.

"auther": "Thomas Niel ", "body": "As you likely know, overheated cryptocurrencies have take a breather in recent days. This includes Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), which after hitting prices topping $2,000, has since pulled back more than 20%. Has the \u201cbubble\u201d that has sent this, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), and other cryptos to record highs popped? Or, is the market for this alternative asset class simply taking a breather?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell. Like I said in a recent article on Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD), it\u2019s unclear whether the recent enthusiasm for cryptos is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the 1600s Dutch Tulip Bubble. Bulls want to make the case that \u201cthis time, it\u2019s different.\u201d But, in past bubbles, has that ever been the case?\n\nYes, the big inflows of corporate and institutional money support the narrative that cryptos are headed to higher prices. But, so far,\u00a0 these big inflows have been mostly into Bitcoin. It\u2019s a long road ahead until the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to seriously look at Ethereum as a store of value.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the best play now, as cryptos try to recover their recent losses? Hold off for now. With factors in play that could fuel further declines, a better entry point may be just down the road.\n\nThere\u2019s much to be said about this crypto\u2019s bona fides when it comes to utility. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Josh Enomoto wrote Feb. 17, Ethereum solves many of the pain points that come with using Bitcoin in transactions. Add in other features like smart contracts and stake mining protocols, and this crypto offers much greater utility than the most popular crypto on the block.\n\nGreater utility may point to its wide scale adoption in financial transactions. But, will it translate into higher prices? Possibly, but it depends on whether the \u201csmart money\u201d starts to appreciate it as a store of value.\n\nSo far, Bitcoin has been where institutional money is allocated. There have been reports of institutional buying of Ether (the name of the coin itself, Ethereum refers to the platform). However, we have yet to see big corporate buyers of Bitcoin, like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), Square (NYSE:SQ), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) diversify into this particular crypto.\n\nThe \u201csmart money\u201d may be accelerating their pivot towards cryptocurrencies. But, it may take some time for them to embrace Ethereum as a store of value. This could mean opportunity for those buying today, ahead of this leading \u201caltcoin\u201d finally becoming a major holding of institutional crypto investors. Yet, that alone doesn\u2019t mean now\u2019s the time to buy. With the risk crypto prices continue to fall, there may be a more opportune entry point down the road.\n\nLike I said a few weeks back, it seems most are buying Ethereum, not for its utility, but for its potential to become as valuable as Bitcoin. This event, coined by some as \u201cthe flippening,\u201d may eventually happen. But, buying ETH now, for this reason, may not be the best move. Why? It\u2019s still early to tell whether the recent pullback is the market taking the breather, or the start of the crypto bubble bursting.\n\nBoth popular cryptos have started to bounce back. Yet, there\u2019s plenty in motion to support further moves lower. A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted several of these factors. These include the increased odds of the economy getting over the pandemic this year, rising interest rates, and recent negative remarks about Bitcoin by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nYellen is not the only prominent economic figure who has made negative remarks about cryptocurrencies in recent days. Nouriel Roubini, aka \u201cDr Doom\u201d (for his overall bearish views) recently made the case why Bitcoin is a \u201cpseudo-asset,\u201d adding that it\u2019s highly correlated with stocks, and not a hedge against inflation.\n\nWhile these remarks were specifically about Bitcoin, much of it applies to Ethereum as well. If interest in cryptocurrencies fades due to these aforementioned factors, it\u2019s more than likely that Ethereum will continue to fall back towards prior price levels.\n\nWith this in mind, it may make more sense to take your time before entering a long-term position.\n\nEthereum is interesting in the long-term, but not so much in the short-term.\n\nPreviously, I was more bearish on Ethereum. As I learn more about its advantages over Bitcoin, I agree that it could continue to appreciate in value over the next few years. But, that doesn\u2019t mean I see now as the best time to enter a position.\n\nWith the risk the overheated crypto market pulls back further, take your time before entering a position in Ethereum.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum May Become a Corporate Treasury Asset", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000, Setting A New All-Time High | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Crypto BriefingCryptocurrency", "body": "Ethereum's ascent continues.

ETH often outperforms BTC, however. It\u2019s up roughly 175% year-to-date, while BTC is up 89%.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has also had various wins of its own recently. On Feb. 8, ETH futures launched on CME Group, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange.\n\nThe NFT space, which runs on top of Ethereum, has also enjoyed a boom this year. Several notable celebrities and musicians have piled into the craze, among them Mark Cuban, Logan Paul, and Soulja Boy. This week, iconic auction house Christie\u2019s announced its plans to list an NFT by Beeple. They\u2019ll accept ETH in the auction.\n\nDeFi, meanwhile, continues to grow. There\u2019s over $43 billion locked in DeFi protocols today, according to DeFi Pulse. Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021. Described as an ETH buyback mechanism by EIP-1559 Tim Beiko, the update will see gas fees get burned to reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is now $232.8 billion.\n\nOriginal Post\n"}, {"headline": "Tread Carefully, but Stellar Lumens May Have More Room to Run", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jDGEk7m07GGEvjcDeE4_KQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/c29b5e8f640f2124ee5501dc12ec92d4", "auther": "Thomas Niel ", "body": "With cryptocurrencies once again popular among investors, it\u2019s no surprise the price of Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) continues to climb. Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Latest Ethereum price and analysis (ETH to USD)", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Coin Rivet via Yahoo Finance", "date": "14 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/6enipzxTWF0OnhgQlrlEug--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coin_rivet_596/04fea6b3926e5c528055f1c4d64a2f66", "auther": "Oliver Knight", "body": "Ethereum is currently trading at $1,629 following a rollercoaster week of price action that has seen it fluctuate within a $400 range.\n\nThe week began with a dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015.
