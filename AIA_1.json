dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn\u2019t get buy-in to his proposal.\n\nIf you want to find out more information about Ethereum or cryptocurrencies in general, then use the search box at the top of this page.

While NFTs have been around for years, they\u2019ve drawn increased attention in recent weeks after a number of incredibly lucrative sales.\n\nSource: Vladimir Kazakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNFTs are essentially smart contracts utilizing the blockchain to make sure specific conditions are met before processing a transaction. In practice, the primary use of that feature at this time is to validate transactions and record ownership of the NFT.\n\nThe \u201cnon-fungible\u201d part of the name refers to the fact that each NFT is totally unique. For example, two people may have purchased different NFTs for the same price, but those NFTs aren\u2019t necessarily interchangeable. One might be a GIF by a renowned illustrator, while the other may be an exclusive song by a musician. And their owners may not see their exchange as one to one the same way they would an exchange of say, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC) for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHistorically, NFTs have primarily been used for digital collectibles. You can think of them as online baseball cards, or similar to purchasing a piece of art.\n\nThose digital collectibles are a big part of why NFTs have been a hot news topic of late; last week, graphic designer David Rudnick sold an NFT for 10.8 ETH (approximately $18,600) on Zora, an NFT marketplace.\n\nThis particular NFT provides a valuable case study: Rudnick himself shared a copy of the digital art piece for free online. This is one area where NFTs truly begin to differ from visual art, which derive value from not only their aesthetic value or perceived growth potential, but also their actual scarcity.\n\nNFTs however, can become more valuable by virtue of being shared widely. Some liken this to buying a print of a painting, as opposed to owning it outright. Yes, I can put up a poster of the Mona Lisa in my home, but its not the real deal, even if it looks exactly the same. And by owning a poster of the Mona Lisa, I\u2019m adding to the perceived cultural value of the original work.\n\nDue to the blockchain nature of NFTs, creators can profit not only off the first point-of-sale, but also take a commission fee of subsequent resales, providing a distinct advantage for artists over traditional models. And it\u2019s not just visual artists engaged in the space.\n\nThe NBA has also gotten into the digital collectible game with its NBA Top Shot app. The app allows users to purchase certificates of ownership for game highlight videos, such as a particularly strong block by Zion Williamson.\n\nMeanwhile, in the music world, producers are releasing sample packs and exclusive music via NFTs.\n\nOne potentially lucrative future application of NFTs might be concert tickets. Given that NFTs are smart contracts, the blockchain could validate rules for tickets to set a ceiling on resale prices and how often a ticket can change ownership before the show.\n\nThere are also NFT applications in gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) to consider.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to say where NFTs go next, surging interest suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of the technology being more broadly adopted, similar to how increasing use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies led to their widespread acceptance today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices.

Earlier in February, the digital currency\u2019s market value exceeded $1 trillion, according to Coindesk. Even now, several investors remain skeptical about putting their capital into the asset. However, the writing is on the wall.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInstitutional interest in Bitcoin is at an all-time high. Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), the nation\u2019s oldest bank, is paving the way for Bitcoin to use the networks usually reserved for conventional financial assets. Not so long ago, major custodian banks stayed away from the space due to regulatory or legal risks. However, client demand is forcing them to reevaluate their positions.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin according to a regulatory filing. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that Tesla has made approximately $1 billion in paper profits from the investment thus far.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnline payment processing companies PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ) have already allowed their users to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin. PayPal, in particular, is a real coup for Bitcoin. As of the end of 2020, it had total active accounts of 377 million.\n\nThe overarching theme is that the rally in Bitcoin prices is forcing the world\u2019s largest publicly traded financial services companies and major Wall Street giants to rethink their approach. That\u2019s why one shouldn\u2019t be skeptical of investing in the space at the moment. Bitcoin is finally going mainstream, and although there will be blips on the way, the trajectory is upward.\n\nChances are that if you read the news, the Bitcoin rally is something you are aware of. The cryptocurrency had a smashing 2020, rocketing to $20,000 from around $1,000. Due to the epic bull run, many investors compared the situation to the last time the digital currency went parabolic back in 2017.\n-  8 Risky Stocks to Buy If Danger Is Your Middle Name \n\nHowever, there are several key differences in the current run with the one we had back in 2017. Firstly, it may seem surprising, but the 2020-2021 run is less extreme than the last one. In that case, we saw a 20x return while the last year was roughly an 8x return.\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that in 2017 several projects kicked off as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), leading to massive runups for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), Ripple (CCC:XRP-USD), and their ilk. In fact, the other cryptos surpassed the Bitcoin rally and then some.\n\nCut to the current run, and it\u2019s the complete opposite. Bitcoin is leading the charge, with several cryptos rising in its shadow, rather than the other way around. CryptoCompare data shows the trading volumes for the digital currency on the eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk 20 have exceeded $11 billion, beating the 2017 all-time record.\n\nLastly, Bitcoin is going mainstream. Everyone wants to take advantage of the massive rally, and that\u2019s why you see massive financial institutions jump on the bandwagon as well. I\u2019ve gone through several major companies that have embraced digital currency, but I want to single out Mastercard\u2019s (NYSE:MA) recent announcement before moving to the next section. It has said that it will support \u201cselect cryptocurrencies\u201d on its network in the latter half of the year.\n\nAnother instance of corporate America warming up to Bitcoin.\n\nDespite the amazing bull run, there are still several skeptics out there. I would classify them into two categories. One set doesn\u2019t believe in the inherent story of Bitcoin, equating it to the tulip mania of 1637. The other group feels valuation is stretched at this point, and bubble bursting will make their investment worthless. We\u2019ve already addressed the concerns of the latter through this article. But the first set merits further discussion.\n\nEssentially, these are coming from the Warren Buffet school of investing. The Oracle of Omaha has steered clear of investing in Bitcoin and has laid out his reasons. Firstly, the billionaire investor only pours capital into areas that he understands.\n\nAdditionally, he has a firm \u201cbuy and hold\u201d strategy based on years of investing experience. He has held onto companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) because he believes in their story. These companies produce stable recurring cash flow based on their excellent business models. However, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have that. So, Buffet prefers to stay away.\n\nIf you are reading this and that strategy sounds a lot like how you invest, then it\u2019s tough work to convince you. However, if you have held this digital asset for a while, the ebbs and flows are not new.\n\nWhat keeps you interested in Bitcoin is the prospect of making 10 times on your investment. And there are no signs at the moment that stormy days are ahead for the cryptocurrency, which is finally getting a seat at the table in the investing world.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. \n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

And hide from these days we remained all alone. Staying in the same place, just staying out the time. Touching from a distance, Further all the time.\" Joy Division, Transmission\n\nOver the last few weeks I've been digging deep into my own assumptions about how the world works. I've seen enough cool stuff fly by to (occasionally) recognize when I should keep my mouth shut until I actually wade into a topic. That's largely how I've felt about Crypto. When Bitcoin took off about a decade ago, I did the obligatory amount of reading most nerds did, chuckled at all my Young Turk analysts buying Bitcoin for $49 or whatever it was at the time. I adopted the fashionable \"Tsk, Bitcoin, but Hrm, blockchain?\" stance that still pervades most of finance on the 'Security-Notional' side of the balance sheet -- the world of stocks and bonds and futures and options and all that jazz. I wasn't paying enough attention.\n\nI'm not writing this for all of you deep crypto nerds -- y'all are the ones I'm learning from. I fully expect y'all to:\n- Light me up over everything I've got wrong.\n- Point out the people and groups that already figured this out, but whom I couldn't find on Google this weekend.\n\nBut for the rest of you:\n\nLet's start by thinking about what the whole point of a mutual fund or ETF or SMA or CIT is to you as the investor. You move money from the Cash economy (where we actually accumulate and spend dollars) to the Security-Notional economy (where we own assets we mark to a \"price\") through a brokerage account. That's quite literally the point of your broker. They sit between the Cash Economy and the Security-Notional economy and help you transact in the later. You allocate money from your cash into, say, an ETF. That ETF is nothing more than a slice of intellectual property (IP), whether they come from MSCI as part of an index, or from Cathie Wood's team at ARK Invest. That IP is then implemented through trades in underlying securities, through in kind creations or by taking cash from an Authorized Participant, and dozens of other fun but shockingly complex bits of work happen under the hood to keep the portfolio trued up (corporate actions, splits, M&A, securities lending, etc.) You can imagine it a bit like this:\n\nSo what are you really paying for? Well, sometimes the IP involved is expensive, and unique (like, say, the active management of ARKK). Sometimes it's relatively simple and loaded with competition (like, say, MSCI's large cap U.S. Index). You as an investor should expect to pay accordingly. You're also paying for all the other stuff, but that tends to be relatively inexpensive. If your ETF is in U.S. stocks, you'd expect it to be cheap, but if its emerging market local currency debt with hedging overlays? Well, you'd expect to pay a bit more.\n\nLet's tease this out and try to imagine the most efficient way this could work. The actual IP here is trivial to package up. It's just a continuous broadcast of portfolio state, a carnival barker yelling \"STEP RIGHT UP AND SEE TODAY'S S&P 500.\" In the world of modern data, there's little difference between publishing that daily in the Wall St. Journal and building an API that a computer could poke at on demand to get constituents. Even the most active manager does essentially the same thing: they just say what the contents of the IP are, all the time.\n\nIn order to get paid for that IP, we've created all sorts of systems. Most involve you literally giving the money to the IP holder, and letting them handle the rest. If you want access to ARK, you can buy a mutual fund or an ETF, or if you're big enough, open up an SMA. But regardless, you move money across the notional barrier from your pile of cash into some Security-Notional vehicle, which ARK then manages. But what you're really looking for is the IP. Index providers get paid a little differently - they license their intellectual property to pretty much anyone, but the real money is in licensing it to fund managers who package it up into ETFs and funds of their own. They also license their IP to media, researchers, data providers, and so on.\n\nThe implementation part turns out to be relatively annoying. So much so that we've created all sorts of products to avoid it: index futures in particular were created to avoid the friction of implementation (among other things). So were 'synthetic ETFs' in Europe or Exchange-Traded Notes here in the U.S., and of course a huge chunk of the derivatives markets from swaps to structured notes. The IP is what matters. The implementation is just friction.\n\nThe New Hotness, in case you missed it, is 'Non-Fungible Tokens' or NFTs. The idea of an NFT is pretty simple: it's simply a digital blob that can't be duplicated, and it is one of a kind. This is distinct from Bitcoin, which are digital blobs of which there are currently 18 million. Yours is exactly as useful as mine. With an NFT, you make a one and done for each token. You can 'burn' it, but you can't change it, and it's unique. This the idea behind the widely popularized NBA TopShot digital collectible ... THINGS.\n\nA Sidebar for Nerds: I am hung up on digital objects having utility, and I'm trying to get past it. I have opened countless 'digital packs' of 'digital cards' that I paid real money for to play a game called Magic: The Gathering. Those fake things had real utility to me, because I enjoy playing a game that I can only play if I have those cards. I have absolutely no emotional attachment to my ownership of them. At the very same time, I don't, at my core, understand or appreciate the value of a piece of digital artwork which I could see in my browser right now for free, just because you tell me mine's 'official'. Give me copyright and let me put it on my business cards or sell it to Getty Images? Sure. But just to know I own one of 100 \"real\" copies that is now mine? Nope. I am 100% aware of the ridiculous double standard here, and I am not suggesting I'm correct. I'm saying it's where I'm at right now.\n\nEach card in a TopShot pack, or each piece of digital artwork on Rarible, OpenSea, or a dozen other platforms, is usually just a Smart Contract tied to the Ethereum network. (I wrote a bit about smart contracts last week, but in short, they take a bunch of business logic, embed it in a piece of publicly accessible code in the Ethereum blockchain, and run as cloud-computing applications using ETH as the way you pay for computing cycles. They're cool.)\n\nNFT's 'wrap' other objects inside their smart contracts. So for example, if you buy a piece of digital art, the literal image could be wrapped in the token (the ones and zeros that make the GIF), or more likely, the token wraps a digital key that in turn unlocks a much higher resolution version. Since the token itself can be moved around and interacted with, there's a cost to both how complex and how big the tokens can be in practice.\n\nWhat you put into an NFT is entirely about trust. The NBA is wrapping up MP4s (or keys to them) in the body of their NFT. Other artists are putting keys to unlock music. I went to Rarible last night and minted 5 Non-Fungible Tokens of my own. I used their point-and-click tools and did no programming whatsoever.\n\nSince I have no real talent, I decided the thing I would sell was an item of external trust. If you buy one of these tokens, all you own is my promise. And my promise is minted on the token: you can transfer the token back to me (which I will then destroy or resell), in return for me giving you one hour of my life.\n\n(I am not expecting anyone to buy these. I'm making a bit of a point here: you can wrap anything in a smart contract, as long as you have a trust bridge. In this case the trust bridge is my word. If you think I'm unreliable, my promise is worthless. If you think I'm a person of my word, then the token is actually worth one of the projected 700,000 hours of my life. But feel free to buy it if you like!)\n\nThe process was relatively simple, but it wasn't free. In order to mint these 5 tokens, I had to pay 'Gas' to mint my contracts and make them available for people to buy. Gas is the computational currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Minting my tokens meant I sent a set of code out to the blockchain. When some miner minted a new ETH block, my work was done (and I paid him, in Gas). My cost for this was about $40 at current ETH prices and the load of the network last night. To participate in this weirdness, I had to join the Crypto Notional economy. I had to purchase a little bit of ETH (which I did at Coinbase). Because I need a 'hard' wallet -- a specific address on the blockchain that my new NFT's belong to and are minted by -- I had to move my ETH from Coinbase over to Metamask (one of many web-based hard wallets). I could also have used a wallet on my phone, or even resorted to writing a long string on paper somewhere.\n\nOnce I spent some cash at Coinbase to get into the crypto side of the house, everything that happens with this token happens only in the Crypto Notional economy. If you want to buy one of my tokens (guaranteed only one of 700,000 it would be possible to make!), you're going to owe me an ETH (the minimum Rarible lets you mint a token for, I'm not that much of a egotist). How much this is worth to you, as a buyer, will depend on at least two things: how much you value Ethereum, and how much you value an hour of my time. It would be easy to say \"well, the first is just an exchange rate,\" but since we both now need ETH to interact, (and it's easy to imagine all the internety-things ETH could be used for), ETH has utility beyond its simple conversion back and forth to USD. It is itself a useful good required to buy computing cycles from the cloud to implement smart contracts.\n\nOne really cool and still somewhat nascent feature of smart contracts is the idea of an Oracle. An Oracle is an external provider of data to a smart contract. So for example, if you have a contract that pays out on who wins a presidential election, you could assign a specific Oracle to have the contract consult to determine who won (Associated Press, etc). The beauty of such a system is that you can have information enter the smart contract without any human involvement and without creating a giant bloated mass of a smart contract which would cost far too much gas to run.\n\nPut another way, an Oracle to a Smart Contract is simply a way of accessing a piece of intellectual property that lives OFF OF the blockchain - the state of an external data set. So what if a PM or an Index provider, instead of running money, simply provided an oracle: an API that any (approved, secured) system could talk to which told the requestor in real time what a given portfolio looks like: 4% AAPL, 2% TSLA, etc. (This is essentially what CRSP does right now in their partnership with Symbiont and Vanguard, but to my understanding, that's effectively a closed network, in the same way FedWire is. They just use blockchain for fault tolerance and efficiency.)\n\nSo this part is pretty well trod: baking portfolio IP into a blockchain. What's the next step? Getting paid.\n\nWhen you buy an NFT, you're not just buying whatever IP got wrapped up in the contract, you're also getting access to a whole set of business logic coded into the NFT. In the dominant standard for digital art, ETC-721, a standard for paying royalties exists (and is part of my NadigHour tokens). If you decide to sell my token to Elon Musk for $1 million in a decade because I discovered the secret to time travel and it's a collectible (I won't, and it won't be), 10% of that transaction will get funneled back to the same ETH address I used to mint the coins. That's really cool for, say, an artist who's actually selling copyrights.\n\nBut back to indexing: coding up a smart contract to access an oracle that happens to return the constituents of an index or portfolio is pretty much trivial, but so what? If we stopped right here, what we have is a really interesting way of getting IP into direct indexing accounts. After all, this could just power all my fractional share trades at OSAM's Canvas or whatever Schwab launches this year. That's just a fun new way of sending a spreadsheet, often, with a lot of security and transaction history.\n\nBut what if a new kind of ETF (call it the CryptoETF) could access this information as a Portfolio Token? For example, Matt's Index issues a Portfolio Token to the Dave's Large-Cap CryptoETF (cDAVE). It's a singular NFT -- it exists to create the connection between Matt's Index and the CryptoETF, and its precise terms could be negotiated. Whenever the CryptoETF wants to adjust its portfolio (could be once a day, could be every second), they access the functions of the smart contract that is part of the Portfolio Token. As part of that access, the CryptoETF presents evidence of AUM, and remits payment (based on daily AUM over time, just like now, perhaps) to Matt's Index (in a tokenized store of value, like a stable coin) in return for that instance of access. Baking in the appropriate business logic here is absolutely trivial. The programming language used for smart contracts, Solidity, is ludicrously straightforward for anyone who has ever learned JavaScript (which at this point should cover every programmer born since 1970).\n\nWhat's even cooler is if to imagine a world where the Fund Company side of this transaction exists entirely in the Crypto Notional economy. What if the fund itself was simply a set of cryptographic assets. Instead of own individual stocks, say, they could own tokenized stocks. This is effectively what happens over at FTX (U.S. investors need not apply). FTX runs an exchange where you can trade token pairs (I give you an apple, you give me an orange). In order to make the apples say, bitcoin, and the oranges, say, Tesla Stock, they partnered with a brokerage to essentially create a giant public dark pool. Everyone opens up dual accounts with both FTX and their Security-Notional brokerage partner, CM-Equity, and FTX allows members of the dark pool to trade these token pairs with each other, which are then mimicked in the dark pool being run by CM-Equity (essentially). Each each token, in a way, represents a share in the dark pool run by the Securities Notional partner, assigned to a certain exposure (say, a share of TSLA). It's far to complex and fraught with single-counterparty risks (my opinion, feel free to yell at me), but I get why they ended up this way. Regulators are terrified, so you have to play ball with securities laws.\n\nA far more efficient way to bridge this gap between the Security-Notional ownership of $TSLA stock and the tokenized Crypto-Notional version of TSLA would be to simply establish bridged liquidity pools. This is the topic for an entire different discussion, but essentially, the Uniswap model for managing liquidity in any pair of assets is quite elegant, and there's really no reason (other than regulation) you couldn't apply it to any single asset class.\n\nVery briefly, each notional tradable pair (say, a stable coin like USDT vs. TSLA stock) would exist as its own pool of both (some USDT and some TSLA) to create an 'Exposure Token', which is what gets traded. When it gets out of balance, prices change to create arbitrage opportunities. This is how Uniswap handles a swap between, say, Ethereum and Bitcoin:\n\n(I get that I'm shorthanding an *enormous* amount here and I apologize, but I encourage ops nerds like me to dig in. It's super cool, and embeds all sorts of economics, like paying liqudiity providers for showing up beyond just providing an arbitrage opportunity).\n\nRight now, such a bridge token would likely violate a whole pile of securities laws in the U.S. -- which is exactly what we need to fix. But lets hand-wave that. If the fund company could, instead of going and buying a bunch of stocks on the Security-Notional side of things, instead simply go and buy a bunch of Exposure Tokens on the Crypto-Notional side of things, the implications are profound:\n- A 'CryptoETF' simply becomes a collection of tokens.\n- The CryptoETF itself, now just a collection of tokens tied to an external Portfolio Token which contains the IP, can implement business logic, and itself be tokenized.\n- The CryptoETF token presents methods for automatically accessing creation and redemption -- n ew CryptoETF tokens are created or burned based using baskets of the appropriate Exposure Tokens (tokenized TSLA, tokenized gold, whatever), which could of course change at any time based on new information from the Portfolio Token.\n- Any changes to the portfolio of any kind can be 100% automated -- because all you're doing is swapping Exposure Tokens for Exposure Tokens. If the fund needs to sell some Apple and buy some Tesla, the business logic of the CryptoETF can just automatically make the paired transactions back to a decentralized exchange like Uniswap.\n- Since the CryptoETF is itself tokenized, it can be transferred through Decentralized Exchanges, presented as collateral, or just stored somewhere, all without any direct involvement of the current global securities infrastructure (that's up to the liquidity providers).\n\nMy 'aha' moment here is that all of the above is so trivial, technically. The entirety of this could be coded into Ethereum-based tokens in a weekend (by someone else, I'm tired) using existing tech. It's also 100% impossible in the current regulatory environment. These Exposure Tokens could naturally be regulated entities with any counterparty risks or structural issues backstopped by our good friends at the DTCC. While that might make crypto-evangelists break out into hives, any bridging to the Security-Notional economy is going to require a counterparty to at the very least act as custodian for the Security-Notional side of the tokens, until we actually get rid of stocks and bonds altogether and just issue ownership rights directly to a blockchain.\n\nAll this is what i meant when I said last week that the United States has a real opportunity to lead here. Really thoughtful regulatory environments could turn the United States into the de facto global capitalist engine for the next 50 years. The path we're on is one of almost complete neglect. A little poking around the edges of central bank digital currencies doesn't cut it.\n\nSo what's the to-do list? Build standards. Build a regulatory framework supporting those standards. Implement. That's how this always works. The crypto community should be working hand in hand with regulators to make this future, not in conflict with, but in collaboration with the traditional Security-Notional economy. And doing so would put the U.S. back conducting the train of global capitalism, instead of hanging out in the caboose.\n\n--\n\nA Postscript on Bitcoin: I'm a well documented Bitcoin skeptic, as I am of all psychological commodities. I am however becoming slightly less of one because of a single realization: Bitcoin, more than anything, is collateral. It's a crypto-native asset that is widely held, traded, and valued. That's why folks like FTX and Binance treat Bitcoin as nearly-cash when it comes to posting collateral into a trading account on which to earn interest or gain margin, although even there, everything is marked at a USD amount. You can build an ecosystem to get away from fiat currencies, but it's gonna be a whole 'nother matter to get away from a peg. \n\nFinal Note: Ideas are ephemeral and implementation is everything. If you're already doing all this, please let me know. I'm sorry I missed you in my google search. If you think this is a cool idea and you go build some giant thing around it, feel free to put me on your board or buy one of my tokens (grin).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n-

dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn\u2019t get buy-in to his proposal.\n\nIf you want to find out more information about Ethereum or cryptocurrencies in general, then use the search box at the top of this page.

While NFTs have been around for years, they\u2019ve drawn increased attention in recent weeks after a number of incredibly lucrative sales.\n\nSource: Vladimir Kazakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNFTs are essentially smart contracts utilizing the blockchain to make sure specific conditions are met before processing a transaction. In practice, the primary use of that feature at this time is to validate transactions and record ownership of the NFT.\n\nThe \u201cnon-fungible\u201d part of the name refers to the fact that each NFT is totally unique. For example, two people may have purchased different NFTs for the same price, but those NFTs aren\u2019t necessarily interchangeable. One might be a GIF by a renowned illustrator, while the other may be an exclusive song by a musician. And their owners may not see their exchange as one to one the same way they would an exchange of say, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC) for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHistorically, NFTs have primarily been used for digital collectibles. You can think of them as online baseball cards, or similar to purchasing a piece of art.\n\nThose digital collectibles are a big part of why NFTs have been a hot news topic of late; last week, graphic designer David Rudnick sold an NFT for 10.8 ETH (approximately $18,600) on Zora, an NFT marketplace.\n\nThis particular NFT provides a valuable case study: Rudnick himself shared a copy of the digital art piece for free online. This is one area where NFTs truly begin to differ from visual art, which derive value from not only their aesthetic value or perceived growth potential, but also their actual scarcity.\n\nNFTs however, can become more valuable by virtue of being shared widely. Some liken this to buying a print of a painting, as opposed to owning it outright. Yes, I can put up a poster of the Mona Lisa in my home, but its not the real deal, even if it looks exactly the same. And by owning a poster of the Mona Lisa, I\u2019m adding to the perceived cultural value of the original work.\n\nDue to the blockchain nature of NFTs, creators can profit not only off the first point-of-sale, but also take a commission fee of subsequent resales, providing a distinct advantage for artists over traditional models. And it\u2019s not just visual artists engaged in the space.\n\nThe NBA has also gotten into the digital collectible game with its NBA Top Shot app. The app allows users to purchase certificates of ownership for game highlight videos, such as a particularly strong block by Zion Williamson.\n\nMeanwhile, in the music world, producers are releasing sample packs and exclusive music via NFTs.\n\nOne potentially lucrative future application of NFTs might be concert tickets. Given that NFTs are smart contracts, the blockchain could validate rules for tickets to set a ceiling on resale prices and how often a ticket can change ownership before the show.\n\nThere are also NFT applications in gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) to consider.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to say where NFTs go next, surging interest suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of the technology being more broadly adopted, similar to how increasing use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies led to their widespread acceptance today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices.

Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: Arcane Research: Banking on Bitcoin \u2013 The State of Bitcoin As Collateral\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nazarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei. Gas fees are currently at historic highs with an average transaction surpassing $40 Tuesday, according to Blockchair.\n\nRelated: US Central Bank Explains 'Preconditions' for a Digital Dollar\n\nNot only will the update lessen congestion on Ethereum, but it should decrease call latency, Nazarov said.\n\n\u201cReally what OCR does is take the computation we were doing on-chain and porting it out to an off-chain environment, and that is creating a very large 10x increase in efficiency, which means we can put a lot more data on-chain,\u201d Nazarov said.\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin leads cryptocurrency market sell-off", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/vw1fdt06miUfG.jz01liHA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/1be9f990-75ae-11eb-b69e-3032bd328801", "auther": "Oscar Williams-Grut", "body": "A sharp and broad-based sell-off has hit the cryptocurrency market, piercing a recent bull run powered by corporate and retail interest alike.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

Earlier in February, the digital currency\u2019s market value exceeded $1 trillion, according to Coindesk. Even now, several investors remain skeptical about putting their capital into the asset. However, the writing is on the wall.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInstitutional interest in Bitcoin is at an all-time high. Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), the nation\u2019s oldest bank, is paving the way for Bitcoin to use the networks usually reserved for conventional financial assets. Not so long ago, major custodian banks stayed away from the space due to regulatory or legal risks. However, client demand is forcing them to reevaluate their positions.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin according to a regulatory filing. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that Tesla has made approximately $1 billion in paper profits from the investment thus far.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnline payment processing companies PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ) have already allowed their users to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin. PayPal, in particular, is a real coup for Bitcoin. As of the end of 2020, it had total active accounts of 377 million.\n\nThe overarching theme is that the rally in Bitcoin prices is forcing the world\u2019s largest publicly traded financial services companies and major Wall Street giants to rethink their approach. That\u2019s why one shouldn\u2019t be skeptical of investing in the space at the moment. Bitcoin is finally going mainstream, and although there will be blips on the way, the trajectory is upward.\n\nChances are that if you read the news, the Bitcoin rally is something you are aware of. The cryptocurrency had a smashing 2020, rocketing to $20,000 from around $1,000. Due to the epic bull run, many investors compared the situation to the last time the digital currency went parabolic back in 2017.\n-  8 Risky Stocks to Buy If Danger Is Your Middle Name \n\nHowever, there are several key differences in the current run with the one we had back in 2017. Firstly, it may seem surprising, but the 2020-2021 run is less extreme than the last one. In that case, we saw a 20x return while the last year was roughly an 8x return.\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that in 2017 several projects kicked off as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), leading to massive runups for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), Ripple (CCC:XRP-USD), and their ilk. In fact, the other cryptos surpassed the Bitcoin rally and then some.\n\nCut to the current run, and it\u2019s the complete opposite. Bitcoin is leading the charge, with several cryptos rising in its shadow, rather than the other way around. CryptoCompare data shows the trading volumes for the digital currency on the eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk 20 have exceeded $11 billion, beating the 2017 all-time record.\n\nLastly, Bitcoin is going mainstream. Everyone wants to take advantage of the massive rally, and that\u2019s why you see massive financial institutions jump on the bandwagon as well. I\u2019ve gone through several major companies that have embraced digital currency, but I want to single out Mastercard\u2019s (NYSE:MA) recent announcement before moving to the next section. It has said that it will support \u201cselect cryptocurrencies\u201d on its network in the latter half of the year.\n\nAnother instance of corporate America warming up to Bitcoin.\n\nDespite the amazing bull run, there are still several skeptics out there. I would classify them into two categories. One set doesn\u2019t believe in the inherent story of Bitcoin, equating it to the tulip mania of 1637. The other group feels valuation is stretched at this point, and bubble bursting will make their investment worthless. We\u2019ve already addressed the concerns of the latter through this article. But the first set merits further discussion.\n\nEssentially, these are coming from the Warren Buffet school of investing. The Oracle of Omaha has steered clear of investing in Bitcoin and has laid out his reasons. Firstly, the billionaire investor only pours capital into areas that he understands.\n\nAdditionally, he has a firm \u201cbuy and hold\u201d strategy based on years of investing experience. He has held onto companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) because he believes in their story. These companies produce stable recurring cash flow based on their excellent business models. However, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have that. So, Buffet prefers to stay away.\n\nIf you are reading this and that strategy sounds a lot like how you invest, then it\u2019s tough work to convince you. However, if you have held this digital asset for a while, the ebbs and flows are not new.\n\nWhat keeps you interested in Bitcoin is the prospect of making 10 times on your investment. And there are no signs at the moment that stormy days are ahead for the cryptocurrency, which is finally getting a seat at the table in the investing world.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. \n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

And hide from these days we remained all alone. Staying in the same place, just staying out the time. Touching from a distance, Further all the time.\" Joy Division, Transmission\n\nOver the last few weeks I've been digging deep into my own assumptions about how the world works. I've seen enough cool stuff fly by to (occasionally) recognize when I should keep my mouth shut until I actually wade into a topic. That's largely how I've felt about Crypto. When Bitcoin took off about a decade ago, I did the obligatory amount of reading most nerds did, chuckled at all my Young Turk analysts buying Bitcoin for $49 or whatever it was at the time. I adopted the fashionable \"Tsk, Bitcoin, but Hrm, blockchain?\" stance that still pervades most of finance on the 'Security-Notional' side of the balance sheet -- the world of stocks and bonds and futures and options and all that jazz. I wasn't paying enough attention.\n\nI'm not writing this for all of you deep crypto nerds -- y'all are the ones I'm learning from. I fully expect y'all to:\n- Light me up over everything I've got wrong.\n- Point out the people and groups that already figured this out, but whom I couldn't find on Google this weekend.\n\nBut for the rest of you:\n\nLet's start by thinking about what the whole point of a mutual fund or ETF or SMA or CIT is to you as the investor. You move money from the Cash economy (where we actually accumulate and spend dollars) to the Security-Notional economy (where we own assets we mark to a \"price\") through a brokerage account. That's quite literally the point of your broker. They sit between the Cash Economy and the Security-Notional economy and help you transact in the later. You allocate money from your cash into, say, an ETF. That ETF is nothing more than a slice of intellectual property (IP), whether they come from MSCI as part of an index, or from Cathie Wood's team at ARK Invest. That IP is then implemented through trades in underlying securities, through in kind creations or by taking cash from an Authorized Participant, and dozens of other fun but shockingly complex bits of work happen under the hood to keep the portfolio trued up (corporate actions, splits, M&A, securities lending, etc.) You can imagine it a bit like this:\n\nSo what are you really paying for? Well, sometimes the IP involved is expensive, and unique (like, say, the active management of ARKK). Sometimes it's relatively simple and loaded with competition (like, say, MSCI's large cap U.S. Index). You as an investor should expect to pay accordingly. You're also paying for all the other stuff, but that tends to be relatively inexpensive. If your ETF is in U.S. stocks, you'd expect it to be cheap, but if its emerging market local currency debt with hedging overlays? Well, you'd expect to pay a bit more.\n\nLet's tease this out and try to imagine the most efficient way this could work. The actual IP here is trivial to package up. It's just a continuous broadcast of portfolio state, a carnival barker yelling \"STEP RIGHT UP AND SEE TODAY'S S&P 500.\" In the world of modern data, there's little difference between publishing that daily in the Wall St. Journal and building an API that a computer could poke at on demand to get constituents. Even the most active manager does essentially the same thing: they just say what the contents of the IP are, all the time.\n\nIn order to get paid for that IP, we've created all sorts of systems. Most involve you literally giving the money to the IP holder, and letting them handle the rest. If you want access to ARK, you can buy a mutual fund or an ETF, or if you're big enough, open up an SMA. But regardless, you move money across the notional barrier from your pile of cash into some Security-Notional vehicle, which ARK then manages. But what you're really looking for is the IP. Index providers get paid a little differently - they license their intellectual property to pretty much anyone, but the real money is in licensing it to fund managers who package it up into ETFs and funds of their own. They also license their IP to media, researchers, data providers, and so on.\n\nThe implementation part turns out to be relatively annoying. So much so that we've created all sorts of products to avoid it: index futures in particular were created to avoid the friction of implementation (among other things). So were 'synthetic ETFs' in Europe or Exchange-Traded Notes here in the U.S., and of course a huge chunk of the derivatives markets from swaps to structured notes. The IP is what matters. The implementation is just friction.\n\nThe New Hotness, in case you missed it, is 'Non-Fungible Tokens' or NFTs. The idea of an NFT is pretty simple: it's simply a digital blob that can't be duplicated, and it is one of a kind. This is distinct from Bitcoin, which are digital blobs of which there are currently 18 million. Yours is exactly as useful as mine. With an NFT, you make a one and done for each token. You can 'burn' it, but you can't change it, and it's unique. This the idea behind the widely popularized NBA TopShot digital collectible ... THINGS.\n\nA Sidebar for Nerds: I am hung up on digital objects having utility, and I'm trying to get past it. I have opened countless 'digital packs' of 'digital cards' that I paid real money for to play a game called Magic: The Gathering. Those fake things had real utility to me, because I enjoy playing a game that I can only play if I have those cards. I have absolutely no emotional attachment to my ownership of them. At the very same time, I don't, at my core, understand or appreciate the value of a piece of digital artwork which I could see in my browser right now for free, just because you tell me mine's 'official'. Give me copyright and let me put it on my business cards or sell it to Getty Images? Sure. But just to know I own one of 100 \"real\" copies that is now mine? Nope. I am 100% aware of the ridiculous double standard here, and I am not suggesting I'm correct. I'm saying it's where I'm at right now.\n\nEach card in a TopShot pack, or each piece of digital artwork on Rarible, OpenSea, or a dozen other platforms, is usually just a Smart Contract tied to the Ethereum network. (I wrote a bit about smart contracts last week, but in short, they take a bunch of business logic, embed it in a piece of publicly accessible code in the Ethereum blockchain, and run as cloud-computing applications using ETH as the way you pay for computing cycles. They're cool.)\n\nNFT's 'wrap' other objects inside their smart contracts. So for example, if you buy a piece of digital art, the literal image could be wrapped in the token (the ones and zeros that make the GIF), or more likely, the token wraps a digital key that in turn unlocks a much higher resolution version. Since the token itself can be moved around and interacted with, there's a cost to both how complex and how big the tokens can be in practice.\n\nWhat you put into an NFT is entirely about trust. The NBA is wrapping up MP4s (or keys to them) in the body of their NFT. Other artists are putting keys to unlock music. I went to Rarible last night and minted 5 Non-Fungible Tokens of my own. I used their point-and-click tools and did no programming whatsoever.\n\nSince I have no real talent, I decided the thing I would sell was an item of external trust. If you buy one of these tokens, all you own is my promise. And my promise is minted on the token: you can transfer the token back to me (which I will then destroy or resell), in return for me giving you one hour of my life.\n\n(I am not expecting anyone to buy these. I'm making a bit of a point here: you can wrap anything in a smart contract, as long as you have a trust bridge. In this case the trust bridge is my word. If you think I'm unreliable, my promise is worthless. If you think I'm a person of my word, then the token is actually worth one of the projected 700,000 hours of my life. But feel free to buy it if you like!)\n\nThe process was relatively simple, but it wasn't free. In order to mint these 5 tokens, I had to pay 'Gas' to mint my contracts and make them available for people to buy. Gas is the computational currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Minting my tokens meant I sent a set of code out to the blockchain. When some miner minted a new ETH block, my work was done (and I paid him, in Gas). My cost for this was about $40 at current ETH prices and the load of the network last night. To participate in this weirdness, I had to join the Crypto Notional economy. I had to purchase a little bit of ETH (which I did at Coinbase). Because I need a 'hard' wallet -- a specific address on the blockchain that my new NFT's belong to and are minted by -- I had to move my ETH from Coinbase over to Metamask (one of many web-based hard wallets). I could also have used a wallet on my phone, or even resorted to writing a long string on paper somewhere.\n\nOnce I spent some cash at Coinbase to get into the crypto side of the house, everything that happens with this token happens only in the Crypto Notional economy. If you want to buy one of my tokens (guaranteed only one of 700,000 it would be possible to make!), you're going to owe me an ETH (the minimum Rarible lets you mint a token for, I'm not that much of a egotist). How much this is worth to you, as a buyer, will depend on at least two things: how much you value Ethereum, and how much you value an hour of my time. It would be easy to say \"well, the first is just an exchange rate,\" but since we both now need ETH to interact, (and it's easy to imagine all the internety-things ETH could be used for), ETH has utility beyond its simple conversion back and forth to USD. It is itself a useful good required to buy computing cycles from the cloud to implement smart contracts.\n\nOne really cool and still somewhat nascent feature of smart contracts is the idea of an Oracle. An Oracle is an external provider of data to a smart contract. So for example, if you have a contract that pays out on who wins a presidential election, you could assign a specific Oracle to have the contract consult to determine who won (Associated Press, etc). The beauty of such a system is that you can have information enter the smart contract without any human involvement and without creating a giant bloated mass of a smart contract which would cost far too much gas to run.\n\nPut another way, an Oracle to a Smart Contract is simply a way of accessing a piece of intellectual property that lives OFF OF the blockchain - the state of an external data set. So what if a PM or an Index provider, instead of running money, simply provided an oracle: an API that any (approved, secured) system could talk to which told the requestor in real time what a given portfolio looks like: 4% AAPL, 2% TSLA, etc. (This is essentially what CRSP does right now in their partnership with Symbiont and Vanguard, but to my understanding, that's effectively a closed network, in the same way FedWire is. They just use blockchain for fault tolerance and efficiency.)\n\nSo this part is pretty well trod: baking portfolio IP into a blockchain. What's the next step? Getting paid.\n\nWhen you buy an NFT, you're not just buying whatever IP got wrapped up in the contract, you're also getting access to a whole set of business logic coded into the NFT. In the dominant standard for digital art, ETC-721, a standard for paying royalties exists (and is part of my NadigHour tokens). If you decide to sell my token to Elon Musk for $1 million in a decade because I discovered the secret to time travel and it's a collectible (I won't, and it won't be), 10% of that transaction will get funneled back to the same ETH address I used to mint the coins. That's really cool for, say, an artist who's actually selling copyrights.\n\nBut back to indexing: coding up a smart contract to access an oracle that happens to return the constituents of an index or portfolio is pretty much trivial, but so what? If we stopped right here, what we have is a really interesting way of getting IP into direct indexing accounts. After all, this could just power all my fractional share trades at OSAM's Canvas or whatever Schwab launches this year. That's just a fun new way of sending a spreadsheet, often, with a lot of security and transaction history.\n\nBut what if a new kind of ETF (call it the CryptoETF) could access this information as a Portfolio Token? For example, Matt's Index issues a Portfolio Token to the Dave's Large-Cap CryptoETF (cDAVE). It's a singular NFT -- it exists to create the connection between Matt's Index and the CryptoETF, and its precise terms could be negotiated. Whenever the CryptoETF wants to adjust its portfolio (could be once a day, could be every second), they access the functions of the smart contract that is part of the Portfolio Token. As part of that access, the CryptoETF presents evidence of AUM, and remits payment (based on daily AUM over time, just like now, perhaps) to Matt's Index (in a tokenized store of value, like a stable coin) in return for that instance of access. Baking in the appropriate business logic here is absolutely trivial. The programming language used for smart contracts, Solidity, is ludicrously straightforward for anyone who has ever learned JavaScript (which at this point should cover every programmer born since 1970).\n\nWhat's even cooler is if to imagine a world where the Fund Company side of this transaction exists entirely in the Crypto Notional economy. What if the fund itself was simply a set of cryptographic assets. Instead of own individual stocks, say, they could own tokenized stocks. This is effectively what happens over at FTX (U.S. investors need not apply). FTX runs an exchange where you can trade token pairs (I give you an apple, you give me an orange). In order to make the apples say, bitcoin, and the oranges, say, Tesla Stock, they partnered with a brokerage to essentially create a giant public dark pool. Everyone opens up dual accounts with both FTX and their Security-Notional brokerage partner, CM-Equity, and FTX allows members of the dark pool to trade these token pairs with each other, which are then mimicked in the dark pool being run by CM-Equity (essentially). Each each token, in a way, represents a share in the dark pool run by the Securities Notional partner, assigned to a certain exposure (say, a share of TSLA). It's far to complex and fraught with single-counterparty risks (my opinion, feel free to yell at me), but I get why they ended up this way. Regulators are terrified, so you have to play ball with securities laws.\n\nA far more efficient way to bridge this gap between the Security-Notional ownership of $TSLA stock and the tokenized Crypto-Notional version of TSLA would be to simply establish bridged liquidity pools. This is the topic for an entire different discussion, but essentially, the Uniswap model for managing liquidity in any pair of assets is quite elegant, and there's really no reason (other than regulation) you couldn't apply it to any single asset class.\n\nVery briefly, each notional tradable pair (say, a stable coin like USDT vs. TSLA stock) would exist as its own pool of both (some USDT and some TSLA) to create an 'Exposure Token', which is what gets traded. When it gets out of balance, prices change to create arbitrage opportunities. This is how Uniswap handles a swap between, say, Ethereum and Bitcoin:\n\n(I get that I'm shorthanding an *enormous* amount here and I apologize, but I encourage ops nerds like me to dig in. It's super cool, and embeds all sorts of economics, like paying liqudiity providers for showing up beyond just providing an arbitrage opportunity).\n\nRight now, such a bridge token would likely violate a whole pile of securities laws in the U.S. -- which is exactly what we need to fix. But lets hand-wave that. If the fund company could, instead of going and buying a bunch of stocks on the Security-Notional side of things, instead simply go and buy a bunch of Exposure Tokens on the Crypto-Notional side of things, the implications are profound:\n- A 'CryptoETF' simply becomes a collection of tokens.\n- The CryptoETF itself, now just a collection of tokens tied to an external Portfolio Token which contains the IP, can implement business logic, and itself be tokenized.\n- The CryptoETF token presents methods for automatically accessing creation and redemption -- n ew CryptoETF tokens are created or burned based using baskets of the appropriate Exposure Tokens (tokenized TSLA, tokenized gold, whatever), which could of course change at any time based on new information from the Portfolio Token.\n- Any changes to the portfolio of any kind can be 100% automated -- because all you're doing is swapping Exposure Tokens for Exposure Tokens. If the fund needs to sell some Apple and buy some Tesla, the business logic of the CryptoETF can just automatically make the paired transactions back to a decentralized exchange like Uniswap.\n- Since the CryptoETF is itself tokenized, it can be transferred through Decentralized Exchanges, presented as collateral, or just stored somewhere, all without any direct involvement of the current global securities infrastructure (that's up to the liquidity providers).\n\nMy 'aha' moment here is that all of the above is so trivial, technically. The entirety of this could be coded into Ethereum-based tokens in a weekend (by someone else, I'm tired) using existing tech. It's also 100% impossible in the current regulatory environment. These Exposure Tokens could naturally be regulated entities with any counterparty risks or structural issues backstopped by our good friends at the DTCC. While that might make crypto-evangelists break out into hives, any bridging to the Security-Notional economy is going to require a counterparty to at the very least act as custodian for the Security-Notional side of the tokens, until we actually get rid of stocks and bonds altogether and just issue ownership rights directly to a blockchain.\n\nAll this is what i meant when I said last week that the United States has a real opportunity to lead here. Really thoughtful regulatory environments could turn the United States into the de facto global capitalist engine for the next 50 years. The path we're on is one of almost complete neglect. A little poking around the edges of central bank digital currencies doesn't cut it.\n\nSo what's the to-do list? Build standards. Build a regulatory framework supporting those standards. Implement. That's how this always works. The crypto community should be working hand in hand with regulators to make this future, not in conflict with, but in collaboration with the traditional Security-Notional economy. And doing so would put the U.S. back conducting the train of global capitalism, instead of hanging out in the caboose.\n\n--\n\nA Postscript on Bitcoin: I'm a well documented Bitcoin skeptic, as I am of all psychological commodities. I am however becoming slightly less of one because of a single realization: Bitcoin, more than anything, is collateral. It's a crypto-native asset that is widely held, traded, and valued. That's why folks like FTX and Binance treat Bitcoin as nearly-cash when it comes to posting collateral into a trading account on which to earn interest or gain margin, although even there, everything is marked at a USD amount. You can build an ecosystem to get away from fiat currencies, but it's gonna be a whole 'nother matter to get away from a peg. \n\nFinal Note: Ideas are ephemeral and implementation is everything. If you're already doing all this, please let me know. I'm sorry I missed you in my google search. If you think this is a cool idea and you go build some giant thing around it, feel free to put me on your board or buy one of my tokens (grin).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n-

dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn\u2019t get buy-in to his proposal.\n\nIf you want to find out more information about Ethereum or cryptocurrencies in general, then use the search box at the top of this page.

While NFTs have been around for years, they\u2019ve drawn increased attention in recent weeks after a number of incredibly lucrative sales.\n\nSource: Vladimir Kazakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNFTs are essentially smart contracts utilizing the blockchain to make sure specific conditions are met before processing a transaction. In practice, the primary use of that feature at this time is to validate transactions and record ownership of the NFT.\n\nThe \u201cnon-fungible\u201d part of the name refers to the fact that each NFT is totally unique. For example, two people may have purchased different NFTs for the same price, but those NFTs aren\u2019t necessarily interchangeable. One might be a GIF by a renowned illustrator, while the other may be an exclusive song by a musician. And their owners may not see their exchange as one to one the same way they would an exchange of say, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC) for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHistorically, NFTs have primarily been used for digital collectibles. You can think of them as online baseball cards, or similar to purchasing a piece of art.\n\nThose digital collectibles are a big part of why NFTs have been a hot news topic of late; last week, graphic designer David Rudnick sold an NFT for 10.8 ETH (approximately $18,600) on Zora, an NFT marketplace.\n\nThis particular NFT provides a valuable case study: Rudnick himself shared a copy of the digital art piece for free online. This is one area where NFTs truly begin to differ from visual art, which derive value from not only their aesthetic value or perceived growth potential, but also their actual scarcity.\n\nNFTs however, can become more valuable by virtue of being shared widely. Some liken this to buying a print of a painting, as opposed to owning it outright. Yes, I can put up a poster of the Mona Lisa in my home, but its not the real deal, even if it looks exactly the same. And by owning a poster of the Mona Lisa, I\u2019m adding to the perceived cultural value of the original work.\n\nDue to the blockchain nature of NFTs, creators can profit not only off the first point-of-sale, but also take a commission fee of subsequent resales, providing a distinct advantage for artists over traditional models. And it\u2019s not just visual artists engaged in the space.\n\nThe NBA has also gotten into the digital collectible game with its NBA Top Shot app. The app allows users to purchase certificates of ownership for game highlight videos, such as a particularly strong block by Zion Williamson.\n\nMeanwhile, in the music world, producers are releasing sample packs and exclusive music via NFTs.\n\nOne potentially lucrative future application of NFTs might be concert tickets. Given that NFTs are smart contracts, the blockchain could validate rules for tickets to set a ceiling on resale prices and how often a ticket can change ownership before the show.\n\nThere are also NFT applications in gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) to consider.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to say where NFTs go next, surging interest suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of the technology being more broadly adopted, similar to how increasing use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies led to their widespread acceptance today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin Rally Shows No Signs of Slowing Down, Despite Skepticism", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace via Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/aTiiw1BymRyBs35FB7nfpw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investorplace_417/a5da9b958d3206caa936b055b1271e81", "auther": "Faizan Farooque", "body": "Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is on a wild run of epic proportions, with no signs of stopping. Earlier in February, the digital currency\u2019s market value exceeded $1 trillion, according to Coindesk. Even now, several investors remain skeptical about putting their capital into the asset. However, the writing is on the wall.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInstitutional interest in Bitcoin is at an all-time high. Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), the nation\u2019s oldest bank, is paving the way for Bitcoin to use the networks usually reserved for conventional financial assets. Not so long ago, major custodian banks stayed away from the space due to regulatory or legal risks. However, client demand is forcing them to reevaluate their positions.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin according to a regulatory filing. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that Tesla has made approximately $1 billion in paper profits from the investment thus far.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnline payment processing companies PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ) have already allowed their users to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin. PayPal, in particular, is a real coup for Bitcoin. As of the end of 2020, it had total active accounts of 377 million.\n\nThe overarching theme is that the rally in Bitcoin prices is forcing the world\u2019s largest publicly traded financial services companies and major Wall Street giants to rethink their approach. That\u2019s why one shouldn\u2019t be skeptical of investing in the space at the moment. Bitcoin is finally going mainstream, and although there will be blips on the way, the trajectory is upward.\n\nChances are that if you read the news, the Bitcoin rally is something you are aware of. The cryptocurrency had a smashing 2020, rocketing to $20,000 from around $1,000. Due to the epic bull run, many investors compared the situation to the last time the digital currency went parabolic back in 2017.\n-  8 Risky Stocks to Buy If Danger Is Your Middle Name \n\nHowever, there are several key differences in the current run with the one we had back in 2017. Firstly, it may seem surprising, but the 2020-2021 run is less extreme than the last one. In that case, we saw a 20x return while the last year was roughly an 8x return.\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that in 2017 several projects kicked off as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), leading to massive runups for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), Ripple (CCC:XRP-USD), and their ilk. In fact, the other cryptos surpassed the Bitcoin rally and then some.\n\nCut to the current run, and it\u2019s the complete opposite. Bitcoin is leading the charge, with several cryptos rising in its shadow, rather than the other way around. CryptoCompare data shows the trading volumes for the digital currency on the eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk 20 have exceeded $11 billion, beating the 2017 all-time record.\n\nLastly, Bitcoin is going mainstream. Everyone wants to take advantage of the massive rally, and that\u2019s why you see massive financial institutions jump on the bandwagon as well. I\u2019ve gone through several major companies that have embraced digital currency, but I want to single out Mastercard\u2019s (NYSE:MA) recent announcement before moving to the next section. It has said that it will support \u201cselect cryptocurrencies\u201d on its network in the latter half of the year.\n\nAnother instance of corporate America warming up to Bitcoin.\n\nDespite the amazing bull run, there are still several skeptics out there. I would classify them into two categories. One set doesn\u2019t believe in the inherent story of Bitcoin, equating it to the tulip mania of 1637. The other group feels valuation is stretched at this point, and bubble bursting will make their investment worthless. We\u2019ve already addressed the concerns of the latter through this article. But the first set merits further discussion.\n\nEssentially, these are coming from the Warren Buffet school of investing. The Oracle of Omaha has steered clear of investing in Bitcoin and has laid out his reasons. Firstly, the billionaire investor only pours capital into areas that he understands.\n\nAdditionally, he has a firm \u201cbuy and hold\u201d strategy based on years of investing experience. He has held onto companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) because he believes in their story. These companies produce stable recurring cash flow based on their excellent business models. However, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have that. So, Buffet prefers to stay away.\n\nIf you are reading this and that strategy sounds a lot like how you invest, then it\u2019s tough work to convince you. However, if you have held this digital asset for a while, the ebbs and flows are not new.\n\nWhat keeps you interested in Bitcoin is the prospect of making 10 times on your investment. And there are no signs at the moment that stormy days are ahead for the cryptocurrency, which is finally getting a seat at the table in the investing world.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. \n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

That's quite literally the point of your broker. They sit between the Cash Economy and the Security-Notional economy and help you transact in the later. You allocate money from your cash into, say, an ETF. That ETF is nothing more than a slice of intellectual property (IP), whether they come from MSCI as part of an index, or from Cathie Wood's team at ARK Invest. That IP is then implemented through trades in underlying securities, through in kind creations or by taking cash from an Authorized Participant, and dozens of other fun but shockingly complex bits of work happen under the hood to keep the portfolio trued up (corporate actions, splits, M&A, securities lending, etc.) You can imagine it a bit like this:\n\nSo what are you really paying for? Well, sometimes the IP involved is expensive, and unique (like, say, the active management of ARKK). Sometimes it's relatively simple and loaded with competition (like, say, MSCI's large cap U.S. Index). You as an investor should expect to pay accordingly. You're also paying for all the other stuff, but that tends to be relatively inexpensive. If your ETF is in U.S. stocks, you'd expect it to be cheap, but if its emerging market local currency debt with hedging overlays? Well, you'd expect to pay a bit more.\n\nLet's tease this out and try to imagine the most efficient way this could work. The actual IP here is trivial to package up. It's just a continuous broadcast of portfolio state, a carnival barker yelling \"STEP RIGHT UP AND SEE TODAY'S S&P 500.\" In the world of modern data, there's little difference between publishing that daily in the Wall St. Journal and building an API that a computer could poke at on demand to get constituents. Even the most active manager does essentially the same thing: they just say what the contents of the IP are, all the time.\n\nIn order to get paid for that IP, we've created all sorts of systems. Most involve you literally giving the money to the IP holder, and letting them handle the rest. If you want access to ARK, you can buy a mutual fund or an ETF, or if you're big enough, open up an SMA. But regardless, you move money across the notional barrier from your pile of cash into some Security-Notional vehicle, which ARK then manages. But what you're really looking for is the IP. Index providers get paid a little differently - they license their intellectual property to pretty much anyone, but the real money is in licensing it to fund managers who package it up into ETFs and funds of their own. They also license their IP to media, researchers, data providers, and so on.\n\nThe implementation part turns out to be relatively annoying. So much so that we've created all sorts of products to avoid it: index futures in particular were created to avoid the friction of implementation (among other things). So were 'synthetic ETFs' in Europe or Exchange-Traded Notes here in the U.S., and of course a huge chunk of the derivatives markets from swaps to structured notes. The IP is what matters. The implementation is just friction.\n\nThe New Hotness, in case you missed it, is 'Non-Fungible Tokens' or NFTs. The idea of an NFT is pretty simple: it's simply a digital blob that can't be duplicated, and it is one of a kind. This is distinct from Bitcoin, which are digital blobs of which there are currently 18 million. Yours is exactly as useful as mine. With an NFT, you make a one and done for each token. You can 'burn' it, but you can't change it, and it's unique. This the idea behind the widely popularized NBA TopShot digital collectible ... THINGS.\n\nA Sidebar for Nerds: I am hung up on digital objects having utility, and I'm trying to get past it. I have opened countless 'digital packs' of 'digital cards' that I paid real money for to play a game called Magic: The Gathering. Those fake things had real utility to me, because I enjoy playing a game that I can only play if I have those cards. I have absolutely no emotional attachment to my ownership of them. At the very same time, I don't, at my core, understand or appreciate the value of a piece of digital artwork which I could see in my browser right now for free, just because you tell me mine's 'official'. Give me copyright and let me put it on my business cards or sell it to Getty Images? Sure. But just to know I own one of 100 \"real\" copies that is now mine? Nope. I am 100% aware of the ridiculous double standard here, and I am not suggesting I'm correct. I'm saying it's where I'm at right now.\n\nEach card in a TopShot pack, or each piece of digital artwork on Rarible, OpenSea, or a dozen other platforms, is usually just a Smart Contract tied to the Ethereum network. (I wrote a bit about smart contracts last week, but in short, they take a bunch of business logic, embed it in a piece of publicly accessible code in the Ethereum blockchain, and run as cloud-computing applications using ETH as the way you pay for computing cycles. They're cool.)\n\nNFT's 'wrap' other objects inside their smart contracts. So for example, if you buy a piece of digital art, the literal image could be wrapped in the token (the ones and zeros that make the GIF), or more likely, the token wraps a digital key that in turn unlocks a much higher resolution version. Since the token itself can be moved around and interacted with, there's a cost to both how complex and how big the tokens can be in practice.\n\nWhat you put into an NFT is entirely about trust. The NBA is wrapping up MP4s (or keys to them) in the body of their NFT. Other artists are putting keys to unlock music. I went to Rarible last night and minted 5 Non-Fungible Tokens of my own. I used their point-and-click tools and did no programming whatsoever.\n\nSince I have no real talent, I decided the thing I would sell was an item of external trust. If you buy one of these tokens, all you own is my promise. And my promise is minted on the token: you can transfer the token back to me (which I will then destroy or resell), in return for me giving you one hour of my life.\n\n(I am not expecting anyone to buy these. I'm making a bit of a point here: you can wrap anything in a smart contract, as long as you have a trust bridge. In this case the trust bridge is my word. If you think I'm unreliable, my promise is worthless. If you think I'm a person of my word, then the token is actually worth one of the projected 700,000 hours of my life. But feel free to buy it if you like!)\n\nThe process was relatively simple, but it wasn't free. In order to mint these 5 tokens, I had to pay 'Gas' to mint my contracts and make them available for people to buy. Gas is the computational currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Minting my tokens meant I sent a set of code out to the blockchain. When some miner minted a new ETH block, my work was done (and I paid him, in Gas). My cost for this was about $40 at current ETH prices and the load of the network last night. To participate in this weirdness, I had to join the Crypto Notional economy. I had to purchase a little bit of ETH (which I did at Coinbase). Because I need a 'hard' wallet -- a specific address on the blockchain that my new NFT's belong to and are minted by -- I had to move my ETH from Coinbase over to Metamask (one of many web-based hard wallets). I could also have used a wallet on my phone, or even resorted to writing a long string on paper somewhere.\n\nOnce I spent some cash at Coinbase to get into the crypto side of the house, everything that happens with this token happens only in the Crypto Notional economy. If you want to buy one of my tokens (guaranteed only one of 700,000 it would be possible to make!), you're going to owe me an ETH (the minimum Rarible lets you mint a token for, I'm not that much of a egotist). How much this is worth to you, as a buyer, will depend on at least two things: how much you value Ethereum, and how much you value an hour of my time. It would be easy to say \"well, the first is just an exchange rate,\" but since we both now need ETH to interact, (and it's easy to imagine all the internety-things ETH could be used for), ETH has utility beyond its simple conversion back and forth to USD. It is itself a useful good required to buy computing cycles from the cloud to implement smart contracts.\n\nOne really cool and still somewhat nascent feature of smart contracts is the idea of an Oracle. An Oracle is an external provider of data to a smart contract. So for example, if you have a contract that pays out on who wins a presidential election, you could assign a specific Oracle to have the contract consult to determine who won (Associated Press, etc). The beauty of such a system is that you can have information enter the smart contract without any human involvement and without creating a giant bloated mass of a smart contract which would cost far too much gas to run.\n\nPut another way, an Oracle to a Smart Contract is simply a way of accessing a piece of intellectual property that lives OFF OF the blockchain - the state of an external data set. So what if a PM or an Index provider, instead of running money, simply provided an oracle: an API that any (approved, secured) system could talk to which told the requestor in real time what a given portfolio looks like: 4% AAPL, 2% TSLA, etc. (This is essentially what CRSP does right now in their partnership with Symbiont and Vanguard, but to my understanding, that's effectively a closed network, in the same way FedWire is. They just use blockchain for fault tolerance and efficiency.)\n\nSo this part is pretty well trod: baking portfolio IP into a blockchain. What's the next step? Getting paid.\n\nWhen you buy an NFT, you're not just buying whatever IP got wrapped up in the contract, you're also getting access to a whole set of business logic coded into the NFT. In the dominant standard for digital art, ETC-721, a standard for paying royalties exists (and is part of my NadigHour tokens). If you decide to sell my token to Elon Musk for $1 million in a decade because I discovered the secret to time travel and it's a collectible (I won't, and it won't be), 10% of that transaction will get funneled back to the same ETH address I used to mint the coins. That's really cool for, say, an artist who's actually selling copyrights.\n\nBut back to indexing: coding up a smart contract to access an oracle that happens to return the constituents of an index or portfolio is pretty much trivial, but so what? If we stopped right here, what we have is a really interesting way of getting IP into direct indexing accounts. After all, this could just power all my fractional share trades at OSAM's Canvas or whatever Schwab launches this year. That's just a fun new way of sending a spreadsheet, often, with a lot of security and transaction history.\n\nBut what if a new kind of ETF (call it the CryptoETF) could access this information as a Portfolio Token? For example, Matt's Index issues a Portfolio Token to the Dave's Large-Cap CryptoETF (cDAVE). It's a singular NFT -- it exists to create the connection between Matt's Index and the CryptoETF, and its precise terms could be negotiated. Whenever the CryptoETF wants to adjust its portfolio (could be once a day, could be every second), they access the functions of the smart contract that is part of the Portfolio Token. As part of that access, the CryptoETF presents evidence of AUM, and remits payment (based on daily AUM over time, just like now, perhaps) to Matt's Index (in a tokenized store of value, like a stable coin) in return for that instance of access. Baking in the appropriate business logic here is absolutely trivial. The programming language used for smart contracts, Solidity, is ludicrously straightforward for anyone who has ever learned JavaScript (which at this point should cover every programmer born since 1970).\n\nWhat's even cooler is if to imagine a world where the Fund Company side of this transaction exists entirely in the Crypto Notional economy. What if the fund itself was simply a set of cryptographic assets. Instead of own individual stocks, say, they could own tokenized stocks. This is effectively what happens over at FTX (U.S. investors need not apply). FTX runs an exchange where you can trade token pairs (I give you an apple, you give me an orange). In order to make the apples say, bitcoin, and the oranges, say, Tesla Stock, they partnered with a brokerage to essentially create a giant public dark pool. Everyone opens up dual accounts with both FTX and their Security-Notional brokerage partner, CM-Equity, and FTX allows members of the dark pool to trade these token pairs with each other, which are then mimicked in the dark pool being run by CM-Equity (essentially). Each each token, in a way, represents a share in the dark pool run by the Securities Notional partner, assigned to a certain exposure (say, a share of TSLA). It's far to complex and fraught with single-counterparty risks (my opinion, feel free to yell at me), but I get why they ended up this way. Regulators are terrified, so you have to play ball with securities laws.\n\nA far more efficient way to bridge this gap between the Security-Notional ownership of $TSLA stock and the tokenized Crypto-Notional version of TSLA would be to simply establish bridged liquidity pools. This is the topic for an entire different discussion, but essentially, the Uniswap model for managing liquidity in any pair of assets is quite elegant, and there's really no reason (other than regulation) you couldn't apply it to any single asset class.\n\nVery briefly, each notional tradable pair (say, a stable coin like USDT vs. TSLA stock) would exist as its own pool of both (some USDT and some TSLA) to create an 'Exposure Token', which is what gets traded. When it gets out of balance, prices change to create arbitrage opportunities. This is how Uniswap handles a swap between, say, Ethereum and Bitcoin:\n\n(I get that I'm shorthanding an *enormous* amount here and I apologize, but I encourage ops nerds like me to dig in. It's super cool, and embeds all sorts of economics, like paying liqudiity providers for showing up beyond just providing an arbitrage opportunity).\n\nRight now, such a bridge token would likely violate a whole pile of securities laws in the U.S. -- which is exactly what we need to fix. But lets hand-wave that. If the fund company could, instead of going and buying a bunch of stocks on the Security-Notional side of things, instead simply go and buy a bunch of Exposure Tokens on the Crypto-Notional side of things, the implications are profound:\n- A 'CryptoETF' simply becomes a collection of tokens.\n- The CryptoETF itself, now just a collection of tokens tied to an external Portfolio Token which contains the IP, can implement business logic, and itself be tokenized.\n- The CryptoETF token presents methods for automatically accessing creation and redemption -- n ew CryptoETF tokens are created or burned based using baskets of the appropriate Exposure Tokens (tokenized TSLA, tokenized gold, whatever), which could of course change at any time based on new information from the Portfolio Token.\n- Any changes to the portfolio of any kind can be 100% automated -- because all you're doing is swapping Exposure Tokens for Exposure Tokens. If the fund needs to sell some Apple and buy some Tesla, the business logic of the CryptoETF can just automatically make the paired transactions back to a decentralized exchange like Uniswap.\n- Since the CryptoETF is itself tokenized, it can be transferred through Decentralized Exchanges, presented as collateral, or just stored somewhere, all without any direct involvement of the current global securities infrastructure (that's up to the liquidity providers).\n\nMy 'aha' moment here is that all of the above is so trivial, technically. The entirety of this could be coded into Ethereum-based tokens in a weekend (by someone else, I'm tired) using existing tech. It's also 100% impossible in the current regulatory environment. These Exposure Tokens could naturally be regulated entities with any counterparty risks or structural issues backstopped by our good friends at the DTCC. While that might make crypto-evangelists break out into hives, any bridging to the Security-Notional economy is going to require a counterparty to at the very least act as custodian for the Security-Notional side of the tokens, until we actually get rid of stocks and bonds altogether and just issue ownership rights directly to a blockchain.\n\nAll this is what i meant when I said last week that the United States has a real opportunity to lead here. Really thoughtful regulatory environments could turn the United States into the de facto global capitalist engine for the next 50 years. The path we're on is one of almost complete neglect. A little poking around the edges of central bank digital currencies doesn't cut it.\n\nSo what's the to-do list? Build standards. Build a regulatory framework supporting those standards. Implement. That's how this always works. The crypto community should be working hand in hand with regulators to make this future, not in conflict with, but in collaboration with the traditional Security-Notional economy. And doing so would put the U.S. back conducting the train of global capitalism, instead of hanging out in the caboose.\n\n--\n\nA Postscript on Bitcoin: I'm a well documented Bitcoin skeptic, as I am of all psychological commodities. I am however becoming slightly less of one because of a single realization: Bitcoin, more than anything, is collateral. It's a crypto-native asset that is widely held, traded, and valued. That's why folks like FTX and Binance treat Bitcoin as nearly-cash when it comes to posting collateral into a trading account on which to earn interest or gain margin, although even there, everything is marked at a USD amount. You can build an ecosystem to get away from fiat currencies, but it's gonna be a whole 'nother matter to get away from a peg. \n\nFinal Note: Ideas are ephemeral and implementation is everything. If you're already doing all this, please let me know. I'm sorry I missed you in my google search. If you think this is a cool idea and you go build some giant thing around it, feel free to put me on your board or buy one of my tokens (grin).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n-

While NFTs have been around for years, they\u2019ve drawn increased attention in recent weeks after a number of incredibly lucrative sales.\n\nSource: Vladimir Kazakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNFTs are essentially smart contracts utilizing the blockchain to make sure specific conditions are met before processing a transaction. In practice, the primary use of that feature at this time is to validate transactions and record ownership of the NFT.\n\nThe \u201cnon-fungible\u201d part of the name refers to the fact that each NFT is totally unique. For example, two people may have purchased different NFTs for the same price, but those NFTs aren\u2019t necessarily interchangeable. One might be a GIF by a renowned illustrator, while the other may be an exclusive song by a musician. And their owners may not see their exchange as one to one the same way they would an exchange of say, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC) for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHistorically, NFTs have primarily been used for digital collectibles. You can think of them as online baseball cards, or similar to purchasing a piece of art.\n\nThose digital collectibles are a big part of why NFTs have been a hot news topic of late; last week, graphic designer David Rudnick sold an NFT for 10.8 ETH (approximately $18,600) on Zora, an NFT marketplace.\n\nThis particular NFT provides a valuable case study: Rudnick himself shared a copy of the digital art piece for free online. This is one area where NFTs truly begin to differ from visual art, which derive value from not only their aesthetic value or perceived growth potential, but also their actual scarcity.\n\nNFTs however, can become more valuable by virtue of being shared widely. Some liken this to buying a print of a painting, as opposed to owning it outright. Yes, I can put up a poster of the Mona Lisa in my home, but its not the real deal, even if it looks exactly the same. And by owning a poster of the Mona Lisa, I\u2019m adding to the perceived cultural value of the original work.\n\nDue to the blockchain nature of NFTs, creators can profit not only off the first point-of-sale, but also take a commission fee of subsequent resales, providing a distinct advantage for artists over traditional models. And it\u2019s not just visual artists engaged in the space.\n\nThe NBA has also gotten into the digital collectible game with its NBA Top Shot app. The app allows users to purchase certificates of ownership for game highlight videos, such as a particularly strong block by Zion Williamson.\n\nMeanwhile, in the music world, producers are releasing sample packs and exclusive music via NFTs.\n\nOne potentially lucrative future application of NFTs might be concert tickets. Given that NFTs are smart contracts, the blockchain could validate rules for tickets to set a ceiling on resale prices and how often a ticket can change ownership before the show.\n\nThere are also NFT applications in gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) to consider.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to say where NFTs go next, surging interest suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of the technology being more broadly adopted, similar to how increasing use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies led to their widespread acceptance today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

CryptoCompare data shows the trading volumes for the digital currency on the eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk 20 have exceeded $11 billion, beating the 2017 all-time record.\n\nLastly, Bitcoin is going mainstream. Everyone wants to take advantage of the massive rally, and that\u2019s why you see massive financial institutions jump on the bandwagon as well. I\u2019ve gone through several major companies that have embraced digital currency, but I want to single out Mastercard\u2019s (NYSE:MA) recent announcement before moving to the next section. It has said that it will support \u201cselect cryptocurrencies\u201d on its network in the latter half of the year.\n\nAnother instance of corporate America warming up to Bitcoin.\n\nDespite the amazing bull run, there are still several skeptics out there. I would classify them into two categories. One set doesn\u2019t believe in the inherent story of Bitcoin, equating it to the tulip mania of 1637. The other group feels valuation is stretched at this point, and bubble bursting will make their investment worthless. We\u2019ve already addressed the concerns of the latter through this article. But the first set merits further discussion.\n\nEssentially, these are coming from the Warren Buffet school of investing. The Oracle of Omaha has steered clear of investing in Bitcoin and has laid out his reasons. Firstly, the billionaire investor only pours capital into areas that he understands.\n\nAdditionally, he has a firm \u201cbuy and hold\u201d strategy based on years of investing experience. He has held onto companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) because he believes in their story. These companies produce stable recurring cash flow based on their excellent business models. However, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have that. So, Buffet prefers to stay away.\n\nIf you are reading this and that strategy sounds a lot like how you invest, then it\u2019s tough work to convince you. However, if you have held this digital asset for a while, the ebbs and flows are not new.\n\nWhat keeps you interested in Bitcoin is the prospect of making 10 times on your investment. And there are no signs at the moment that stormy days are ahead for the cryptocurrency, which is finally getting a seat at the table in the investing world.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. \n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

And hide from these days we remained all alone. Staying in the same place, just staying out the time. Touching from a distance, Further all the time.\" Joy Division, Transmission\n\nOver the last few weeks I've been digging deep into my own assumptions about how the world works. I've seen enough cool stuff fly by to (occasionally) recognize when I should keep my mouth shut until I actually wade into a topic. That's largely how I've felt about Crypto. When Bitcoin took off about a decade ago, I did the obligatory amount of reading most nerds did, chuckled at all my Young Turk analysts buying Bitcoin for $49 or whatever it was at the time. I adopted the fashionable \"Tsk, Bitcoin, but Hrm, blockchain?\" stance that still pervades most of finance on the 'Security-Notional' side of the balance sheet -- the world of stocks and bonds and futures and options and all that jazz. I wasn't paying enough attention.\n\nI'm not writing this for all of you deep crypto nerds -- y'all are the ones I'm learning from. I fully expect y'all to:\n- Light me up over everything I've got wrong.\n- Point out the people and groups that already figured this out, but whom I couldn't find on Google this weekend.\n\nBut for the rest of you:\n\nLet's start by thinking about what the whole point of a mutual fund or ETF or SMA or CIT is to you as the investor. You move money from the Cash economy (where we actually accumulate and spend dollars) to the Security-Notional economy (where we own assets we mark to a \"price\") through a brokerage account. That's quite literally the point of your broker. They sit between the Cash Economy and the Security-Notional economy and help you transact in the later. You allocate money from your cash into, say, an ETF. That ETF is nothing more than a slice of intellectual property (IP), whether they come from MSCI as part of an index, or from Cathie Wood's team at ARK Invest. That IP is then implemented through trades in underlying securities, through in kind creations or by taking cash from an Authorized Participant, and dozens of other fun but shockingly complex bits of work happen under the hood to keep the portfolio trued up (corporate actions, splits, M&A, securities lending, etc.) You can imagine it a bit like this:\n\nSo what are you really paying for? Well, sometimes the IP involved is expensive, and unique (like, say, the active management of ARKK). Sometimes it's relatively simple and loaded with competition (like, say, MSCI's large cap U.S. Index). You as an investor should expect to pay accordingly. You're also paying for all the other stuff, but that tends to be relatively inexpensive. If your ETF is in U.S. stocks, you'd expect it to be cheap, but if its emerging market local currency debt with hedging overlays? Well, you'd expect to pay a bit more.\n\nLet's tease this out and try to imagine the most efficient way this could work. The actual IP here is trivial to package up. It's just a continuous broadcast of portfolio state, a carnival barker yelling \"STEP RIGHT UP AND SEE TODAY'S S&P 500.\" In the world of modern data, there's little difference between publishing that daily in the Wall St. Journal and building an API that a computer could poke at on demand to get constituents. Even the most active manager does essentially the same thing: they just say what the contents of the IP are, all the time.\n\nIn order to get paid for that IP, we've created all sorts of systems. Most involve you literally giving the money to the IP holder, and letting them handle the rest. If you want access to ARK, you can buy a mutual fund or an ETF, or if you're big enough, open up an SMA. But regardless, you move money across the notional barrier from your pile of cash into some Security-Notional vehicle, which ARK then manages. But what you're really looking for is the IP. Index providers get paid a little differently - they license their intellectual property to pretty much anyone, but the real money is in licensing it to fund managers who package it up into ETFs and funds of their own. They also license their IP to media, researchers, data providers, and so on.\n\nThe implementation part turns out to be relatively annoying. So much so that we've created all sorts of products to avoid it: index futures in particular were created to avoid the friction of implementation (among other things). So were 'synthetic ETFs' in Europe or Exchange-Traded Notes here in the U.S., and of course a huge chunk of the derivatives markets from swaps to structured notes. The IP is what matters. The implementation is just friction.\n\nThe New Hotness, in case you missed it, is 'Non-Fungible Tokens' or NFTs. The idea of an NFT is pretty simple: it's simply a digital blob that can't be duplicated, and it is one of a kind. This is distinct from Bitcoin, which are digital blobs of which there are currently 18 million. Yours is exactly as useful as mine. With an NFT, you make a one and done for each token. You can 'burn' it, but you can't change it, and it's unique. This the idea behind the widely popularized NBA TopShot digital collectible ... THINGS.\n\nA Sidebar for Nerds: I am hung up on digital objects having utility, and I'm trying to get past it. I have opened countless 'digital packs' of 'digital cards' that I paid real money for to play a game called Magic: The Gathering. Those fake things had real utility to me, because I enjoy playing a game that I can only play if I have those cards. I have absolutely no emotional attachment to my ownership of them. At the very same time, I don't, at my core, understand or appreciate the value of a piece of digital artwork which I could see in my browser right now for free, just because you tell me mine's 'official'. Give me copyright and let me put it on my business cards or sell it to Getty Images? Sure. But just to know I own one of 100 \"real\" copies that is now mine? Nope. I am 100% aware of the ridiculous double standard here, and I am not suggesting I'm correct. I'm saying it's where I'm at right now.\n\nEach card in a TopShot pack, or each piece of digital artwork on Rarible, OpenSea, or a dozen other platforms, is usually just a Smart Contract tied to the Ethereum network. (I wrote a bit about smart contracts last week, but in short, they take a bunch of business logic, embed it in a piece of publicly accessible code in the Ethereum blockchain, and run as cloud-computing applications using ETH as the way you pay for computing cycles. They're cool.)\n\nNFT's 'wrap' other objects inside their smart contracts. So for example, if you buy a piece of digital art, the literal image could be wrapped in the token (the ones and zeros that make the GIF), or more likely, the token wraps a digital key that in turn unlocks a much higher resolution version. Since the token itself can be moved around and interacted with, there's a cost to both how complex and how big the tokens can be in practice.\n\nWhat you put into an NFT is entirely about trust. The NBA is wrapping up MP4s (or keys to them) in the body of their NFT. Other artists are putting keys to unlock music. I went to Rarible last night and minted 5 Non-Fungible Tokens of my own. I used their point-and-click tools and did no programming whatsoever.\n\nSince I have no real talent, I decided the thing I would sell was an item of external trust. If you buy one of these tokens, all you own is my promise. And my promise is minted on the token: you can transfer the token back to me (which I will then destroy or resell), in return for me giving you one hour of my life.\n\n(I am not expecting anyone to buy these. I'm making a bit of a point here: you can wrap anything in a smart contract, as long as you have a trust bridge. In this case the trust bridge is my word. If you think I'm unreliable, my promise is worthless. If you think I'm a person of my word, then the token is actually worth one of the projected 700,000 hours of my life. But feel free to buy it if you like!)\n\nThe process was relatively simple, but it wasn't free. In order to mint these 5 tokens, I had to pay 'Gas' to mint my contracts and make them available for people to buy. Gas is the computational currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Minting my tokens meant I sent a set of code out to the blockchain. When some miner minted a new ETH block, my work was done (and I paid him, in Gas). My cost for this was about $40 at current ETH prices and the load of the network last night. To participate in this weirdness, I had to join the Crypto Notional economy. I had to purchase a little bit of ETH (which I did at Coinbase). Because I need a 'hard' wallet -- a specific address on the blockchain that my new NFT's belong to and are minted by -- I had to move my ETH from Coinbase over to Metamask (one of many web-based hard wallets). I could also have used a wallet on my phone, or even resorted to writing a long string on paper somewhere.\n\nOnce I spent some cash at Coinbase to get into the crypto side of the house, everything that happens with this token happens only in the Crypto Notional economy. If you want to buy one of my tokens (guaranteed only one of 700,000 it would be possible to make!), you're going to owe me an ETH (the minimum Rarible lets you mint a token for, I'm not that much of a egotist). How much this is worth to you, as a buyer, will depend on at least two things: how much you value Ethereum, and how much you value an hour of my time. It would be easy to say \"well, the first is just an exchange rate,\" but since we both now need ETH to interact, (and it's easy to imagine all the internety-things ETH could be used for), ETH has utility beyond its simple conversion back and forth to USD. It is itself a useful good required to buy computing cycles from the cloud to implement smart contracts.\n\nOne really cool and still somewhat nascent feature of smart contracts is the idea of an Oracle. An Oracle is an external provider of data to a smart contract. So for example, if you have a contract that pays out on who wins a presidential election, you could assign a specific Oracle to have the contract consult to determine who won (Associated Press, etc). The beauty of such a system is that you can have information enter the smart contract without any human involvement and without creating a giant bloated mass of a smart contract which would cost far too much gas to run.\n\nPut another way, an Oracle to a Smart Contract is simply a way of accessing a piece of intellectual property that lives OFF OF the blockchain - the state of an external data set. So what if a PM or an Index provider, instead of running money, simply provided an oracle: an API that any (approved, secured) system could talk to which told the requestor in real time what a given portfolio looks like: 4% AAPL, 2% TSLA, etc. (This is essentially what CRSP does right now in their partnership with Symbiont and Vanguard, but to my understanding, that's effectively a closed network, in the same way FedWire is. They just use blockchain for fault tolerance and efficiency.)\n\nSo this part is pretty well trod: baking portfolio IP into a blockchain. What's the next step? Getting paid.\n\nWhen you buy an NFT, you're not just buying whatever IP got wrapped up in the contract, you're also getting access to a whole set of business logic coded into the NFT. In the dominant standard for digital art, ETC-721, a standard for paying royalties exists (and is part of my NadigHour tokens). If you decide to sell my token to Elon Musk for $1 million in a decade because I discovered the secret to time travel and it's a collectible (I won't, and it won't be), 10% of that transaction will get funneled back to the same ETH address I used to mint the coins. That's really cool for, say, an artist who's actually selling copyrights.\n\nBut back to indexing: coding up a smart contract to access an oracle that happens to return the constituents of an index or portfolio is pretty much trivial, but so what? If we stopped right here, what we have is a really interesting way of getting IP into direct indexing accounts. After all, this could just power all my fractional share trades at OSAM's Canvas or whatever Schwab launches this year. That's just a fun new way of sending a spreadsheet, often, with a lot of security and transaction history.\n\nBut what if a new kind of ETF (call it the CryptoETF) could access this information as a Portfolio Token? For example, Matt's Index issues a Portfolio Token to the Dave's Large-Cap CryptoETF (cDAVE). It's a singular NFT -- it exists to create the connection between Matt's Index and the CryptoETF, and its precise terms could be negotiated. Whenever the CryptoETF wants to adjust its portfolio (could be once a day, could be every second), they access the functions of the smart contract that is part of the Portfolio Token. As part of that access, the CryptoETF presents evidence of AUM, and remits payment (based on daily AUM over time, just like now, perhaps) to Matt's Index (in a tokenized store of value, like a stable coin) in return for that instance of access. Baking in the appropriate business logic here is absolutely trivial. The programming language used for smart contracts, Solidity, is ludicrously straightforward for anyone who has ever learned JavaScript (which at this point should cover every programmer born since 1970).\n\nWhat's even cooler is if to imagine a world where the Fund Company side of this transaction exists entirely in the Crypto Notional economy. What if the fund itself was simply a set of cryptographic assets. Instead of own individual stocks, say, they could own tokenized stocks. This is effectively what happens over at FTX (U.S. investors need not apply). FTX runs an exchange where you can trade token pairs (I give you an apple, you give me an orange). In order to make the apples say, bitcoin, and the oranges, say, Tesla Stock, they partnered with a brokerage to essentially create a giant public dark pool. Everyone opens up dual accounts with both FTX and their Security-Notional brokerage partner, CM-Equity, and FTX allows members of the dark pool to trade these token pairs with each other, which are then mimicked in the dark pool being run by CM-Equity (essentially). Each each token, in a way, represents a share in the dark pool run by the Securities Notional partner, assigned to a certain exposure (say, a share of TSLA). It's far to complex and fraught with single-counterparty risks (my opinion, feel free to yell at me), but I get why they ended up this way. Regulators are terrified, so you have to play ball with securities laws.\n\nA far more efficient way to bridge this gap between the Security-Notional ownership of $TSLA stock and the tokenized Crypto-Notional version of TSLA would be to simply establish bridged liquidity pools. This is the topic for an entire different discussion, but essentially, the Uniswap model for managing liquidity in any pair of assets is quite elegant, and there's really no reason (other than regulation) you couldn't apply it to any single asset class.\n\nVery briefly, each notional tradable pair (say, a stable coin like USDT vs. TSLA stock) would exist as its own pool of both (some USDT and some TSLA) to create an 'Exposure Token', which is what gets traded. When it gets out of balance, prices change to create arbitrage opportunities. This is how Uniswap handles a swap between, say, Ethereum and Bitcoin:\n\n(I get that I'm shorthanding an *enormous* amount here and I apologize, but I encourage ops nerds like me to dig in. It's super cool, and embeds all sorts of economics, like paying liqudiity providers for showing up beyond just providing an arbitrage opportunity).\n\nRight now, such a bridge token would likely violate a whole pile of securities laws in the U.S. -- which is exactly what we need to fix. But lets hand-wave that. If the fund company could, instead of going and buying a bunch of stocks on the Security-Notional side of things, instead simply go and buy a bunch of Exposure Tokens on the Crypto-Notional side of things, the implications are profound:\n- A 'CryptoETF' simply becomes a collection of tokens.\n- The CryptoETF itself, now just a collection of tokens tied to an external Portfolio Token which contains the IP, can implement business logic, and itself be tokenized.\n- The CryptoETF token presents methods for automatically accessing creation and redemption -- n ew CryptoETF tokens are created or burned based using baskets of the appropriate Exposure Tokens (tokenized TSLA, tokenized gold, whatever), which could of course change at any time based on new information from the Portfolio Token.\n- Any changes to the portfolio of any kind can be 100% automated -- because all you're doing is swapping Exposure Tokens for Exposure Tokens. If the fund needs to sell some Apple and buy some Tesla, the business logic of the CryptoETF can just automatically make the paired transactions back to a decentralized exchange like Uniswap.\n- Since the CryptoETF is itself tokenized, it can be transferred through Decentralized Exchanges, presented as collateral, or just stored somewhere, all without any direct involvement of the current global securities infrastructure (that's up to the liquidity providers).\n\nMy 'aha' moment here is that all of the above is so trivial, technically. The entirety of this could be coded into Ethereum-based tokens in a weekend (by someone else, I'm tired) using existing tech. It's also 100% impossible in the current regulatory environment. These Exposure Tokens could naturally be regulated entities with any counterparty risks or structural issues backstopped by our good friends at the DTCC. While that might make crypto-evangelists break out into hives, any bridging to the Security-Notional economy is going to require a counterparty to at the very least act as custodian for the Security-Notional side of the tokens, until we actually get rid of stocks and bonds altogether and just issue ownership rights directly to a blockchain.\n\nAll this is what i meant when I said last week that the United States has a real opportunity to lead here. Really thoughtful regulatory environments could turn the United States into the de facto global capitalist engine for the next 50 years. The path we're on is one of almost complete neglect. A little poking around the edges of central bank digital currencies doesn't cut it.\n\nSo what's the to-do list? Build standards. Build a regulatory framework supporting those standards. Implement. That's how this always works. The crypto community should be working hand in hand with regulators to make this future, not in conflict with, but in collaboration with the traditional Security-Notional economy. And doing so would put the U.S. back conducting the train of global capitalism, instead of hanging out in the caboose.\n\n--\n\nA Postscript on Bitcoin: I'm a well documented Bitcoin skeptic, as I am of all psychological commodities. I am however becoming slightly less of one because of a single realization: Bitcoin, more than anything, is collateral. It's a crypto-native asset that is widely held, traded, and valued. That's why folks like FTX and Binance treat Bitcoin as nearly-cash when it comes to posting collateral into a trading account on which to earn interest or gain margin, although even there, everything is marked at a USD amount. You can build an ecosystem to get away from fiat currencies, but it's gonna be a whole 'nother matter to get away from a peg. \n\nFinal Note: Ideas are ephemeral and implementation is everything. If you're already doing all this, please let me know. I'm sorry I missed you in my google search. If you think this is a cool idea and you go build some giant thing around it, feel free to put me on your board or buy one of my tokens (grin).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n-

dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn\u2019t get buy-in to his proposal.\n\nIf you want to find out more information about Ethereum or cryptocurrencies in general, then use the search box at the top of this page.

While NFTs have been around for years, they\u2019ve drawn increased attention in recent weeks after a number of incredibly lucrative sales.\n\nSource: Vladimir Kazakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNFTs are essentially smart contracts utilizing the blockchain to make sure specific conditions are met before processing a transaction. In practice, the primary use of that feature at this time is to validate transactions and record ownership of the NFT.\n\nThe \u201cnon-fungible\u201d part of the name refers to the fact that each NFT is totally unique. For example, two people may have purchased different NFTs for the same price, but those NFTs aren\u2019t necessarily interchangeable. One might be a GIF by a renowned illustrator, while the other may be an exclusive song by a musician. And their owners may not see their exchange as one to one the same way they would an exchange of say, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC) for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHistorically, NFTs have primarily been used for digital collectibles. You can think of them as online baseball cards, or similar to purchasing a piece of art.\n\nThose digital collectibles are a big part of why NFTs have been a hot news topic of late; last week, graphic designer David Rudnick sold an NFT for 10.8 ETH (approximately $18,600) on Zora, an NFT marketplace.\n\nThis particular NFT provides a valuable case study: Rudnick himself shared a copy of the digital art piece for free online. This is one area where NFTs truly begin to differ from visual art, which derive value from not only their aesthetic value or perceived growth potential, but also their actual scarcity.\n\nNFTs however, can become more valuable by virtue of being shared widely. Some liken this to buying a print of a painting, as opposed to owning it outright. Yes, I can put up a poster of the Mona Lisa in my home, but its not the real deal, even if it looks exactly the same. And by owning a poster of the Mona Lisa, I\u2019m adding to the perceived cultural value of the original work.\n\nDue to the blockchain nature of NFTs, creators can profit not only off the first point-of-sale, but also take a commission fee of subsequent resales, providing a distinct advantage for artists over traditional models. And it\u2019s not just visual artists engaged in the space.\n\nThe NBA has also gotten into the digital collectible game with its NBA Top Shot app. The app allows users to purchase certificates of ownership for game highlight videos, such as a particularly strong block by Zion Williamson.\n\nMeanwhile, in the music world, producers are releasing sample packs and exclusive music via NFTs.\n\nOne potentially lucrative future application of NFTs might be concert tickets. Given that NFTs are smart contracts, the blockchain could validate rules for tickets to set a ceiling on resale prices and how often a ticket can change ownership before the show.\n\nThere are also NFT applications in gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) to consider.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to say where NFTs go next, surging interest suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of the technology being more broadly adopted, similar to how increasing use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies led to their widespread acceptance today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices.

Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: Arcane Research: Banking on Bitcoin \u2013 The State of Bitcoin As Collateral\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nazarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei. Gas fees are currently at historic highs with an average transaction surpassing $40 Tuesday, according to Blockchair.\n\nRelated: US Central Bank Explains 'Preconditions' for a Digital Dollar\n\nNot only will the update lessen congestion on Ethereum, but it should decrease call latency, Nazarov said.\n\n\u201cReally what OCR does is take the computation we were doing on-chain and porting it out to an off-chain environment, and that is creating a very large 10x increase in efficiency, which means we can put a lot more data on-chain,\u201d Nazarov said.\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin leads cryptocurrency market sell-off", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/vw1fdt06miUfG.jz01liHA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/1be9f990-75ae-11eb-b69e-3032bd328801", "auther": "Oscar Williams-Grut", "body": "A sharp and broad-based sell-off has hit the cryptocurrency market, piercing a recent bull run powered by corporate and retail interest alike.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

Earlier in February, the digital currency\u2019s market value exceeded $1 trillion, according to Coindesk. Even now, several investors remain skeptical about putting their capital into the asset. However, the writing is on the wall.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInstitutional interest in Bitcoin is at an all-time high. Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), the nation\u2019s oldest bank, is paving the way for Bitcoin to use the networks usually reserved for conventional financial assets. Not so long ago, major custodian banks stayed away from the space due to regulatory or legal risks. However, client demand is forcing them to reevaluate their positions.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin according to a regulatory filing. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that Tesla has made approximately $1 billion in paper profits from the investment thus far.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnline payment processing companies PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ) have already allowed their users to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin. PayPal, in particular, is a real coup for Bitcoin. As of the end of 2020, it had total active accounts of 377 million.\n\nThe overarching theme is that the rally in Bitcoin prices is forcing the world\u2019s largest publicly traded financial services companies and major Wall Street giants to rethink their approach. That\u2019s why one shouldn\u2019t be skeptical of investing in the space at the moment. Bitcoin is finally going mainstream, and although there will be blips on the way, the trajectory is upward.\n\nChances are that if you read the news, the Bitcoin rally is something you are aware of. The cryptocurrency had a smashing 2020, rocketing to $20,000 from around $1,000. Due to the epic bull run, many investors compared the situation to the last time the digital currency went parabolic back in 2017.\n-  8 Risky Stocks to Buy If Danger Is Your Middle Name \n\nHowever, there are several key differences in the current run with the one we had back in 2017. Firstly, it may seem surprising, but the 2020-2021 run is less extreme than the last one. In that case, we saw a 20x return while the last year was roughly an 8x return.\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that in 2017 several projects kicked off as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), leading to massive runups for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), Ripple (CCC:XRP-USD), and their ilk. In fact, the other cryptos surpassed the Bitcoin rally and then some.\n\nCut to the current run, and it\u2019s the complete opposite. Bitcoin is leading the charge, with several cryptos rising in its shadow, rather than the other way around. CryptoCompare data shows the trading volumes for the digital currency on the eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk 20 have exceeded $11 billion, beating the 2017 all-time record.\n\nLastly, Bitcoin is going mainstream. Everyone wants to take advantage of the massive rally, and that\u2019s why you see massive financial institutions jump on the bandwagon as well. I\u2019ve gone through several major companies that have embraced digital currency, but I want to single out Mastercard\u2019s (NYSE:MA) recent announcement before moving to the next section. It has said that it will support \u201cselect cryptocurrencies\u201d on its network in the latter half of the year.\n\nAnother instance of corporate America warming up to Bitcoin.\n\nDespite the amazing bull run, there are still several skeptics out there. I would classify them into two categories. One set doesn\u2019t believe in the inherent story of Bitcoin, equating it to the tulip mania of 1637. The other group feels valuation is stretched at this point, and bubble bursting will make their investment worthless. We\u2019ve already addressed the concerns of the latter through this article. But the first set merits further discussion.\n\nEssentially, these are coming from the Warren Buffet school of investing. The Oracle of Omaha has steered clear of investing in Bitcoin and has laid out his reasons. Firstly, the billionaire investor only pours capital into areas that he understands.\n\nAdditionally, he has a firm \u201cbuy and hold\u201d strategy based on years of investing experience. He has held onto companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) because he believes in their story. These companies produce stable recurring cash flow based on their excellent business models. However, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have that. So, Buffet prefers to stay away.\n\nIf you are reading this and that strategy sounds a lot like how you invest, then it\u2019s tough work to convince you. However, if you have held this digital asset for a while, the ebbs and flows are not new.\n\nWhat keeps you interested in Bitcoin is the prospect of making 10 times on your investment. And there are no signs at the moment that stormy days are ahead for the cryptocurrency, which is finally getting a seat at the table in the investing world.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. \n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

And hide from these days we remained all alone. Staying in the same place, just staying out the time. Touching from a distance, Further all the time.\" Joy Division, Transmission\n\nOver the last few weeks I've been digging deep into my own assumptions about how the world works. I've seen enough cool stuff fly by to (occasionally) recognize when I should keep my mouth shut until I actually wade into a topic. That's largely how I've felt about Crypto. When Bitcoin took off about a decade ago, I did the obligatory amount of reading most nerds did, chuckled at all my Young Turk analysts buying Bitcoin for $49 or whatever it was at the time. I adopted the fashionable \"Tsk, Bitcoin, but Hrm, blockchain?\" stance that still pervades most of finance on the 'Security-Notional' side of the balance sheet -- the world of stocks and bonds and futures and options and all that jazz. I wasn't paying enough attention.\n\nI'm not writing this for all of you deep crypto nerds -- y'all are the ones I'm learning from. I fully expect y'all to:\n- Light me up over everything I've got wrong.\n- Point out the people and groups that already figured this out, but whom I couldn't find on Google this weekend.\n\nBut for the rest of you:\n\nLet's start by thinking about what the whole point of a mutual fund or ETF or SMA or CIT is to you as the investor. You move money from the Cash economy (where we actually accumulate and spend dollars) to the Security-Notional economy (where we own assets we mark to a \"price\") through a brokerage account. That's quite literally the point of your broker. They sit between the Cash Economy and the Security-Notional economy and help you transact in the later. You allocate money from your cash into, say, an ETF. That ETF is nothing more than a slice of intellectual property (IP), whether they come from MSCI as part of an index, or from Cathie Wood's team at ARK Invest. That IP is then implemented through trades in underlying securities, through in kind creations or by taking cash from an Authorized Participant, and dozens of other fun but shockingly complex bits of work happen under the hood to keep the portfolio trued up (corporate actions, splits, M&A, securities lending, etc.) You can imagine it a bit like this:\n\nSo what are you really paying for? Well, sometimes the IP involved is expensive, and unique (like, say, the active management of ARKK). Sometimes it's relatively simple and loaded with competition (like, say, MSCI's large cap U.S. Index). You as an investor should expect to pay accordingly. You're also paying for all the other stuff, but that tends to be relatively inexpensive. If your ETF is in U.S. stocks, you'd expect it to be cheap, but if its emerging market local currency debt with hedging overlays? Well, you'd expect to pay a bit more.\n\nLet's tease this out and try to imagine the most efficient way this could work. The actual IP here is trivial to package up. It's just a continuous broadcast of portfolio state, a carnival barker yelling \"STEP RIGHT UP AND SEE TODAY'S S&P 500.\" In the world of modern data, there's little difference between publishing that daily in the Wall St. Journal and building an API that a computer could poke at on demand to get constituents. Even the most active manager does essentially the same thing: they just say what the contents of the IP are, all the time.\n\nIn order to get paid for that IP, we've created all sorts of systems. Most involve you literally giving the money to the IP holder, and letting them handle the rest. If you want access to ARK, you can buy a mutual fund or an ETF, or if you're big enough, open up an SMA. But regardless, you move money across the notional barrier from your pile of cash into some Security-Notional vehicle, which ARK then manages. But what you're really looking for is the IP. Index providers get paid a little differently - they license their intellectual property to pretty much anyone, but the real money is in licensing it to fund managers who package it up into ETFs and funds of their own. They also license their IP to media, researchers, data providers, and so on.\n\nThe implementation part turns out to be relatively annoying. So much so that we've created all sorts of products to avoid it: index futures in particular were created to avoid the friction of implementation (among other things). So were 'synthetic ETFs' in Europe or Exchange-Traded Notes here in the U.S., and of course a huge chunk of the derivatives markets from swaps to structured notes. The IP is what matters. The implementation is just friction.\n\nThe New Hotness, in case you missed it, is 'Non-Fungible Tokens' or NFTs. The idea of an NFT is pretty simple: it's simply a digital blob that can't be duplicated, and it is one of a kind. This is distinct from Bitcoin, which are digital blobs of which there are currently 18 million. Yours is exactly as useful as mine. With an NFT, you make a one and done for each token. You can 'burn' it, but you can't change it, and it's unique. This the idea behind the widely popularized NBA TopShot digital collectible ... THINGS.\n\nA Sidebar for Nerds: I am hung up on digital objects having utility, and I'm trying to get past it. I have opened countless 'digital packs' of 'digital cards' that I paid real money for to play a game called Magic: The Gathering. Those fake things had real utility to me, because I enjoy playing a game that I can only play if I have those cards. I have absolutely no emotional attachment to my ownership of them. At the very same time, I don't, at my core, understand or appreciate the value of a piece of digital artwork which I could see in my browser right now for free, just because you tell me mine's 'official'. Give me copyright and let me put it on my business cards or sell it to Getty Images? Sure. But just to know I own one of 100 \"real\" copies that is now mine? Nope. I am 100% aware of the ridiculous double standard here, and I am not suggesting I'm correct. I'm saying it's where I'm at right now.\n\nEach card in a TopShot pack, or each piece of digital artwork on Rarible, OpenSea, or a dozen other platforms, is usually just a Smart Contract tied to the Ethereum network. (I wrote a bit about smart contracts last week, but in short, they take a bunch of business logic, embed it in a piece of publicly accessible code in the Ethereum blockchain, and run as cloud-computing applications using ETH as the way you pay for computing cycles. They're cool.)\n\nNFT's 'wrap' other objects inside their smart contracts. So for example, if you buy a piece of digital art, the literal image could be wrapped in the token (the ones and zeros that make the GIF), or more likely, the token wraps a digital key that in turn unlocks a much higher resolution version. Since the token itself can be moved around and interacted with, there's a cost to both how complex and how big the tokens can be in practice.\n\nWhat you put into an NFT is entirely about trust. The NBA is wrapping up MP4s (or keys to them) in the body of their NFT. Other artists are putting keys to unlock music. I went to Rarible last night and minted 5 Non-Fungible Tokens of my own. I used their point-and-click tools and did no programming whatsoever.\n\nSince I have no real talent, I decided the thing I would sell was an item of external trust. If you buy one of these tokens, all you own is my promise. And my promise is minted on the token: you can transfer the token back to me (which I will then destroy or resell), in return for me giving you one hour of my life.\n\n(I am not expecting anyone to buy these. I'm making a bit of a point here: you can wrap anything in a smart contract, as long as you have a trust bridge. In this case the trust bridge is my word. If you think I'm unreliable, my promise is worthless. If you think I'm a person of my word, then the token is actually worth one of the projected 700,000 hours of my life. But feel free to buy it if you like!)\n\nThe process was relatively simple, but it wasn't free. In order to mint these 5 tokens, I had to pay 'Gas' to mint my contracts and make them available for people to buy. Gas is the computational currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Minting my tokens meant I sent a set of code out to the blockchain. When some miner minted a new ETH block, my work was done (and I paid him, in Gas). My cost for this was about $40 at current ETH prices and the load of the network last night. To participate in this weirdness, I had to join the Crypto Notional economy. I had to purchase a little bit of ETH (which I did at Coinbase). Because I need a 'hard' wallet -- a specific address on the blockchain that my new NFT's belong to and are minted by -- I had to move my ETH from Coinbase over to Metamask (one of many web-based hard wallets). I could also have used a wallet on my phone, or even resorted to writing a long string on paper somewhere.\n\nOnce I spent some cash at Coinbase to get into the crypto side of the house, everything that happens with this token happens only in the Crypto Notional economy. If you want to buy one of my tokens (guaranteed only one of 700,000 it would be possible to make!), you're going to owe me an ETH (the minimum Rarible lets you mint a token for, I'm not that much of a egotist). How much this is worth to you, as a buyer, will depend on at least two things: how much you value Ethereum, and how much you value an hour of my time. It would be easy to say \"well, the first is just an exchange rate,\" but since we both now need ETH to interact, (and it's easy to imagine all the internety-things ETH could be used for), ETH has utility beyond its simple conversion back and forth to USD. It is itself a useful good required to buy computing cycles from the cloud to implement smart contracts.\n\nOne really cool and still somewhat nascent feature of smart contracts is the idea of an Oracle. An Oracle is an external provider of data to a smart contract. So for example, if you have a contract that pays out on who wins a presidential election, you could assign a specific Oracle to have the contract consult to determine who won (Associated Press, etc). The beauty of such a system is that you can have information enter the smart contract without any human involvement and without creating a giant bloated mass of a smart contract which would cost far too much gas to run.\n\nPut another way, an Oracle to a Smart Contract is simply a way of accessing a piece of intellectual property that lives OFF OF the blockchain - the state of an external data set. So what if a PM or an Index provider, instead of running money, simply provided an oracle: an API that any (approved, secured) system could talk to which told the requestor in real time what a given portfolio looks like: 4% AAPL, 2% TSLA, etc. (This is essentially what CRSP does right now in their partnership with Symbiont and Vanguard, but to my understanding, that's effectively a closed network, in the same way FedWire is. They just use blockchain for fault tolerance and efficiency.)\n\nSo this part is pretty well trod: baking portfolio IP into a blockchain. What's the next step? Getting paid.\n\nWhen you buy an NFT, you're not just buying whatever IP got wrapped up in the contract, you're also getting access to a whole set of business logic coded into the NFT. In the dominant standard for digital art, ETC-721, a standard for paying royalties exists (and is part of my NadigHour tokens). If you decide to sell my token to Elon Musk for $1 million in a decade because I discovered the secret to time travel and it's a collectible (I won't, and it won't be), 10% of that transaction will get funneled back to the same ETH address I used to mint the coins. That's really cool for, say, an artist who's actually selling copyrights.\n\nBut back to indexing: coding up a smart contract to access an oracle that happens to return the constituents of an index or portfolio is pretty much trivial, but so what? If we stopped right here, what we have is a really interesting way of getting IP into direct indexing accounts. After all, this could just power all my fractional share trades at OSAM's Canvas or whatever Schwab launches this year. That's just a fun new way of sending a spreadsheet, often, with a lot of security and transaction history.\n\nBut what if a new kind of ETF (call it the CryptoETF) could access this information as a Portfolio Token? For example, Matt's Index issues a Portfolio Token to the Dave's Large-Cap CryptoETF (cDAVE). It's a singular NFT -- it exists to create the connection between Matt's Index and the CryptoETF, and its precise terms could be negotiated. Whenever the CryptoETF wants to adjust its portfolio (could be once a day, could be every second), they access the functions of the smart contract that is part of the Portfolio Token. As part of that access, the CryptoETF presents evidence of AUM, and remits payment (based on daily AUM over time, just like now, perhaps) to Matt's Index (in a tokenized store of value, like a stable coin) in return for that instance of access. Baking in the appropriate business logic here is absolutely trivial. The programming language used for smart contracts, Solidity, is ludicrously straightforward for anyone who has ever learned JavaScript (which at this point should cover every programmer born since 1970).\n\nWhat's even cooler is if to imagine a world where the Fund Company side of this transaction exists entirely in the Crypto Notional economy. What if the fund itself was simply a set of cryptographic assets. Instead of own individual stocks, say, they could own tokenized stocks. This is effectively what happens over at FTX (U.S. investors need not apply). FTX runs an exchange where you can trade token pairs (I give you an apple, you give me an orange). In order to make the apples say, bitcoin, and the oranges, say, Tesla Stock, they partnered with a brokerage to essentially create a giant public dark pool. Everyone opens up dual accounts with both FTX and their Security-Notional brokerage partner, CM-Equity, and FTX allows members of the dark pool to trade these token pairs with each other, which are then mimicked in the dark pool being run by CM-Equity (essentially). Each each token, in a way, represents a share in the dark pool run by the Securities Notional partner, assigned to a certain exposure (say, a share of TSLA). It's far to complex and fraught with single-counterparty risks (my opinion, feel free to yell at me), but I get why they ended up this way. Regulators are terrified, so you have to play ball with securities laws.\n\nA far more efficient way to bridge this gap between the Security-Notional ownership of $TSLA stock and the tokenized Crypto-Notional version of TSLA would be to simply establish bridged liquidity pools. This is the topic for an entire different discussion, but essentially, the Uniswap model for managing liquidity in any pair of assets is quite elegant, and there's really no reason (other than regulation) you couldn't apply it to any single asset class.\n\nVery briefly, each notional tradable pair (say, a stable coin like USDT vs. TSLA stock) would exist as its own pool of both (some USDT and some TSLA) to create an 'Exposure Token', which is what gets traded. When it gets out of balance, prices change to create arbitrage opportunities. This is how Uniswap handles a swap between, say, Ethereum and Bitcoin:\n\n(I get that I'm shorthanding an *enormous* amount here and I apologize, but I encourage ops nerds like me to dig in. It's super cool, and embeds all sorts of economics, like paying liqudiity providers for showing up beyond just providing an arbitrage opportunity).\n\nRight now, such a bridge token would likely violate a whole pile of securities laws in the U.S. -- which is exactly what we need to fix. But lets hand-wave that. If the fund company could, instead of going and buying a bunch of stocks on the Security-Notional side of things, instead simply go and buy a bunch of Exposure Tokens on the Crypto-Notional side of things, the implications are profound:\n- A 'CryptoETF' simply becomes a collection of tokens.\n- The CryptoETF itself, now just a collection of tokens tied to an external Portfolio Token which contains the IP, can implement business logic, and itself be tokenized.\n- The CryptoETF token presents methods for automatically accessing creation and redemption -- n ew CryptoETF tokens are created or burned based using baskets of the appropriate Exposure Tokens (tokenized TSLA, tokenized gold, whatever), which could of course change at any time based on new information from the Portfolio Token.\n- Any changes to the portfolio of any kind can be 100% automated -- because all you're doing is swapping Exposure Tokens for Exposure Tokens. If the fund needs to sell some Apple and buy some Tesla, the business logic of the CryptoETF can just automatically make the paired transactions back to a decentralized exchange like Uniswap.\n- Since the CryptoETF is itself tokenized, it can be transferred through Decentralized Exchanges, presented as collateral, or just stored somewhere, all without any direct involvement of the current global securities infrastructure (that's up to the liquidity providers).\n\nMy 'aha' moment here is that all of the above is so trivial, technically. The entirety of this could be coded into Ethereum-based tokens in a weekend (by someone else, I'm tired) using existing tech. It's also 100% impossible in the current regulatory environment. These Exposure Tokens could naturally be regulated entities with any counterparty risks or structural issues backstopped by our good friends at the DTCC. While that might make crypto-evangelists break out into hives, any bridging to the Security-Notional economy is going to require a counterparty to at the very least act as custodian for the Security-Notional side of the tokens, until we actually get rid of stocks and bonds altogether and just issue ownership rights directly to a blockchain.\n\nAll this is what i meant when I said last week that the United States has a real opportunity to lead here. Really thoughtful regulatory environments could turn the United States into the de facto global capitalist engine for the next 50 years. The path we're on is one of almost complete neglect. A little poking around the edges of central bank digital currencies doesn't cut it.\n\nSo what's the to-do list? Build standards. Build a regulatory framework supporting those standards. Implement. That's how this always works. The crypto community should be working hand in hand with regulators to make this future, not in conflict with, but in collaboration with the traditional Security-Notional economy. And doing so would put the U.S. back conducting the train of global capitalism, instead of hanging out in the caboose.\n\n--\n\nA Postscript on Bitcoin: I'm a well documented Bitcoin skeptic, as I am of all psychological commodities. I am however becoming slightly less of one because of a single realization: Bitcoin, more than anything, is collateral. It's a crypto-native asset that is widely held, traded, and valued. That's why folks like FTX and Binance treat Bitcoin as nearly-cash when it comes to posting collateral into a trading account on which to earn interest or gain margin, although even there, everything is marked at a USD amount. You can build an ecosystem to get away from fiat currencies, but it's gonna be a whole 'nother matter to get away from a peg. \n\nFinal Note: Ideas are ephemeral and implementation is everything. If you're already doing all this, please let me know. I'm sorry I missed you in my google search. If you think this is a cool idea and you go build some giant thing around it, feel free to put me on your board or buy one of my tokens (grin).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n-

this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish

products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of

He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language.

While NFTs have been around for years, they\u2019ve drawn increased attention in recent weeks after a number of incredibly lucrative sales.\n\nSource: Vladimir Kazakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNFTs are essentially smart contracts utilizing the blockchain to make sure specific conditions are met before processing a transaction. In practice, the primary use of that feature at this time is to validate transactions and record ownership of the NFT.\n\nThe \u201cnon-fungible\u201d part of the name refers to the fact that each NFT is totally unique. For example, two people may have purchased different NFTs for the same price, but those NFTs aren\u2019t necessarily interchangeable. One might be a GIF by a renowned illustrator, while the other may be an exclusive song by a musician. And their owners may not see their exchange as one to one the same way they would an exchange of say, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC) for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHistorically, NFTs have primarily been used for digital collectibles. You can think of them as online baseball cards, or similar to purchasing a piece of art.\n\nThose digital collectibles are a big part of why NFTs have been a hot news topic of late; last week, graphic designer David Rudnick sold an NFT for 10.8 ETH (approximately $18,600) on Zora, an NFT marketplace.\n\nThis particular NFT provides a valuable case study: Rudnick himself shared a copy of the digital art piece for free online. This is one area where NFTs truly begin to differ from visual art, which derive value from not only their aesthetic value or perceived growth potential, but also their actual scarcity.\n\nNFTs however, can become more valuable by virtue of being shared widely. Some liken this to buying a print of a painting, as opposed to owning it outright. Yes, I can put up a poster of the Mona Lisa in my home, but its not the real deal, even if it looks exactly the same. And by owning a poster of the Mona Lisa, I\u2019m adding to the perceived cultural value of the original work.\n\nDue to the blockchain nature of NFTs, creators can profit not only off the first point-of-sale, but also take a commission fee of subsequent resales, providing a distinct advantage for artists over traditional models. And it\u2019s not just visual artists engaged in the space.\n\nThe NBA has also gotten into the digital collectible game with its NBA Top Shot app. The app allows users to purchase certificates of ownership for game highlight videos, such as a particularly strong block by Zion Williamson.\n\nMeanwhile, in the music world, producers are releasing sample packs and exclusive music via NFTs.\n\nOne potentially lucrative future application of NFTs might be concert tickets. Given that NFTs are smart contracts, the blockchain could validate rules for tickets to set a ceiling on resale prices and how often a ticket can change ownership before the show.\n\nThere are also NFT applications in gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) to consider.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to say where NFTs go next, surging interest suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of the technology being more broadly adopted, similar to how increasing use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies led to their widespread acceptance today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price.

Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: Arcane Research: Banking on Bitcoin \u2013 The State of Bitcoin As Collateral\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nazarov said.

Earlier in February, the digital currency\u2019s market value exceeded $1 trillion, according to Coindesk. Even now, several investors remain skeptical about putting their capital into the asset. However, the writing is on the wall.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInstitutional interest in Bitcoin is at an all-time high. Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), the nation\u2019s oldest bank, is paving the way for Bitcoin to use the networks usually reserved for conventional financial assets. Not so long ago, major custodian banks stayed away from the space due to regulatory or legal risks. However, client demand is forcing them to reevaluate their positions.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin according to a regulatory filing. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that Tesla has made approximately $1 billion in paper profits from the investment thus far.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnline payment processing companies PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ) have already allowed their users to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin. PayPal, in particular, is a real coup for Bitcoin. As of the end of 2020, it had total active accounts of 377 million.\n\nThe overarching theme is that the rally in Bitcoin prices is forcing the world\u2019s largest publicly traded financial services companies and major Wall Street giants to rethink their approach. That\u2019s why one shouldn\u2019t be skeptical of investing in the space at the moment. Bitcoin is finally going mainstream, and although there will be blips on the way, the trajectory is upward.\n\nChances are that if you read the news, the Bitcoin rally is something you are aware of. The cryptocurrency had a smashing 2020, rocketing to $20,000 from around $1,000. Due to the epic bull run, many investors compared the situation to the last time the digital currency went parabolic back in 2017.\n-  8 Risky Stocks to Buy If Danger Is Your Middle Name \n\nHowever, there are several key differences in the current run with the one we had back in 2017. Firstly, it may seem surprising, but the 2020-2021 run is less extreme than the last one. In that case, we saw a 20x return while the last year was roughly an 8x return.\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that in 2017 several projects kicked off as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), leading to massive runups for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), Ripple (CCC:XRP-USD), and their ilk. In fact, the other cryptos surpassed the Bitcoin rally and then some.\n\nCut to the current run, and it\u2019s the complete opposite. Bitcoin is leading the charge, with several cryptos rising in its shadow, rather than the other way around. CryptoCompare data shows the trading volumes for the digital currency on the eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk 20 have exceeded $11 billion, beating the 2017 all-time record.\n\nLastly, Bitcoin is going mainstream. Everyone wants to take advantage of the massive rally, and that\u2019s why you see massive financial institutions jump on the bandwagon as well. I\u2019ve gone through several major companies that have embraced digital currency, but I want to single out Mastercard\u2019s (NYSE:MA) recent announcement before moving to the next section. It has said that it will support \u201cselect cryptocurrencies\u201d on its network in the latter half of the year.\n\nAnother instance of corporate America warming up to Bitcoin.\n\nDespite the amazing bull run, there are still several skeptics out there. I would classify them into two categories. One set doesn\u2019t believe in the inherent story of Bitcoin, equating it to the tulip mania of 1637. The other group feels valuation is stretched at this point, and bubble bursting will make their investment worthless. We\u2019ve already addressed the concerns of the latter through this article. But the first set merits further discussion.\n\nEssentially, these are coming from the Warren Buffet school of investing. The Oracle of Omaha has steered clear of investing in Bitcoin and has laid out his reasons. Firstly, the billionaire investor only pours capital into areas that he understands.\n\nAdditionally, he has a firm \u201cbuy and hold\u201d strategy based on years of investing experience. He has held onto companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) because he believes in their story. These companies produce stable recurring cash flow based on their excellent business models. However, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have that. So, Buffet prefers to stay away.\n\nIf you are reading this and that strategy sounds a lot like how you invest, then it\u2019s tough work to convince you. However, if you have held this digital asset for a while, the ebbs and flows are not new.\n\nWhat keeps you interested in Bitcoin is the prospect of making 10 times on your investment. And there are no signs at the moment that stormy days are ahead for the cryptocurrency, which is finally getting a seat at the table in the investing world.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. \n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

And hide from these days we remained all alone. Staying in the same place, just staying out the time. Touching from a distance, Further all the time.\" Joy Division, Transmission\n\nOver the last few weeks I've been digging deep into my own assumptions about how the world works. I've seen enough cool stuff fly by to (occasionally) recognize when I should keep my mouth shut until I actually wade into a topic. That's largely how I've felt about Crypto. When Bitcoin took off about a decade ago, I did the obligatory amount of reading most nerds did, chuckled at all my Young Turk analysts buying Bitcoin for $49 or whatever it was at the time. I adopted the fashionable \"Tsk, Bitcoin, but Hrm, blockchain?\" stance that still pervades most of finance on the 'Security-Notional' side of the balance sheet -- the world of stocks and bonds and futures and options and all that jazz. I wasn't paying enough attention.\n\nI'm not writing this for all of you deep crypto nerds -- y'all are the ones I'm learning from. I fully expect y'all to:\n- Light me up over everything I've got wrong.\n- Point out the people and groups that already figured this out, but whom I couldn't find on Google this weekend.\n\nBut for the rest of you:\n\nLet's start by thinking about what the whole point of a mutual fund or ETF or SMA or CIT is to you as the investor. You move money from the Cash economy (where we actually accumulate and spend dollars) to the Security-Notional economy (where we own assets we mark to a \"price\") through a brokerage account. That's quite literally the point of your broker. They sit between the Cash Economy and the Security-Notional economy and help you transact in the later. You allocate money from your cash into, say, an ETF. That ETF is nothing more than a slice of intellectual property (IP), whether they come from MSCI as part of an index, or from Cathie Wood's team at ARK Invest. That IP is then implemented through trades in underlying securities, through in kind creations or by taking cash from an Authorized Participant, and dozens of other fun but shockingly complex bits of work happen under the hood to keep the portfolio trued up (corporate actions, splits, M&A, securities lending, etc.) You can imagine it a bit like this:\n\nSo what are you really paying for? Well, sometimes the IP involved is expensive, and unique (like, say, the active management of ARKK). Sometimes it's relatively simple and loaded with competition (like, say, MSCI's large cap U.S. Index). You as an investor should expect to pay accordingly. You're also paying for all the other stuff, but that tends to be relatively inexpensive. If your ETF is in U.S. stocks, you'd expect it to be cheap, but if its emerging market local currency debt with hedging overlays? Well, you'd expect to pay a bit more.\n\nLet's tease this out and try to imagine the most efficient way this could work. The actual IP here is trivial to package up. It's just a continuous broadcast of portfolio state, a carnival barker yelling \"STEP RIGHT UP AND SEE TODAY'S S&P 500.\" In the world of modern data, there's little difference between publishing that daily in the Wall St. Journal and building an API that a computer could poke at on demand to get constituents. Even the most active manager does essentially the same thing: they just say what the contents of the IP are, all the time.\n\nIn order to get paid for that IP, we've created all sorts of systems. Most involve you literally giving the money to the IP holder, and letting them handle the rest. If you want access to ARK, you can buy a mutual fund or an ETF, or if you're big enough, open up an SMA. But regardless, you move money across the notional barrier from your pile of cash into some Security-Notional vehicle, which ARK then manages. But what you're really looking for is the IP. Index providers get paid a little differently - they license their intellectual property to pretty much anyone, but the real money is in licensing it to fund managers who package it up into ETFs and funds of their own. They also license their IP to media, researchers, data providers, and so on.\n\nThe implementation part turns out to be relatively annoying. So much so that we've created all sorts of products to avoid it: index futures in particular were created to avoid the friction of implementation (among other things). So were 'synthetic ETFs' in Europe or Exchange-Traded Notes here in the U.S., and of course a huge chunk of the derivatives markets from swaps to structured notes. The IP is what matters. The implementation is just friction.\n\nThe New Hotness, in case you missed it, is 'Non-Fungible Tokens' or NFTs. The idea of an NFT is pretty simple: it's simply a digital blob that can't be duplicated, and it is one of a kind. This is distinct from Bitcoin, which are digital blobs of which there are currently 18 million. Yours is exactly as useful as mine. With an NFT, you make a one and done for each token. You can 'burn' it, but you can't change it, and it's unique. This the idea behind the widely popularized NBA TopShot digital collectible ... THINGS.\n\nA Sidebar for Nerds: I am hung up on digital objects having utility, and I'm trying to get past it. I have opened countless 'digital packs' of 'digital cards' that I paid real money for to play a game called Magic: The Gathering. Those fake things had real utility to me, because I enjoy playing a game that I can only play if I have those cards. I have absolutely no emotional attachment to my ownership of them. At the very same time, I don't, at my core, understand or appreciate the value of a piece of digital artwork which I could see in my browser right now for free, just because you tell me mine's 'official'. Give me copyright and let me put it on my business cards or sell it to Getty Images? Sure. But just to know I own one of 100 \"real\" copies that is now mine? Nope. I am 100% aware of the ridiculous double standard here, and I am not suggesting I'm correct. I'm saying it's where I'm at right now.\n\nEach card in a TopShot pack, or each piece of digital artwork on Rarible, OpenSea, or a dozen other platforms, is usually just a Smart Contract tied to the Ethereum network. (I wrote a bit about smart contracts last week, but in short, they take a bunch of business logic, embed it in a piece of publicly accessible code in the Ethereum blockchain, and run as cloud-computing applications using ETH as the way you pay for computing cycles. They're cool.)\n\nNFT's 'wrap' other objects inside their smart contracts. So for example, if you buy a piece of digital art, the literal image could be wrapped in the token (the ones and zeros that make the GIF), or more likely, the token wraps a digital key that in turn unlocks a much higher resolution version. Since the token itself can be moved around and interacted with, there's a cost to both how complex and how big the tokens can be in practice.\n\nWhat you put into an NFT is entirely about trust. The NBA is wrapping up MP4s (or keys to them) in the body of their NFT. Other artists are putting keys to unlock music. I went to Rarible last night and minted 5 Non-Fungible Tokens of my own. I used their point-and-click tools and did no programming whatsoever.\n\nSince I have no real talent, I decided the thing I would sell was an item of external trust. If you buy one of these tokens, all you own is my promise. And my promise is minted on the token: you can transfer the token back to me (which I will then destroy or resell), in return for me giving you one hour of my life.\n\n(I am not expecting anyone to buy these. I'm making a bit of a point here: you can wrap anything in a smart contract, as long as you have a trust bridge. In this case the trust bridge is my word. If you think I'm unreliable, my promise is worthless. If you think I'm a person of my word, then the token is actually worth one of the projected 700,000 hours of my life. But feel free to buy it if you like!)\n\nThe process was relatively simple, but it wasn't free. In order to mint these 5 tokens, I had to pay 'Gas' to mint my contracts and make them available for people to buy. Gas is the computational currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Minting my tokens meant I sent a set of code out to the blockchain. When some miner minted a new ETH block, my work was done (and I paid him, in Gas). My cost for this was about $40 at current ETH prices and the load of the network last night. To participate in this weirdness, I had to join the Crypto Notional economy. I had to purchase a little bit of ETH (which I did at Coinbase). Because I need a 'hard' wallet -- a specific address on the blockchain that my new NFT's belong to and are minted by -- I had to move my ETH from Coinbase over to Metamask (one of many web-based hard wallets). I could also have used a wallet on my phone, or even resorted to writing a long string on paper somewhere.\n\nOnce I spent some cash at Coinbase to get into the crypto side of the house, everything that happens with this token happens only in the Crypto Notional economy. If you want to buy one of my tokens (guaranteed only one of 700,000 it would be possible to make!), you're going to owe me an ETH (the minimum Rarible lets you mint a token for, I'm not that much of a egotist). How much this is worth to you, as a buyer, will depend on at least two things: how much you value Ethereum, and how much you value an hour of my time. It would be easy to say \"well, the first is just an exchange rate,\" but since we both now need ETH to interact, (and it's easy to imagine all the internety-things ETH could be used for), ETH has utility beyond its simple conversion back and forth to USD. It is itself a useful good required to buy computing cycles from the cloud to implement smart contracts.\n\nOne really cool and still somewhat nascent feature of smart contracts is the idea of an Oracle. An Oracle is an external provider of data to a smart contract. So for example, if you have a contract that pays out on who wins a presidential election, you could assign a specific Oracle to have the contract consult to determine who won (Associated Press, etc). The beauty of such a system is that you can have information enter the smart contract without any human involvement and without creating a giant bloated mass of a smart contract which would cost far too much gas to run.\n\nPut another way, an Oracle to a Smart Contract is simply a way of accessing a piece of intellectual property that lives OFF OF the blockchain - the state of an external data set. So what if a PM or an Index provider, instead of running money, simply provided an oracle: an API that any (approved, secured) system could talk to which told the requestor in real time what a given portfolio looks like: 4% AAPL, 2% TSLA, etc. (This is essentially what CRSP does right now in their partnership with Symbiont and Vanguard, but to my understanding, that's effectively a closed network, in the same way FedWire is. They just use blockchain for fault tolerance and efficiency.)\n\nSo this part is pretty well trod: baking portfolio IP into a blockchain. What's the next step? Getting paid.\n\nWhen you buy an NFT, you're not just buying whatever IP got wrapped up in the contract, you're also getting access to a whole set of business logic coded into the NFT. In the dominant standard for digital art, ETC-721, a standard for paying royalties exists (and is part of my NadigHour tokens). If you decide to sell my token to Elon Musk for $1 million in a decade because I discovered the secret to time travel and it's a collectible (I won't, and it won't be), 10% of that transaction will get funneled back to the same ETH address I used to mint the coins. That's really cool for, say, an artist who's actually selling copyrights.\n\nBut back to indexing: coding up a smart contract to access an oracle that happens to return the constituents of an index or portfolio is pretty much trivial, but so what? If we stopped right here, what we have is a really interesting way of getting IP into direct indexing accounts. After all, this could just power all my fractional share trades at OSAM's Canvas or whatever Schwab launches this year. That's just a fun new way of sending a spreadsheet, often, with a lot of security and transaction history.\n\nBut what if a new kind of ETF (call it the CryptoETF) could access this information as a Portfolio Token? For example, Matt's Index issues a Portfolio Token to the Dave's Large-Cap CryptoETF (cDAVE). It's a singular NFT -- it exists to create the connection between Matt's Index and the CryptoETF, and its precise terms could be negotiated. Whenever the CryptoETF wants to adjust its portfolio (could be once a day, could be every second), they access the functions of the smart contract that is part of the Portfolio Token. As part of that access, the CryptoETF presents evidence of AUM, and remits payment (based on daily AUM over time, just like now, perhaps) to Matt's Index (in a tokenized store of value, like a stable coin) in return for that instance of access. Baking in the appropriate business logic here is absolutely trivial. The programming language used for smart contracts, Solidity, is ludicrously straightforward for anyone who has ever learned JavaScript (which at this point should cover every programmer born since 1970).\n\nWhat's even cooler is if to imagine a world where the Fund Company side of this transaction exists entirely in the Crypto Notional economy. What if the fund itself was simply a set of cryptographic assets. Instead of own individual stocks, say, they could own tokenized stocks. This is effectively what happens over at FTX (U.S. investors need not apply). FTX runs an exchange where you can trade token pairs (I give you an apple, you give me an orange). In order to make the apples say, bitcoin, and the oranges, say, Tesla Stock, they partnered with a brokerage to essentially create a giant public dark pool. Everyone opens up dual accounts with both FTX and their Security-Notional brokerage partner, CM-Equity, and FTX allows members of the dark pool to trade these token pairs with each other, which are then mimicked in the dark pool being run by CM-Equity (essentially). Each each token, in a way, represents a share in the dark pool run by the Securities Notional partner, assigned to a certain exposure (say, a share of TSLA). It's far to complex and fraught with single-counterparty risks (my opinion, feel free to yell at me), but I get why they ended up this way. Regulators are terrified, so you have to play ball with securities laws.\n\nA far more efficient way to bridge this gap between the Security-Notional ownership of $TSLA stock and the tokenized Crypto-Notional version of TSLA would be to simply establish bridged liquidity pools. This is the topic for an entire different discussion, but essentially, the Uniswap model for managing liquidity in any pair of assets is quite elegant, and there's really no reason (other than regulation) you couldn't apply it to any single asset class.\n\nVery briefly, each notional tradable pair (say, a stable coin like USDT vs. TSLA stock) would exist as its own pool of both (some USDT and some TSLA) to create an 'Exposure Token', which is what gets traded. When it gets out of balance, prices change to create arbitrage opportunities. This is how Uniswap handles a swap between, say, Ethereum and Bitcoin:\n\n(I get that I'm shorthanding an *enormous* amount here and I apologize, but I encourage ops nerds like me to dig in. It's super cool, and embeds all sorts of economics, like paying liqudiity providers for showing up beyond just providing an arbitrage opportunity).\n\nRight now, such a bridge token would likely violate a whole pile of securities laws in the U.S. -- which is exactly what we need to fix. But lets hand-wave that. If the fund company could, instead of going and buying a bunch of stocks on the Security-Notional side of things, instead simply go and buy a bunch of Exposure Tokens on the Crypto-Notional side of things, the implications are profound:\n- A 'CryptoETF' simply becomes a collection of tokens.\n- The CryptoETF itself, now just a collection of tokens tied to an external Portfolio Token which contains the IP, can implement business logic, and itself be tokenized.\n- The CryptoETF token presents methods for automatically accessing creation and redemption -- n ew CryptoETF tokens are created or burned based using baskets of the appropriate Exposure Tokens (tokenized TSLA, tokenized gold, whatever), which could of course change at any time based on new information from the Portfolio Token.\n- Any changes to the portfolio of any kind can be 100% automated -- because all you're doing is swapping Exposure Tokens for Exposure Tokens. If the fund needs to sell some Apple and buy some Tesla, the business logic of the CryptoETF can just automatically make the paired transactions back to a decentralized exchange like Uniswap.\n- Since the CryptoETF is itself tokenized, it can be transferred through Decentralized Exchanges, presented as collateral, or just stored somewhere, all without any direct involvement of the current global securities infrastructure (that's up to the liquidity providers).\n\nMy 'aha' moment here is that all of the above is so trivial, technically. The entirety of this could be coded into Ethereum-based tokens in a weekend (by someone else, I'm tired) using existing tech. It's also 100% impossible in the current regulatory environment. These Exposure Tokens could naturally be regulated entities with any counterparty risks or structural issues backstopped by our good friends at the DTCC. While that might make crypto-evangelists break out into hives, any bridging to the Security-Notional economy is going to require a counterparty to at the very least act as custodian for the Security-Notional side of the tokens, until we actually get rid of stocks and bonds altogether and just issue ownership rights directly to a blockchain.\n\nAll this is what i meant when I said last week that the United States has a real opportunity to lead here. Really thoughtful regulatory environments could turn the United States into the de facto global capitalist engine for the next 50 years. The path we're on is one of almost complete neglect. A little poking around the edges of central bank digital currencies doesn't cut it.\n\nSo what's the to-do list? Build standards. Build a regulatory framework supporting those standards. Implement. That's how this always works. The crypto community should be working hand in hand with regulators to make this future, not in conflict with, but in collaboration with the traditional Security-Notional economy. And doing so would put the U.S. back conducting the train of global capitalism, instead of hanging out in the caboose.\n\n--\n\nA Postscript on Bitcoin: I'm a well documented Bitcoin skeptic, as I am of all psychological commodities. I am however becoming slightly less of one because of a single realization: Bitcoin, more than anything, is collateral. It's a crypto-native asset that is widely held, traded, and valued. That's why folks like FTX and Binance treat Bitcoin as nearly-cash when it comes to posting collateral into a trading account on which to earn interest or gain margin, although even there, everything is marked at a USD amount. You can build an ecosystem to get away from fiat currencies, but it's gonna be a whole 'nother matter to get away from a peg. \n\nFinal Note: Ideas are ephemeral and implementation is everything. If you're already doing all this, please let me know. I'm sorry I missed you in my google search. If you think this is a cool idea and you go build some giant thing around it, feel free to put me on your board or buy one of my tokens (grin).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n-

dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn\u2019t get buy-in to his proposal.\n\nIf you want to find out more information about Ethereum or cryptocurrencies in general, then use the search box at the top of this page.

While NFTs have been around for years, they\u2019ve drawn increased attention in recent weeks after a number of incredibly lucrative sales.\n\nSource: Vladimir Kazakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNFTs are essentially smart contracts utilizing the blockchain to make sure specific conditions are met before processing a transaction. In practice, the primary use of that feature at this time is to validate transactions and record ownership of the NFT.\n\nThe \u201cnon-fungible\u201d part of the name refers to the fact that each NFT is totally unique. For example, two people may have purchased different NFTs for the same price, but those NFTs aren\u2019t necessarily interchangeable. One might be a GIF by a renowned illustrator, while the other may be an exclusive song by a musician. And their owners may not see their exchange as one to one the same way they would an exchange of say, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC) for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHistorically, NFTs have primarily been used for digital collectibles. You can think of them as online baseball cards, or similar to purchasing a piece of art.\n\nThose digital collectibles are a big part of why NFTs have been a hot news topic of late; last week, graphic designer David Rudnick sold an NFT for 10.8 ETH (approximately $18,600) on Zora, an NFT marketplace.\n\nThis particular NFT provides a valuable case study: Rudnick himself shared a copy of the digital art piece for free online. This is one area where NFTs truly begin to differ from visual art, which derive value from not only their aesthetic value or perceived growth potential, but also their actual scarcity.\n\nNFTs however, can become more valuable by virtue of being shared widely. Some liken this to buying a print of a painting, as opposed to owning it outright. Yes, I can put up a poster of the Mona Lisa in my home, but its not the real deal, even if it looks exactly the same. And by owning a poster of the Mona Lisa, I\u2019m adding to the perceived cultural value of the original work.\n\nDue to the blockchain nature of NFTs, creators can profit not only off the first point-of-sale, but also take a commission fee of subsequent resales, providing a distinct advantage for artists over traditional models. And it\u2019s not just visual artists engaged in the space.\n\nThe NBA has also gotten into the digital collectible game with its NBA Top Shot app. The app allows users to purchase certificates of ownership for game highlight videos, such as a particularly strong block by Zion Williamson.\n\nMeanwhile, in the music world, producers are releasing sample packs and exclusive music via NFTs.\n\nOne potentially lucrative future application of NFTs might be concert tickets. Given that NFTs are smart contracts, the blockchain could validate rules for tickets to set a ceiling on resale prices and how often a ticket can change ownership before the show.\n\nThere are also NFT applications in gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) to consider.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to say where NFTs go next, surging interest suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of the technology being more broadly adopted, similar to how increasing use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies led to their widespread acceptance today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin Rally Shows No Signs of Slowing Down, Despite Skepticism", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace via Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/aTiiw1BymRyBs35FB7nfpw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investorplace_417/a5da9b958d3206caa936b055b1271e81", "auther": "Faizan Farooque", "body": "Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is on a wild run of epic proportions, with no signs of stopping. Earlier in February, the digital currency\u2019s market value exceeded $1 trillion, according to Coindesk. Even now, several investors remain skeptical about putting their capital into the asset. However, the writing is on the wall.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInstitutional interest in Bitcoin is at an all-time high. Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), the nation\u2019s oldest bank, is paving the way for Bitcoin to use the networks usually reserved for conventional financial assets. Not so long ago, major custodian banks stayed away from the space due to regulatory or legal risks. However, client demand is forcing them to reevaluate their positions.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin according to a regulatory filing. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that Tesla has made approximately $1 billion in paper profits from the investment thus far.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnline payment processing companies PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ) have already allowed their users to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin. PayPal, in particular, is a real coup for Bitcoin. As of the end of 2020, it had total active accounts of 377 million.\n\nThe overarching theme is that the rally in Bitcoin prices is forcing the world\u2019s largest publicly traded financial services companies and major Wall Street giants to rethink their approach. That\u2019s why one shouldn\u2019t be skeptical of investing in the space at the moment. Bitcoin is finally going mainstream, and although there will be blips on the way, the trajectory is upward.\n\nChances are that if you read the news, the Bitcoin rally is something you are aware of. The cryptocurrency had a smashing 2020, rocketing to $20,000 from around $1,000. Due to the epic bull run, many investors compared the situation to the last time the digital currency went parabolic back in 2017.\n-  8 Risky Stocks to Buy If Danger Is Your Middle Name \n\nHowever, there are several key differences in the current run with the one we had back in 2017. Firstly, it may seem surprising, but the 2020-2021 run is less extreme than the last one. In that case, we saw a 20x return while the last year was roughly an 8x return.\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that in 2017 several projects kicked off as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), leading to massive runups for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), Ripple (CCC:XRP-USD), and their ilk. In fact, the other cryptos surpassed the Bitcoin rally and then some.\n\nCut to the current run, and it\u2019s the complete opposite. Bitcoin is leading the charge, with several cryptos rising in its shadow, rather than the other way around. CryptoCompare data shows the trading volumes for the digital currency on the eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk 20 have exceeded $11 billion, beating the 2017 all-time record.\n\nLastly, Bitcoin is going mainstream. Everyone wants to take advantage of the massive rally, and that\u2019s why you see massive financial institutions jump on the bandwagon as well. I\u2019ve gone through several major companies that have embraced digital currency, but I want to single out Mastercard\u2019s (NYSE:MA) recent announcement before moving to the next section. It has said that it will support \u201cselect cryptocurrencies\u201d on its network in the latter half of the year.\n\nAnother instance of corporate America warming up to Bitcoin.\n\nDespite the amazing bull run, there are still several skeptics out there. I would classify them into two categories. One set doesn\u2019t believe in the inherent story of Bitcoin, equating it to the tulip mania of 1637. The other group feels valuation is stretched at this point, and bubble bursting will make their investment worthless. We\u2019ve already addressed the concerns of the latter through this article. But the first set merits further discussion.\n\nEssentially, these are coming from the Warren Buffet school of investing. The Oracle of Omaha has steered clear of investing in Bitcoin and has laid out his reasons. Firstly, the billionaire investor only pours capital into areas that he understands.\n\nAdditionally, he has a firm \u201cbuy and hold\u201d strategy based on years of investing experience. He has held onto companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) because he believes in their story. These companies produce stable recurring cash flow based on their excellent business models. However, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have that. So, Buffet prefers to stay away.\n\nIf you are reading this and that strategy sounds a lot like how you invest, then it\u2019s tough work to convince you. However, if you have held this digital asset for a while, the ebbs and flows are not new.\n\nWhat keeps you interested in Bitcoin is the prospect of making 10 times on your investment. And there are no signs at the moment that stormy days are ahead for the cryptocurrency, which is finally getting a seat at the table in the investing world.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. \n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

That's quite literally the point of your broker. They sit between the Cash Economy and the Security-Notional economy and help you transact in the later. You allocate money from your cash into, say, an ETF. That ETF is nothing more than a slice of intellectual property (IP), whether they come from MSCI as part of an index, or from Cathie Wood's team at ARK Invest. That IP is then implemented through trades in underlying securities, through in kind creations or by taking cash from an Authorized Participant, and dozens of other fun but shockingly complex bits of work happen under the hood to keep the portfolio trued up (corporate actions, splits, M&A, securities lending, etc.) You can imagine it a bit like this:\n\nSo what are you really paying for? Well, sometimes the IP involved is expensive, and unique (like, say, the active management of ARKK). Sometimes it's relatively simple and loaded with competition (like, say, MSCI's large cap U.S. Index). You as an investor should expect to pay accordingly. You're also paying for all the other stuff, but that tends to be relatively inexpensive. If your ETF is in U.S. stocks, you'd expect it to be cheap, but if its emerging market local currency debt with hedging overlays? Well, you'd expect to pay a bit more.\n\nLet's tease this out and try to imagine the most efficient way this could work. The actual IP here is trivial to package up. It's just a continuous broadcast of portfolio state, a carnival barker yelling \"STEP RIGHT UP AND SEE TODAY'S S&P 500.\" In the world of modern data, there's little difference between publishing that daily in the Wall St. Journal and building an API that a computer could poke at on demand to get constituents. Even the most active manager does essentially the same thing: they just say what the contents of the IP are, all the time.\n\nIn order to get paid for that IP, we've created all sorts of systems. Most involve you literally giving the money to the IP holder, and letting them handle the rest. If you want access to ARK, you can buy a mutual fund or an ETF, or if you're big enough, open up an SMA. But regardless, you move money across the notional barrier from your pile of cash into some Security-Notional vehicle, which ARK then manages. But what you're really looking for is the IP. Index providers get paid a little differently - they license their intellectual property to pretty much anyone, but the real money is in licensing it to fund managers who package it up into ETFs and funds of their own. They also license their IP to media, researchers, data providers, and so on.\n\nThe implementation part turns out to be relatively annoying. So much so that we've created all sorts of products to avoid it: index futures in particular were created to avoid the friction of implementation (among other things). So were 'synthetic ETFs' in Europe or Exchange-Traded Notes here in the U.S., and of course a huge chunk of the derivatives markets from swaps to structured notes. The IP is what matters. The implementation is just friction.\n\nThe New Hotness, in case you missed it, is 'Non-Fungible Tokens' or NFTs. The idea of an NFT is pretty simple: it's simply a digital blob that can't be duplicated, and it is one of a kind. This is distinct from Bitcoin, which are digital blobs of which there are currently 18 million. Yours is exactly as useful as mine. With an NFT, you make a one and done for each token. You can 'burn' it, but you can't change it, and it's unique. This the idea behind the widely popularized NBA TopShot digital collectible ... THINGS.\n\nA Sidebar for Nerds: I am hung up on digital objects having utility, and I'm trying to get past it. I have opened countless 'digital packs' of 'digital cards' that I paid real money for to play a game called Magic: The Gathering. Those fake things had real utility to me, because I enjoy playing a game that I can only play if I have those cards. I have absolutely no emotional attachment to my ownership of them. At the very same time, I don't, at my core, understand or appreciate the value of a piece of digital artwork which I could see in my browser right now for free, just because you tell me mine's 'official'. Give me copyright and let me put it on my business cards or sell it to Getty Images? Sure. But just to know I own one of 100 \"real\" copies that is now mine? Nope. I am 100% aware of the ridiculous double standard here, and I am not suggesting I'm correct. I'm saying it's where I'm at right now.\n\nEach card in a TopShot pack, or each piece of digital artwork on Rarible, OpenSea, or a dozen other platforms, is usually just a Smart Contract tied to the Ethereum network. (I wrote a bit about smart contracts last week, but in short, they take a bunch of business logic, embed it in a piece of publicly accessible code in the Ethereum blockchain, and run as cloud-computing applications using ETH as the way you pay for computing cycles. They're cool.)\n\nNFT's 'wrap' other objects inside their smart contracts. So for example, if you buy a piece of digital art, the literal image could be wrapped in the token (the ones and zeros that make the GIF), or more likely, the token wraps a digital key that in turn unlocks a much higher resolution version. Since the token itself can be moved around and interacted with, there's a cost to both how complex and how big the tokens can be in practice.\n\nWhat you put into an NFT is entirely about trust. The NBA is wrapping up MP4s (or keys to them) in the body of their NFT. Other artists are putting keys to unlock music. I went to Rarible last night and minted 5 Non-Fungible Tokens of my own. I used their point-and-click tools and did no programming whatsoever.\n\nSince I have no real talent, I decided the thing I would sell was an item of external trust. If you buy one of these tokens, all you own is my promise. And my promise is minted on the token: you can transfer the token back to me (which I will then destroy or resell), in return for me giving you one hour of my life.\n\n(I am not expecting anyone to buy these. I'm making a bit of a point here: you can wrap anything in a smart contract, as long as you have a trust bridge. In this case the trust bridge is my word. If you think I'm unreliable, my promise is worthless. If you think I'm a person of my word, then the token is actually worth one of the projected 700,000 hours of my life. But feel free to buy it if you like!)\n\nThe process was relatively simple, but it wasn't free. In order to mint these 5 tokens, I had to pay 'Gas' to mint my contracts and make them available for people to buy. Gas is the computational currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Minting my tokens meant I sent a set of code out to the blockchain. When some miner minted a new ETH block, my work was done (and I paid him, in Gas). My cost for this was about $40 at current ETH prices and the load of the network last night. To participate in this weirdness, I had to join the Crypto Notional economy. I had to purchase a little bit of ETH (which I did at Coinbase). Because I need a 'hard' wallet -- a specific address on the blockchain that my new NFT's belong to and are minted by -- I had to move my ETH from Coinbase over to Metamask (one of many web-based hard wallets). I could also have used a wallet on my phone, or even resorted to writing a long string on paper somewhere.\n\nOnce I spent some cash at Coinbase to get into the crypto side of the house, everything that happens with this token happens only in the Crypto Notional economy. If you want to buy one of my tokens (guaranteed only one of 700,000 it would be possible to make!), you're going to owe me an ETH (the minimum Rarible lets you mint a token for, I'm not that much of a egotist). How much this is worth to you, as a buyer, will depend on at least two things: how much you value Ethereum, and how much you value an hour of my time. It would be easy to say \"well, the first is just an exchange rate,\" but since we both now need ETH to interact, (and it's easy to imagine all the internety-things ETH could be used for), ETH has utility beyond its simple conversion back and forth to USD. It is itself a useful good required to buy computing cycles from the cloud to implement smart contracts.\n\nOne really cool and still somewhat nascent feature of smart contracts is the idea of an Oracle. An Oracle is an external provider of data to a smart contract. So for example, if you have a contract that pays out on who wins a presidential election, you could assign a specific Oracle to have the contract consult to determine who won (Associated Press, etc). The beauty of such a system is that you can have information enter the smart contract without any human involvement and without creating a giant bloated mass of a smart contract which would cost far too much gas to run.\n\nPut another way, an Oracle to a Smart Contract is simply a way of accessing a piece of intellectual property that lives OFF OF the blockchain - the state of an external data set. So what if a PM or an Index provider, instead of running money, simply provided an oracle: an API that any (approved, secured) system could talk to which told the requestor in real time what a given portfolio looks like: 4% AAPL, 2% TSLA, etc. (This is essentially what CRSP does right now in their partnership with Symbiont and Vanguard, but to my understanding, that's effectively a closed network, in the same way FedWire is. They just use blockchain for fault tolerance and efficiency.)\n\nSo this part is pretty well trod: baking portfolio IP into a blockchain. What's the next step? Getting paid.\n\nWhen you buy an NFT, you're not just buying whatever IP got wrapped up in the contract, you're also getting access to a whole set of business logic coded into the NFT. In the dominant standard for digital art, ETC-721, a standard for paying royalties exists (and is part of my NadigHour tokens). If you decide to sell my token to Elon Musk for $1 million in a decade because I discovered the secret to time travel and it's a collectible (I won't, and it won't be), 10% of that transaction will get funneled back to the same ETH address I used to mint the coins. That's really cool for, say, an artist who's actually selling copyrights.\n\nBut back to indexing: coding up a smart contract to access an oracle that happens to return the constituents of an index or portfolio is pretty much trivial, but so what? If we stopped right here, what we have is a really interesting way of getting IP into direct indexing accounts. After all, this could just power all my fractional share trades at OSAM's Canvas or whatever Schwab launches this year. That's just a fun new way of sending a spreadsheet, often, with a lot of security and transaction history.\n\nBut what if a new kind of ETF (call it the CryptoETF) could access this information as a Portfolio Token? For example, Matt's Index issues a Portfolio Token to the Dave's Large-Cap CryptoETF (cDAVE). It's a singular NFT -- it exists to create the connection between Matt's Index and the CryptoETF, and its precise terms could be negotiated. Whenever the CryptoETF wants to adjust its portfolio (could be once a day, could be every second), they access the functions of the smart contract that is part of the Portfolio Token. As part of that access, the CryptoETF presents evidence of AUM, and remits payment (based on daily AUM over time, just like now, perhaps) to Matt's Index (in a tokenized store of value, like a stable coin) in return for that instance of access. Baking in the appropriate business logic here is absolutely trivial. The programming language used for smart contracts, Solidity, is ludicrously straightforward for anyone who has ever learned JavaScript (which at this point should cover every programmer born since 1970).\n\nWhat's even cooler is if to imagine a world where the Fund Company side of this transaction exists entirely in the Crypto Notional economy. What if the fund itself was simply a set of cryptographic assets. Instead of own individual stocks, say, they could own tokenized stocks. This is effectively what happens over at FTX (U.S. investors need not apply). FTX runs an exchange where you can trade token pairs (I give you an apple, you give me an orange). In order to make the apples say, bitcoin, and the oranges, say, Tesla Stock, they partnered with a brokerage to essentially create a giant public dark pool. Everyone opens up dual accounts with both FTX and their Security-Notional brokerage partner, CM-Equity, and FTX allows members of the dark pool to trade these token pairs with each other, which are then mimicked in the dark pool being run by CM-Equity (essentially). Each each token, in a way, represents a share in the dark pool run by the Securities Notional partner, assigned to a certain exposure (say, a share of TSLA). It's far to complex and fraught with single-counterparty risks (my opinion, feel free to yell at me), but I get why they ended up this way. Regulators are terrified, so you have to play ball with securities laws.\n\nA far more efficient way to bridge this gap between the Security-Notional ownership of $TSLA stock and the tokenized Crypto-Notional version of TSLA would be to simply establish bridged liquidity pools. This is the topic for an entire different discussion, but essentially, the Uniswap model for managing liquidity in any pair of assets is quite elegant, and there's really no reason (other than regulation) you couldn't apply it to any single asset class.\n\nVery briefly, each notional tradable pair (say, a stable coin like USDT vs. TSLA stock) would exist as its own pool of both (some USDT and some TSLA) to create an 'Exposure Token', which is what gets traded. When it gets out of balance, prices change to create arbitrage opportunities. This is how Uniswap handles a swap between, say, Ethereum and Bitcoin:\n\n(I get that I'm shorthanding an *enormous* amount here and I apologize, but I encourage ops nerds like me to dig in. It's super cool, and embeds all sorts of economics, like paying liqudiity providers for showing up beyond just providing an arbitrage opportunity).\n\nRight now, such a bridge token would likely violate a whole pile of securities laws in the U.S. -- which is exactly what we need to fix. But lets hand-wave that. If the fund company could, instead of going and buying a bunch of stocks on the Security-Notional side of things, instead simply go and buy a bunch of Exposure Tokens on the Crypto-Notional side of things, the implications are profound:\n- A 'CryptoETF' simply becomes a collection of tokens.\n- The CryptoETF itself, now just a collection of tokens tied to an external Portfolio Token which contains the IP, can implement business logic, and itself be tokenized.\n- The CryptoETF token presents methods for automatically accessing creation and redemption -- n ew CryptoETF tokens are created or burned based using baskets of the appropriate Exposure Tokens (tokenized TSLA, tokenized gold, whatever), which could of course change at any time based on new information from the Portfolio Token.\n- Any changes to the portfolio of any kind can be 100% automated -- because all you're doing is swapping Exposure Tokens for Exposure Tokens. If the fund needs to sell some Apple and buy some Tesla, the business logic of the CryptoETF can just automatically make the paired transactions back to a decentralized exchange like Uniswap.\n- Since the CryptoETF is itself tokenized, it can be transferred through Decentralized Exchanges, presented as collateral, or just stored somewhere, all without any direct involvement of the current global securities infrastructure (that's up to the liquidity providers).\n\nMy 'aha' moment here is that all of the above is so trivial, technically. The entirety of this could be coded into Ethereum-based tokens in a weekend (by someone else, I'm tired) using existing tech. It's also 100% impossible in the current regulatory environment. These Exposure Tokens could naturally be regulated entities with any counterparty risks or structural issues backstopped by our good friends at the DTCC. While that might make crypto-evangelists break out into hives, any bridging to the Security-Notional economy is going to require a counterparty to at the very least act as custodian for the Security-Notional side of the tokens, until we actually get rid of stocks and bonds altogether and just issue ownership rights directly to a blockchain.\n\nAll this is what i meant when I said last week that the United States has a real opportunity to lead here. Really thoughtful regulatory environments could turn the United States into the de facto global capitalist engine for the next 50 years. The path we're on is one of almost complete neglect. A little poking around the edges of central bank digital currencies doesn't cut it.\n\nSo what's the to-do list? Build standards. Build a regulatory framework supporting those standards. Implement. That's how this always works. The crypto community should be working hand in hand with regulators to make this future, not in conflict with, but in collaboration with the traditional Security-Notional economy. And doing so would put the U.S. back conducting the train of global capitalism, instead of hanging out in the caboose.\n\n--\n\nA Postscript on Bitcoin: I'm a well documented Bitcoin skeptic, as I am of all psychological commodities. I am however becoming slightly less of one because of a single realization: Bitcoin, more than anything, is collateral. It's a crypto-native asset that is widely held, traded, and valued. That's why folks like FTX and Binance treat Bitcoin as nearly-cash when it comes to posting collateral into a trading account on which to earn interest or gain margin, although even there, everything is marked at a USD amount. You can build an ecosystem to get away from fiat currencies, but it's gonna be a whole 'nother matter to get away from a peg. \n\nFinal Note: Ideas are ephemeral and implementation is everything. If you're already doing all this, please let me know. I'm sorry I missed you in my google search. If you think this is a cool idea and you go build some giant thing around it, feel free to put me on your board or buy one of my tokens (grin).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n- SPY ETF Quote\n- VOO ETF Quote\n- QQQ ETF Quote\n- VTI ETF Quote\n- JNUG ETF Quote\n- Top 34 Gold ETFs \n- Top 34 Oil ETFs \n- Top 57 Financials ETFs \n- Yellen Puts the Damper on Bitcoin Viability Amid a Volatile Surge\n- 16 Ways to Withdraw Money From Your 401k Without Penalty\n- Crude ETFs Climbing Again Amid Talk of a Commodities Supercycle\n- Throw Out The Playbook: How to Build A Crypto ETF\n- Stock ETFs Continue to Decline Amid Rising Bond Yields\n\nREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >\n"}]}]
