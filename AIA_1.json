cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen said bitcoin was \"inefficient\" as a means of payment and highly speculative.\n\nAnalysts also pointed to tweet from Elon Musk over the weekend saying bitcoin and ethereum prices \"seem high.\"\n\n\"Tesla and bitcoin are increasingly tied together and the latter had a crazy day, trading down -16.53% at one point before closing -4.21% in its worst daily performance this month,\" said Jim Reid, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"It\u2019s not clear if the moves were prompted by a delayed reaction to an Elon Musk tweet on Saturday in which he said that the bitcoin did 'seem high'.\"\n\nThe slump follows a surge over the last few months that has propelled the market to new highs. Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Tesla scores about $1 billion in profits from Bitcoin: Wedbush's Dan Ives", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/DRFv6hd8jl8ukNhrQl4EXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1790a240-37e3-11ea-bd6c-b09fddc3cadb", "auther": "Ines Ferr\u00e9", "body": "Tesla's (TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the electric vehicle company about $1 billion in profits \u2014 at least on paper, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives.\n\n\"That\u2019s more than all they made on EV vehicles in 2020, but that continues to be the double-edge sword. It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

He made his prediction shortly after holding a virtual conference with about 1,000 business leaders and just before his company filed to raise more than $500 million to purchase more bitcoin. Saylor was quick to take to Twitter to celebrate Jack Dorsey leading Square to double down on bitcoin in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nSquare announced today that it has purchased ~3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million.

It has gained almost 20% this week.\n\nIn December it soared past Visa (V) to make it the world\u2019s largest financial service.\n\nBitcoin has been fuelled of late by acceptance from mainstream investors and companies, such as Tesla (TSLA) and Mastercard (MA).\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla invested $1.5bn in the cryptocurrency, and said it may even start accepting it as payment for its products.\n\nIn a filing with the SEC, Tesla said it has \u201cinvested an aggregate $1.5bn in bitcoin,\u201d and \u201cmay acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term.\u201d\n\nIt added that it expects to \u201cbegin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for [its] products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which [it] may or may not liquidate upon receipt.\u201d\n\nIts popularity has also been boosted by Tesla\u2019s founder Elon Musk, who has often been seen tweeting about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe publicly declared on Thursday that he favours it to fiat currency as global interest rates are currently at record lows, saying Bitcoin is a \u201cless dumb form of liquidity than cash.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be clear, I am not an investor, I am an engineer,\u201d he said on Twitter. \"I don\u2019t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHowever, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn\u2019t look elsewhere. Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is 'almost'.\n\nMusk also defended Tesla\u2019s move to invest by saying Bitcoin is \u201cadventurous enough for an S&P 500 company.\u201d\n\nWatch: What is Bitcoin?\n\nLast night he changed his Twitter profile picture to Bitcoin \u201cjust for the day,\u201d tweeting \u201cI just want to start a flame in your heart.\u201d\n\nBitcoin started 2020 at around $7,000 per coin. Despite its rise in the last year, the cryptocurrency remains extremely volatile and experts continue to remain sceptical about using it as an investment.\n\nHowever, a survey published last week showed almost two-thirds of UK investors intend to buy bitcoin in 2021 and well over half expect its value to increase to $60,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD), the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, also hit a record overnight, touching over $2,000 for the first time in its history.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of dogecoin (DOGE-USD) has also surged in recent weeks after Musk began tweeting about it. The rise has coincided with a surge of populism in financial markets around the world.\n\nDogecoin hit a new all-time high this month, as celebrity attention including rapper Snoop Dogg continued to buoy up the price of the joke token.\n\nREAD MORE: Dogecoin hits new high after Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg tweets\n\nThe digital currency, which uses a Shiba Inu dog as its mascot, first started up as a joke in 2013 but has seen its market capitalisation pass $6bn.\n\nMusk first tweeted just the word \u201cDoge,\u201d followed by \u201cDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto,\u201d and \u201cNo highs, no lows, only Doge.\u201d He also posted a Lion King meme of him holding up the dogecoin dog as if it were Simba.\n\nHe said at the time: \"They are really just meant to be jokes, but you know Dogecoin was made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies obviously, but fate loves irony and often as a friend of mine says that the most ironic outcome or I'd say the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of earth in the future.\u201d\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n"}, {"headline": "4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: BA, DE, Litecoin, RCL", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/I_GHyyLeQaHlxgIMX3eotg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investorplace_417/13522e8441308910763ccbb76de3f676", "auther": "Bret Kenwell", "body": "It was an up-and-down session that\u2019s now mostly flat for the S&P 500.

Since then, we\u2019ve had back-to-back tight-ranged weeks.\n\nOn the plus side, earnings are out of the way and Boeing continues to hold over the 10-week moving average. Moving nicely on Friday, bulls will be looking for Boeing to give us a two-times weekly-up rotation by clearing the highs from the prior two weeks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf it can do that, as well as hurdle the 50% retracement, the $234 level could be in play, followed by the December high near $244. Above that puts the 61.8% retracement on the table near $250.\n-  7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don\u2019t Get Tired Of \n\nOn the downside, a break of the 10-week moving average puts the 21-week moving average on deck, followed by the $188 to $190 area.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nMan, what else can we say about Deere (NYSE:DE) at this point? The stock looks like a high-flying tech holding more than an industrial/agriculture company. That said, it does have some tech components to the business model.\n\nRegardless, this stock has been moving straight up for months now. Each dip to the 10-week moving average \u2014 including this week \u2014 has been bought aggressively by the bulls.\n\nThe institutional support is robust with this one, which would have me crossing it off my \u201cshort list\u201d in a hurry. Now at the three-times range extension and new record highs though, and I\u2019m in no hurry to chase this one either.\n\nAbove $335, and a run to $350 is possible, then $380. A break of the 10-week moving average will eventually happen, putting the 21-week moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nTuesday was Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). Wednesday was Bitcoin Cash (CCC:BCH-USD). Thursday was Etherium (CCC:ETH-USD). Now let\u2019s look at Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) as we wrap up the crypto week and as bitcoin hits a $1 trillion market capitalization today.\n\nLitecoin had a pretty rough correction from its 2019 high at $146.95 down to its 2020 low at $24.85. However, it\u2019s been on fire over the last few months.\n\nShares ripped up through the prior 2019 high, then consolidated its gains by finding support at the 10-week moving average. Once that consolidation ended though, it was off to the races again.\n\nNow pushing through the 161.8% extension, let\u2019s see if Litecoin can push up to $250, then $269.50, as the two-times range extension comes into play near the latter.\n-  7 Stocks Riding the Crypto Craze \n\nOn the downside, I would love to see the 161.8% extension act as support, as well as $200.

Up almost 17% this week, shares are rallying into earnings scheduled for Monday.\n\nThis one has been on fire, reclaiming its 10-day, 21-day, 50-day and 100-day moving averages amid the four-day rally. It doesn\u2019t look like much after such a wide trading range over the last year, but it\u2019s a nice run. Ahead of earnings does make it a little tricky, though.\n\nOver the 50% retracement and its short-term moving averages puts the bulls in control for the moment. On a bullish earnings reaction, let\u2019s see if shares can clear the recent high near $85. Above puts the 61.8% retracement in play, then the $100 mark.\n\nOn a bearish reaction, see if RCL stock holds the 100-day moving average \u2014 the lowest of the four listed above.

cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen said bitcoin was \"inefficient\" as a means of payment and highly speculative.\n\nAnalysts also pointed to tweet from Elon Musk over the weekend saying bitcoin and ethereum prices \"seem high.\"\n\n\"Tesla and bitcoin are increasingly tied together and the latter had a crazy day, trading down -16.53% at one point before closing -4.21% in its worst daily performance this month,\" said Jim Reid, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"It\u2019s not clear if the moves were prompted by a delayed reaction to an Elon Musk tweet on Saturday in which he said that the bitcoin did 'seem high'.\"\n\nThe slump follows a surge over the last few months that has propelled the market to new highs. Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Tesla scores about $1 billion in profits from Bitcoin: Wedbush's Dan Ives", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/DRFv6hd8jl8ukNhrQl4EXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1790a240-37e3-11ea-bd6c-b09fddc3cadb", "auther": "Ines Ferr\u00e9", "body": "Tesla's (TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the electric vehicle company about $1 billion in profits \u2014 at least on paper, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives.\n\n\"That\u2019s more than all they made on EV vehicles in 2020, but that continues to be the double-edge sword. It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

He made his prediction shortly after holding a virtual conference with about 1,000 business leaders and just before his company filed to raise more than $500 million to purchase more bitcoin. Saylor was quick to take to Twitter to celebrate Jack Dorsey leading Square to double down on bitcoin in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nSquare announced today that it has purchased ~3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million.

The key word is 'almost'.\n\nMusk also defended Tesla\u2019s move to invest by saying Bitcoin is \u201cadventurous enough for an S&P 500 company.\u201d\n\nWatch: What is Bitcoin?\n\nLast night he changed his Twitter profile picture to Bitcoin \u201cjust for the day,\u201d tweeting \u201cI just want to start a flame in your heart.\u201d\n\nBitcoin started 2020 at around $7,000 per coin. Despite its rise in the last year, the cryptocurrency remains extremely volatile and experts continue to remain sceptical about using it as an investment.\n\nHowever, a survey published last week showed almost two-thirds of UK investors intend to buy bitcoin in 2021 and well over half expect its value to increase to $60,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD), the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, also hit a record overnight, touching over $2,000 for the first time in its history.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of dogecoin (DOGE-USD) has also surged in recent weeks after Musk began tweeting about it. The rise has coincided with a surge of populism in financial markets around the world.\n\nDogecoin hit a new all-time high this month, as celebrity attention including rapper Snoop Dogg continued to buoy up the price of the joke token.\n\nREAD MORE: Dogecoin hits new high after Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg tweets\n\nThe digital currency, which uses a Shiba Inu dog as its mascot, first started up as a joke in 2013 but has seen its market capitalisation pass $6bn.\n\nMusk first tweeted just the word \u201cDoge,\u201d followed by \u201cDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto,\u201d and \u201cNo highs, no lows, only Doge.\u201d He also posted a Lion King meme of him holding up the dogecoin dog as if it were Simba.\n\nHe said at the time: \"They are really just meant to be jokes, but you know Dogecoin was made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies obviously, but fate loves irony and often as a friend of mine says that the most ironic outcome or I'd say the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of earth in the future.\u201d\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n"}, {"headline": "4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: BA, DE, Litecoin, RCL", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/I_GHyyLeQaHlxgIMX3eotg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investorplace_417/13522e8441308910763ccbb76de3f676", "auther": "Bret Kenwell", "body": "It was an up-and-down session that\u2019s now mostly flat for the S&P 500.

Since then, we\u2019ve had back-to-back tight-ranged weeks.\n\nOn the plus side, earnings are out of the way and Boeing continues to hold over the 10-week moving average. Moving nicely on Friday, bulls will be looking for Boeing to give us a two-times weekly-up rotation by clearing the highs from the prior two weeks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf it can do that, as well as hurdle the 50% retracement, the $234 level could be in play, followed by the December high near $244. Above that puts the 61.8% retracement on the table near $250.\n-  7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don\u2019t Get Tired Of \n\nOn the downside, a break of the 10-week moving average puts the 21-week moving average on deck, followed by the $188 to $190 area.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nMan, what else can we say about Deere (NYSE:DE) at this point? The stock looks like a high-flying tech holding more than an industrial/agriculture company. That said, it does have some tech components to the business model.\n\nRegardless, this stock has been moving straight up for months now. Each dip to the 10-week moving average \u2014 including this week \u2014 has been bought aggressively by the bulls.\n\nThe institutional support is robust with this one, which would have me crossing it off my \u201cshort list\u201d in a hurry.

A break of the 10-week moving average will eventually happen, putting the 21-week moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nTuesday was Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). Wednesday was Bitcoin Cash (CCC:BCH-USD). Thursday was Etherium (CCC:ETH-USD). Now let\u2019s look at Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) as we wrap up the crypto week and as bitcoin hits a $1 trillion market capitalization today.\n\nLitecoin had a pretty rough correction from its 2019 high at $146.95 down to its 2020 low at $24.85. However, it\u2019s been on fire over the last few months.\n\nShares ripped up through the prior 2019 high, then consolidated its gains by finding support at the 10-week moving average. Once that consolidation ended though, it was off to the races again.\n\nNow pushing through the 161.8% extension, let\u2019s see if Litecoin can push up to $250, then $269.50, as the two-times range extension comes into play near the latter.\n-  7 Stocks Riding the Crypto Craze \n\nOn the downside, I would love to see the 161.8% extension act as support, as well as $200.

Up almost 17% this week, shares are rallying into earnings scheduled for Monday.\n\nThis one has been on fire, reclaiming its 10-day, 21-day, 50-day and 100-day moving averages amid the four-day rally. It doesn\u2019t look like much after such a wide trading range over the last year, but it\u2019s a nice run. Ahead of earnings does make it a little tricky, though.\n\nOver the 50% retracement and its short-term moving averages puts the bulls in control for the moment. On a bullish earnings reaction, let\u2019s see if shares can clear the recent high near $85. Above puts the 61.8% retracement in play, then the $100 mark.\n\nOn a bearish reaction, see if RCL stock holds the 100-day moving average \u2014 the lowest of the four listed above.

cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen said bitcoin was \"inefficient\" as a means of payment and highly speculative.\n\nAnalysts also pointed to tweet from Elon Musk over the weekend saying bitcoin and ethereum prices \"seem high.\"\n\n\"Tesla and bitcoin are increasingly tied together and the latter had a crazy day, trading down -16.53% at one point before closing -4.21% in its worst daily performance this month,\" said Jim Reid, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"It\u2019s not clear if the moves were prompted by a delayed reaction to an Elon Musk tweet on Saturday in which he said that the bitcoin did 'seem high'.\"\n\nThe slump follows a surge over the last few months that has propelled the market to new highs. Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Tesla scores about $1 billion in profits from Bitcoin: Wedbush's Dan Ives", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/DRFv6hd8jl8ukNhrQl4EXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1790a240-37e3-11ea-bd6c-b09fddc3cadb", "auther": "Ines Ferr\u00e9", "body": "Tesla's (TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the electric vehicle company about $1 billion in profits \u2014 at least on paper, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives.\n\n\"That\u2019s more than all they made on EV vehicles in 2020, but that continues to be the double-edge sword. It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices. Over the weekend \u2014 responding to a tweet - Musk indicated Bitcoin and Etherium (ETH-USD) could be high. That sent Bitcoin well below $50,000, thought it jumped back around $53,000 during Monday's session.\n\nThat said, BTC & ETH do seem high lol\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 20, 2021\n\nShares of Tesla on Monday were down more than 4% as they have recently broken some key support levels. The stock was sitting around $870 in early February. It touched an intraday high of $900.40 on January 25th.\n\n\"I think we\u2019re just in the early innings of the EV story playing out.

He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

He made his prediction shortly after holding a virtual conference with about 1,000 business leaders and just before his company filed to raise more than $500 million to purchase more bitcoin. Saylor was quick to take to Twitter to celebrate Jack Dorsey leading Square to double down on bitcoin in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nSquare announced today that it has purchased ~3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million.

The number flipped positive on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cCoinbase [U.S. dollar] whales are like gatekeepers\u201d of the bull market, Ki said of investors with large holdings.\n\nEther (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $1,828.15 and climbing 4.45% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).\n\nOn the technical side, ether is in a consolidation phase after losing short-term momentum, according to Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies.\n\n\u201cI view the consolidation as healthy within the context of its steep uptrend,\u201d Stockton said. \u201cThe 20-day moving average at $1,556 is a gauge of initial support.\u201d\n\nRead more: Coinbase, Readying for Public Listing, Gets $77B Valuation From Nasdaq Private Market\n\nEther\u2019s correlation with bitcoin has been flat this month at around 0.68, after it moved down to as low as 0.55 in January.\n\n\u201cAs long as bitcoin stays above $49,000 we can expect a rally in the altcoins, including ether,\u201d OKEx Insights\u2019 Naseer said. \u201cBut that will only happen when bitcoin\u2019s volatility drops a little.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, institutional interest in ether futures has grown significantly, according to data provided by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\n\u201cOne week after ether futures launched on CME, daily trading volume reached a total of $75.8 million yesterday \u2013 almost doubling Friday\u2019s volume of $40 million,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a tweet Wednesday. \u201cMeanwhile, open interest has increased to $62 million.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the CME\u2019s new ether futures contract last week might be one reason why ether\u2019s price has underperformed, said trader and analyst Alex Kruger.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Favorite Lossless Lottery Will Airdrop Its POOL Token Today\n\n\u201cEther is a high beta asset to bitcoin, and it is supposed to move in line,\u201d Kruger said. \u201cSometimes its own set of technical and or fundamental drivers kick in and make price trajectories or performance differences.\u201d\n\nDigital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in green Wednesday.

It has gained almost 20% this week.\n\nIn December it soared past Visa (V) to make it the world\u2019s largest financial service.\n\nBitcoin has been fuelled of late by acceptance from mainstream investors and companies, such as Tesla (TSLA) and Mastercard (MA).\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla invested $1.5bn in the cryptocurrency, and said it may even start accepting it as payment for its products.\n\nIn a filing with the SEC, Tesla said it has \u201cinvested an aggregate $1.5bn in bitcoin,\u201d and \u201cmay acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term.\u201d\n\nIt added that it expects to \u201cbegin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for [its] products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which [it] may or may not liquidate upon receipt.\u201d\n\nIts popularity has also been boosted by Tesla\u2019s founder Elon Musk, who has often been seen tweeting about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe publicly declared on Thursday that he favours it to fiat currency as global interest rates are currently at record lows, saying Bitcoin is a \u201cless dumb form of liquidity than cash.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be clear, I am not an investor, I am an engineer,\u201d he said on Twitter. \"I don\u2019t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHowever, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn\u2019t look elsewhere.

Despite its rise in the last year, the cryptocurrency remains extremely volatile and experts continue to remain sceptical about using it as an investment.\n\nHowever, a survey published last week showed almost two-thirds of UK investors intend to buy bitcoin in 2021 and well over half expect its value to increase to $60,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD), the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, also hit a record overnight, touching over $2,000 for the first time in its history.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of dogecoin (DOGE-USD) has also surged in recent weeks after Musk began tweeting about it. The rise has coincided with a surge of populism in financial markets around the world.\n\nDogecoin hit a new all-time high this month, as celebrity attention including rapper Snoop Dogg continued to buoy up the price of the joke token.\n\nREAD MORE: Dogecoin hits new high after Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg tweets\n\nThe digital currency, which uses a Shiba Inu dog as its mascot, first started up as a joke in 2013 but has seen its market capitalisation pass $6bn.\n\nMusk first tweeted just the word \u201cDoge,\u201d followed by \u201cDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto,\u201d and \u201cNo highs, no lows, only Doge.\u201d He also posted a Lion King meme of him holding up the dogecoin dog as if it were Simba.\n\nHe said at the time: \"They are really just meant to be jokes, but you know Dogecoin was made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies obviously, but fate loves irony and often as a friend of mine says that the most ironic outcome or I'd say the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of earth in the future.\u201d\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n"}, {"headline": "4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: BA, DE, Litecoin, RCL", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/I_GHyyLeQaHlxgIMX3eotg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investorplace_417/13522e8441308910763ccbb76de3f676", "auther": "Bret Kenwell", "body": "It was an up-and-down session that\u2019s now mostly flat for the S&P 500.

cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen said bitcoin was \"inefficient\" as a means of payment and highly speculative.\n\nAnalysts also pointed to tweet from Elon Musk over the weekend saying bitcoin and ethereum prices \"seem high.\"\n\n\"Tesla and bitcoin are increasingly tied together and the latter had a crazy day, trading down -16.53% at one point before closing -4.21% in its worst daily performance this month,\" said Jim Reid, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"It\u2019s not clear if the moves were prompted by a delayed reaction to an Elon Musk tweet on Saturday in which he said that the bitcoin did 'seem high'.\"\n\nThe slump follows a surge over the last few months that has propelled the market to new highs. Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Tesla scores about $1 billion in profits from Bitcoin: Wedbush's Dan Ives", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/DRFv6hd8jl8ukNhrQl4EXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1790a240-37e3-11ea-bd6c-b09fddc3cadb", "auther": "Ines Ferr\u00e9", "body": "Tesla's (TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the electric vehicle company about $1 billion in profits \u2014 at least on paper, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives.\n\n\"That\u2019s more than all they made on EV vehicles in 2020, but that continues to be the double-edge sword.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

Averaging out the 3,318 bitcoins Square says it purchased would indicate an average price of about $51,235 per bitcoin (BTC-USD). The cryptocurrency had dipped below $48,000 on Tuesday at the time of Square\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cAligned with the company\u2019s purpose, Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment, providing a way for individuals to participate in a global monetary system and secure their own financial future,\u201d the company wrote in a press release ahead of its earnings call. \u201cThe investment is part of Square\u2019s ongoing commitment to bitcoin, and the company plans to assess its aggregate investment in bitcoin relative to its other investments on an ongoing basis.\u201d\n\nSquare had earlier purchased about $50 million in bitcoin in October 2020. At the time, the purchase amounted to about 1% of the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFor comparison, Tesla\u2019s $1.5 billion purchase of bitcoin amounted to about 8% of Tesla\u2019s cash equivalents when it was announced earlier in February. That position had already swelled by about $1 billion when bitcoin surged past $58,000 to hit a new all-time high before the cryptocurrency collapsed this week back down to about $48,000.

Its CEO Michael Saylor told Yahoo Finance earlier this month that other businesses were likely to follow Tesla and Square in adding bitcoin to its cash holdings. He made his prediction shortly after holding a virtual conference with about 1,000 business leaders and just before his company filed to raise more than $500 million to purchase more bitcoin. Saylor was quick to take to Twitter to celebrate Jack Dorsey leading Square to double down on bitcoin in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nSquare announced today that it has purchased ~3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million. Combined with Square\u2019s previous purchase of $50 million in #bitcoin, this represents ~five percent of total cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities as of 12/31/2020\n\n\u2014 Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) February 23, 2021\n\nSquare shares fell by about 5% in after-hours trading after reporting mixed results.

The elevated activity could be an indicator of rising bitcoin demand from institutional investors.\n\nInstitutional interest in bitcoin is also reflected in another market indicator called the Coinbase premium, a measurement of the price difference between Coinbase Pro\u2019s BTC/USD pair and Binance\u2019s BTC/USDT pair, said CryptoQuant\u2019s Ki.

cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen said bitcoin was \"inefficient\" as a means of payment and highly speculative.\n\nAnalysts also pointed to tweet from Elon Musk over the weekend saying bitcoin and ethereum prices \"seem high.\"\n\n\"Tesla and bitcoin are increasingly tied together and the latter had a crazy day, trading down -16.53% at one point before closing -4.21% in its worst daily performance this month,\" said Jim Reid, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"It\u2019s not clear if the moves were prompted by a delayed reaction to an Elon Musk tweet on Saturday in which he said that the bitcoin did 'seem high'.\"\n\nThe slump follows a surge over the last few months that has propelled the market to new highs. Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Tesla scores about $1 billion in profits from Bitcoin: Wedbush's Dan Ives", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/DRFv6hd8jl8ukNhrQl4EXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1790a240-37e3-11ea-bd6c-b09fddc3cadb", "auther": "Ines Ferr\u00e9", "body": "Tesla's (TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the electric vehicle company about $1 billion in profits \u2014 at least on paper, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives.\n\n\"That\u2019s more than all they made on EV vehicles in 2020, but that continues to be the double-edge sword. It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC.

From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD. And we see 2,342 to be the next target for ETH/USD for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Support Zone with $1775.00 Setting the Tone \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into .7916 \n-  NZD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Strengthens Over .7232, Weakens Under .7206 \n-  Stocks Move Higher Despite Rising Bond Yields \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n"}, {"headline": "Valid Points: How CME Ether Futures Work and Why They Matter", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Wq00tZtkHE.2hxhjF86mLA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/8fa5189d0a92dc9194382bb6e8e158e3", "auther": "Christine Kim and William Foxley", "body": "Trading in ether futures went live on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) late last Sunday with the February contract registering an opening price of $1,669.75.\u00a0\n\nIn less than two weeks, the open price of the February contract has jumped 5% to $1747.75 as ether spot prices have continued to climb upwards of $1,700.\n\nIn terms of weekly trading volume, CME ether futures contracts surpassed $160 million in its first full week of trading.\u00a0\n\nRelated: How to Bring Off-Chain Assets to DeFi\n\nAccording to Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, the initial activity of the CME\u2019s market for ether futures is promising but there\u2019s still a long way to go before the product is fully established and mature enough to support other derivatives products such as options.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a really good job the first few days but obviously we want to see more in terms of on-screen liquidity. Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

The cryptocurrency had dipped below $48,000 on Tuesday at the time of Square\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cAligned with the company\u2019s purpose, Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment, providing a way for individuals to participate in a global monetary system and secure their own financial future,\u201d the company wrote in a press release ahead of its earnings call. \u201cThe investment is part of Square\u2019s ongoing commitment to bitcoin, and the company plans to assess its aggregate investment in bitcoin relative to its other investments on an ongoing basis.\u201d\n\nSquare had earlier purchased about $50 million in bitcoin in October 2020. At the time, the purchase amounted to about 1% of the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFor comparison, Tesla\u2019s $1.5 billion purchase of bitcoin amounted to about 8% of Tesla\u2019s cash equivalents when it was announced earlier in February. That position had already swelled by about $1 billion when bitcoin surged past $58,000 to hit a new all-time high before the cryptocurrency collapsed this week back down to about $48,000.

Its CEO Michael Saylor told Yahoo Finance earlier this month that other businesses were likely to follow Tesla and Square in adding bitcoin to its cash holdings. He made his prediction shortly after holding a virtual conference with about 1,000 business leaders and just before his company filed to raise more than $500 million to purchase more bitcoin. Saylor was quick to take to Twitter to celebrate Jack Dorsey leading Square to double down on bitcoin in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nSquare announced today that it has purchased ~3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million. Combined with Square\u2019s previous purchase of $50 million in #bitcoin, this represents ~five percent of total cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities as of 12/31/2020\n\n\u2014 Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) February 23, 2021\n\nSquare shares fell by about 5% in after-hours trading after reporting mixed results.

Now at the three-times range extension and new record highs though, and I\u2019m in no hurry to chase this one either.\n\nAbove $335, and a run to $350 is possible, then $380. A break of the 10-week moving average will eventually happen, putting the 21-week moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nTuesday was Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). Wednesday was Bitcoin Cash (CCC:BCH-USD). Thursday was Etherium (CCC:ETH-USD). Now let\u2019s look at Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) as we wrap up the crypto week and as bitcoin hits a $1 trillion market capitalization today.\n\nLitecoin had a pretty rough correction from its 2019 high at $146.95 down to its 2020 low at $24.85. However, it\u2019s been on fire over the last few months.\n\nShares ripped up through the prior 2019 high, then consolidated its gains by finding support at the 10-week moving average. Once that consolidation ended though, it was off to the races again.\n\nNow pushing through the 161.8% extension, let\u2019s see if Litecoin can push up to $250, then $269.50, as the two-times range extension comes into play near the latter.\n-  7 Stocks Riding the Crypto Craze \n\nOn the downside, I would love to see the 161.8% extension act as support, as well as $200. Below puts this week\u2019s low in play near $186.50.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nLast but not least is Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL). Up almost 17% this week, shares are rallying into earnings scheduled for Monday.\n\nThis one has been on fire, reclaiming its 10-day, 21-day, 50-day and 100-day moving averages amid the four-day rally. It doesn\u2019t look like much after such a wide trading range over the last year, but it\u2019s a nice run. Ahead of earnings does make it a little tricky, though.\n\nOver the 50% retracement and its short-term moving averages puts the bulls in control for the moment. On a bullish earnings reaction, let\u2019s see if shares can clear the recent high near $85. Above puts the 61.8% retracement in play, then the $100 mark.\n\nOn a bearish reaction, see if RCL stock holds the 100-day moving average \u2014 the lowest of the four listed above. Below uptrend support (blue line) and the 38.2% retracement and 200-day moving average are in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  Top Stock Picker Reveals His Next Potential Winner \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen said bitcoin was \"inefficient\" as a means of payment and highly speculative.\n\nAnalysts also pointed to tweet from Elon Musk over the weekend saying bitcoin and ethereum prices \"seem high.\"\n\n\"Tesla and bitcoin are increasingly tied together and the latter had a crazy day, trading down -16.53% at one point before closing -4.21% in its worst daily performance this month,\" said Jim Reid, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"It\u2019s not clear if the moves were prompted by a delayed reaction to an Elon Musk tweet on Saturday in which he said that the bitcoin did 'seem high'.\"\n\nThe slump follows a surge over the last few months that has propelled the market to new highs. Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Tesla scores about $1 billion in profits from Bitcoin: Wedbush's Dan Ives", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/DRFv6hd8jl8ukNhrQl4EXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1790a240-37e3-11ea-bd6c-b09fddc3cadb", "auther": "Ines Ferr\u00e9", "body": "Tesla's (TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the electric vehicle company about $1 billion in profits \u2014 at least on paper, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives.\n\n\"That\u2019s more than all they made on EV vehicles in 2020, but that continues to be the double-edge sword.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

The cryptocurrency had dipped below $48,000 on Tuesday at the time of Square\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cAligned with the company\u2019s purpose, Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment, providing a way for individuals to participate in a global monetary system and secure their own financial future,\u201d the company wrote in a press release ahead of its earnings call. \u201cThe investment is part of Square\u2019s ongoing commitment to bitcoin, and the company plans to assess its aggregate investment in bitcoin relative to its other investments on an ongoing basis.\u201d\n\nSquare had earlier purchased about $50 million in bitcoin in October 2020. At the time, the purchase amounted to about 1% of the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFor comparison, Tesla\u2019s $1.5 billion purchase of bitcoin amounted to about 8% of Tesla\u2019s cash equivalents when it was announced earlier in February. That position had already swelled by about $1 billion when bitcoin surged past $58,000 to hit a new all-time high before the cryptocurrency collapsed this week back down to about $48,000.

Its CEO Michael Saylor told Yahoo Finance earlier this month that other businesses were likely to follow Tesla and Square in adding bitcoin to its cash holdings. He made his prediction shortly after holding a virtual conference with about 1,000 business leaders and just before his company filed to raise more than $500 million to purchase more bitcoin. Saylor was quick to take to Twitter to celebrate Jack Dorsey leading Square to double down on bitcoin in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nSquare announced today that it has purchased ~3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million. Combined with Square\u2019s previous purchase of $50 million in #bitcoin, this represents ~five percent of total cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities as of 12/31/2020\n\n\u2014 Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) February 23, 2021\n\nSquare shares fell by about 5% in after-hours trading after reporting mixed results.

cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen said bitcoin was \"inefficient\" as a means of payment and highly speculative.\n\nAnalysts also pointed to tweet from Elon Musk over the weekend saying bitcoin and ethereum prices \"seem high.\"\n\n\"Tesla and bitcoin are increasingly tied together and the latter had a crazy day, trading down -16.53% at one point before closing -4.21% in its worst daily performance this month,\" said Jim Reid, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"It\u2019s not clear if the moves were prompted by a delayed reaction to an Elon Musk tweet on Saturday in which he said that the bitcoin did 'seem high'.\"\n\nThe slump follows a surge over the last few months that has propelled the market to new highs. Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Tesla scores about $1 billion in profits from Bitcoin: Wedbush's Dan Ives", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/DRFv6hd8jl8ukNhrQl4EXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1790a240-37e3-11ea-bd6c-b09fddc3cadb", "auther": "Ines Ferr\u00e9", "body": "Tesla's (TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the electric vehicle company about $1 billion in profits \u2014 at least on paper, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives.\n\n\"That\u2019s more than all they made on EV vehicles in 2020, but that continues to be the double-edge sword. It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD. And we see 2,342 to be the next target for ETH/USD for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Support Zone with $1775.00 Setting the Tone \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into .7916 \n-  NZD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Strengthens Over .7232, Weakens Under .7206 \n-  Stocks Move Higher Despite Rising Bond Yields \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n"}, {"headline": "Valid Points: How CME Ether Futures Work and Why They Matter", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Wq00tZtkHE.2hxhjF86mLA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/8fa5189d0a92dc9194382bb6e8e158e3", "auther": "Christine Kim and William Foxley", "body": "Trading in ether futures went live on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) late last Sunday with the February contract registering an opening price of $1,669.75.\u00a0\n\nIn less than two weeks, the open price of the February contract has jumped 5% to $1747.75 as ether spot prices have continued to climb upwards of $1,700.\n\nIn terms of weekly trading volume, CME ether futures contracts surpassed $160 million in its first full week of trading.\u00a0\n\nRelated: How to Bring Off-Chain Assets to DeFi\n\nAccording to Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, the initial activity of the CME\u2019s market for ether futures is promising but there\u2019s still a long way to go before the product is fully established and mature enough to support other derivatives products such as options.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a really good job the first few days but obviously we want to see more in terms of on-screen liquidity. Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

The cryptocurrency had dipped below $48,000 on Tuesday at the time of Square\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cAligned with the company\u2019s purpose, Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment, providing a way for individuals to participate in a global monetary system and secure their own financial future,\u201d the company wrote in a press release ahead of its earnings call. \u201cThe investment is part of Square\u2019s ongoing commitment to bitcoin, and the company plans to assess its aggregate investment in bitcoin relative to its other investments on an ongoing basis.\u201d\n\nSquare had earlier purchased about $50 million in bitcoin in October 2020. At the time, the purchase amounted to about 1% of the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFor comparison, Tesla\u2019s $1.5 billion purchase of bitcoin amounted to about 8% of Tesla\u2019s cash equivalents when it was announced earlier in February. That position had already swelled by about $1 billion when bitcoin surged past $58,000 to hit a new all-time high before the cryptocurrency collapsed this week back down to about $48,000.

He made his prediction shortly after holding a virtual conference with about 1,000 business leaders and just before his company filed to raise more than $500 million to purchase more bitcoin. Saylor was quick to take to Twitter to celebrate Jack Dorsey leading Square to double down on bitcoin in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nSquare announced today that it has purchased ~3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million. Combined with Square\u2019s previous purchase of $50 million in #bitcoin, this represents ~five percent of total cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities as of 12/31/2020\n\n\u2014 Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) February 23, 2021\n\nSquare shares fell by about 5% in after-hours trading after reporting mixed results.

The rise has coincided with a surge of populism in financial markets around the world.\n\nDogecoin hit a new all-time high this month, as celebrity attention including rapper Snoop Dogg continued to buoy up the price of the joke token.\n\nREAD MORE: Dogecoin hits new high after Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg tweets\n\nThe digital currency, which uses a Shiba Inu dog as its mascot, first started up as a joke in 2013 but has seen its market capitalisation pass $6bn.\n\nMusk first tweeted just the word \u201cDoge,\u201d followed by \u201cDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto,\u201d and \u201cNo highs, no lows, only Doge.\u201d He also posted a Lion King meme of him holding up the dogecoin dog as if it were Simba.\n\nHe said at the time: \"They are really just meant to be jokes, but you know Dogecoin was made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies obviously, but fate loves irony and often as a friend of mine says that the most ironic outcome or I'd say the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of earth in the future.\u201d\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n"}, {"headline": "4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: BA, DE, Litecoin, RCL", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/I_GHyyLeQaHlxgIMX3eotg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investorplace_417/13522e8441308910763ccbb76de3f676", "auther": "Bret Kenwell", "body": "It was an up-and-down session that\u2019s now mostly flat for the S&P 500.

Since then, we\u2019ve had back-to-back tight-ranged weeks.\n\nOn the plus side, earnings are out of the way and Boeing continues to hold over the 10-week moving average. Moving nicely on Friday, bulls will be looking for Boeing to give us a two-times weekly-up rotation by clearing the highs from the prior two weeks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf it can do that, as well as hurdle the 50% retracement, the $234 level could be in play, followed by the December high near $244. Above that puts the 61.8% retracement on the table near $250.\n-  7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don\u2019t Get Tired Of \n\nOn the downside, a break of the 10-week moving average puts the 21-week moving average on deck, followed by the $188 to $190 area.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nMan, what else can we say about Deere (NYSE:DE) at this point? The stock looks like a high-flying tech holding more than an industrial/agriculture company. That said, it does have some tech components to the business model.\n\nRegardless, this stock has been moving straight up for months now. Each dip to the 10-week moving average \u2014 including this week \u2014 has been bought aggressively by the bulls.\n\nThe institutional support is robust with this one, which would have me crossing it off my \u201cshort list\u201d in a hurry. Now at the three-times range extension and new record highs though, and I\u2019m in no hurry to chase this one either.\n\nAbove $335, and a run to $350 is possible, then $380. A break of the 10-week moving average will eventually happen, putting the 21-week moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nTuesday was Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). Wednesday was Bitcoin Cash (CCC:BCH-USD). Thursday was Etherium (CCC:ETH-USD). Now let\u2019s look at Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) as we wrap up the crypto week and as bitcoin hits a $1 trillion market capitalization today.\n\nLitecoin had a pretty rough correction from its 2019 high at $146.95 down to its 2020 low at $24.85. However, it\u2019s been on fire over the last few months.\n\nShares ripped up through the prior 2019 high, then consolidated its gains by finding support at the 10-week moving average. Once that consolidation ended though, it was off to the races again.\n\nNow pushing through the 161.8% extension, let\u2019s see if Litecoin can push up to $250, then $269.50, as the two-times range extension comes into play near the latter.\n-  7 Stocks Riding the Crypto Craze \n\nOn the downside, I would love to see the 161.8% extension act as support, as well as $200.

Up almost 17% this week, shares are rallying into earnings scheduled for Monday.\n\nThis one has been on fire, reclaiming its 10-day, 21-day, 50-day and 100-day moving averages amid the four-day rally. It doesn\u2019t look like much after such a wide trading range over the last year, but it\u2019s a nice run. Ahead of earnings does make it a little tricky, though.\n\nOver the 50% retracement and its short-term moving averages puts the bulls in control for the moment. On a bullish earnings reaction, let\u2019s see if shares can clear the recent high near $85. Above puts the 61.8% retracement in play, then the $100 mark.\n\nOn a bearish reaction, see if RCL stock holds the 100-day moving average \u2014 the lowest of the four listed above.
