dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn\u2019t get buy-in to his proposal.\n\nIf you want to find out more information about Ethereum or cryptocurrencies in general, then use the search box at the top of this page.

It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: Arcane Research: Banking on Bitcoin \u2013 The State of Bitcoin As Collateral\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nazarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei. Gas fees are currently at historic highs with an average transaction surpassing $40 Tuesday, according to Blockchair.\n\nRelated: US Central Bank Explains 'Preconditions' for a Digital Dollar\n\nNot only will the update lessen congestion on Ethereum, but it should decrease call latency, Nazarov said.\n\n\u201cReally what OCR does is take the computation we were doing on-chain and porting it out to an off-chain environment, and that is creating a very large 10x increase in efficiency, which means we can put a lot more data on-chain,\u201d Nazarov said.\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin leads cryptocurrency market sell-off", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/vw1fdt06miUfG.jz01liHA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/1be9f990-75ae-11eb-b69e-3032bd328801", "auther": "Oscar Williams-Grut", "body": "A sharp and broad-based sell-off has hit the cryptocurrency market, piercing a recent bull run powered by corporate and retail interest alike.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top.

Above puts the 61.8% retracement in play, then the $100 mark.\n\nOn a bearish reaction, see if RCL stock holds the 100-day moving average \u2014 the lowest of the four listed above. Below uptrend support (blue line) and the 38.2% retracement and 200-day moving average are in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  Top Stock Picker Reveals His Next Potential Winner \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

It has gained almost 20% this week.\n\nIn December it soared past Visa (V) to make it the world\u2019s largest financial service.\n\nBitcoin has been fuelled of late by acceptance from mainstream investors and companies, such as Tesla (TSLA) and Mastercard (MA).\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla invested $1.5bn in the cryptocurrency, and said it may even start accepting it as payment for its products.\n\nIn a filing with the SEC, Tesla said it has \u201cinvested an aggregate $1.5bn in bitcoin,\u201d and \u201cmay acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term.\u201d\n\nIt added that it expects to \u201cbegin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for [its] products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which [it] may or may not liquidate upon receipt.\u201d\n\nIts popularity has also been boosted by Tesla\u2019s founder Elon Musk, who has often been seen tweeting about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe publicly declared on Thursday that he favours it to fiat currency as global interest rates are currently at record lows, saying Bitcoin is a \u201cless dumb form of liquidity than cash.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be clear, I am not an investor, I am an engineer,\u201d he said on Twitter. \"I don\u2019t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHowever, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn\u2019t look elsewhere. Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is 'almost'.\n\nMusk also defended Tesla\u2019s move to invest by saying Bitcoin is \u201cadventurous enough for an S&P 500 company.\u201d\n\nWatch: What is Bitcoin?\n\nLast night he changed his Twitter profile picture to Bitcoin \u201cjust for the day,\u201d tweeting \u201cI just want to start a flame in your heart.\u201d\n\nBitcoin started 2020 at around $7,000 per coin. Despite its rise in the last year, the cryptocurrency remains extremely volatile and experts continue to remain sceptical about using it as an investment.\n\nHowever, a survey published last week showed almost two-thirds of UK investors intend to buy bitcoin in 2021 and well over half expect its value to increase to $60,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD), the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, also hit a record overnight, touching over $2,000 for the first time in its history.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of dogecoin (DOGE-USD) has also surged in recent weeks after Musk began tweeting about it. The rise has coincided with a surge of populism in financial markets around the world.\n\nDogecoin hit a new all-time high this month, as celebrity attention including rapper Snoop Dogg continued to buoy up the price of the joke token.\n\nREAD MORE: Dogecoin hits new high after Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg tweets\n\nThe digital currency, which uses a Shiba Inu dog as its mascot, first started up as a joke in 2013 but has seen its market capitalisation pass $6bn.\n\nMusk first tweeted just the word \u201cDoge,\u201d followed by \u201cDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto,\u201d and \u201cNo highs, no lows, only Doge.\u201d He also posted a Lion King meme of him holding up the dogecoin dog as if it were Simba.\n\nHe said at the time: \"They are really just meant to be jokes, but you know Dogecoin was made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies obviously, but fate loves irony and often as a friend of mine says that the most ironic outcome or I'd say the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of earth in the future.\u201d\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n"}, {"headline": "Square buys $170 million more in bitcoin to boost crypto holdings", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance via AOL", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/gWo4Hd5FyIfspmCQIKmyFw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-02/23/603575449505d758f6d8c951/603575449505d758f6d8c952_o_U_v2.jpg", "auther": "Yahoo Finance via AOL", "body": "Square (SQ) announced Tuesday it bought $170 million worth of bitcoin to add to its expanding position.\n\nThe new purchase from the payments company now brings its total bitcoin holdings to approximately 5% of its cash and cash equivalents. Averaging out the 3,318 bitcoins Square says it purchased would indicate an average price of about $51,235 per bitcoin (BTC-USD). The cryptocurrency had dipped below $48,000 on Tuesday at the time of Square\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cAligned with the company\u2019s purpose, Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment, providing a way for individuals to participate in a global monetary system and secure their own financial future,\u201d the company wrote in a press release ahead of its earnings call. \u201cThe investment is part of Square\u2019s ongoing commitment to bitcoin, and the company plans to assess its aggregate investment in bitcoin relative to its other investments on an ongoing basis.\u201d\n\nSquare had earlier purchased about $50 million in bitcoin in October 2020. At the time, the purchase amounted to about 1% of the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFor comparison, Tesla\u2019s $1.5 billion purchase of bitcoin amounted to about 8% of Tesla\u2019s cash equivalents when it was announced earlier in February. That position had already swelled by about $1 billion when bitcoin surged past $58,000 to hit a new all-time high before the cryptocurrency collapsed this week back down to about $48,000. This weekend, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the price of bitcoin seemed, \u201chigh.\u201d\n\nThat said, BTC & ETH do seem high lol\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 20, 2021\n\nBusiness intelligence software company MicroStrategy was the first publicly traded company to add bitcoin to its balance sheet last year. Its CEO Michael Saylor told Yahoo Finance earlier this month that other businesses were likely to follow Tesla and Square in adding bitcoin to its cash holdings. He made his prediction shortly after holding a virtual conference with about 1,000 business leaders and just before his company filed to raise more than $500 million to purchase more bitcoin. Saylor was quick to take to Twitter to celebrate Jack Dorsey leading Square to double down on bitcoin in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nSquare announced today that it has purchased ~3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million. Combined with Square\u2019s previous purchase of $50 million in #bitcoin, this represents ~five percent of total cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities as of 12/31/2020\n\n\u2014 Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) February 23, 2021\n\nSquare shares fell by about 5% in after-hours trading after reporting mixed results. Bitcoin was little changed after Square\u2019s announcement, hovering around $48,000.\n\nZack Guzman is an anchor for Yahoo Finance Live as well as a senior writer covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.

dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn\u2019t get buy-in to his proposal.\n\nIf you want to find out more information about Ethereum or cryptocurrencies in general, then use the search box at the top of this page.

It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices. Over the weekend \u2014 responding to a tweet - Musk indicated Bitcoin and Etherium (ETH-USD) could be high. That sent Bitcoin well below $50,000, thought it jumped back around $53,000 during Monday's session.\n\nThat said, BTC & ETH do seem high lol\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 20, 2021\n\nShares of Tesla on Monday were down more than 4% as they have recently broken some key support levels. The stock was sitting around $870 in early February. It touched an intraday high of $900.40 on January 25th.\n\n\"I think we\u2019re just in the early innings of the EV story playing out.

Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Saylor was quick to take to Twitter to celebrate Jack Dorsey leading Square to double down on bitcoin in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nSquare announced today that it has purchased ~3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million. Combined with Square\u2019s previous purchase of $50 million in #bitcoin, this represents ~five percent of total cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities as of 12/31/2020\n\n\u2014 Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) February 23, 2021\n\nSquare shares fell by about 5% in after-hours trading after reporting mixed results. Bitcoin was little changed after Square\u2019s announcement, hovering around $48,000.\n\nZack Guzman is an anchor for Yahoo Finance Live as well as a senior writer covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.

dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn\u2019t get buy-in to his proposal.\n\nIf you want to find out more information about Ethereum or cryptocurrencies in general, then use the search box at the top of this page.

It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top.

Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: Arcane Research: Banking on Bitcoin \u2013 The State of Bitcoin As Collateral\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nazarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei. Gas fees are currently at historic highs with an average transaction surpassing $40 Tuesday, according to Blockchair.\n\nRelated: US Central Bank Explains 'Preconditions' for a Digital Dollar\n\nNot only will the update lessen congestion on Ethereum, but it should decrease call latency, Nazarov said.\n\n\u201cReally what OCR does is take the computation we were doing on-chain and porting it out to an off-chain environment, and that is creating a very large 10x increase in efficiency, which means we can put a lot more data on-chain,\u201d Nazarov said.\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin leads cryptocurrency market sell-off", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/vw1fdt06miUfG.jz01liHA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/1be9f990-75ae-11eb-b69e-3032bd328801", "auther": "Oscar Williams-Grut", "body": "A sharp and broad-based sell-off has hit the cryptocurrency market, piercing a recent bull run powered by corporate and retail interest alike.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of

30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language.

It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: Arcane Research: Banking on Bitcoin \u2013 The State of Bitcoin As Collateral\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nazarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei. Gas fees are currently at historic highs with an average transaction surpassing $40 Tuesday, according to Blockchair.\n\nRelated: US Central Bank Explains 'Preconditions' for a Digital Dollar\n\nNot only will the update lessen congestion on Ethereum, but it should decrease call latency, Nazarov said.\n\n\u201cReally what OCR does is take the computation we were doing on-chain and porting it out to an off-chain environment, and that is creating a very large 10x increase in efficiency, which means we can put a lot more data on-chain,\u201d Nazarov said.\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin leads cryptocurrency market sell-off", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/vw1fdt06miUfG.jz01liHA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/1be9f990-75ae-11eb-b69e-3032bd328801", "auther": "Oscar Williams-Grut", "body": "A sharp and broad-based sell-off has hit the cryptocurrency market, piercing a recent bull run powered by corporate and retail interest alike.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen said bitcoin was \"inefficient\" as a means of payment and highly speculative.\n\nAnalysts also pointed to tweet from Elon Musk over the weekend saying bitcoin and ethereum prices \"seem high.\"\n\n\"Tesla and bitcoin are increasingly tied together and the latter had a crazy day, trading down -16.53% at one point before closing -4.21% in its worst daily performance this month,\" said Jim Reid, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"It\u2019s not clear if the moves were prompted by a delayed reaction to an Elon Musk tweet on Saturday in which he said that the bitcoin did 'seem high'.\"\n\nThe slump follows a surge over the last few months that has propelled the market to new highs. Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "DeFi Tech, CeFi Speed: dYdX Touts New StarkWare Integration", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/MpHfICs7RZt5VjC40w206A--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/10b142a491c7fe36ccc61908814e56c1", "auther": "William Foxley", "body": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) trading venue dYdX is now onboarding users to a new version of its platform built on StarkWare\u2019s Cairo software.\n\nCross-margin perpetuals are now available to early signups at zero gas fees thanks to a proprietary implementation of the layer 2 solution.

dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn\u2019t get buy-in to his proposal.\n\nIf you want to find out more information about Ethereum or cryptocurrencies in general, then use the search box at the top of this page.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: Arcane Research: Banking on Bitcoin \u2013 The State of Bitcoin As Collateral\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nazarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei. Gas fees are currently at historic highs with an average transaction surpassing $40 Tuesday, according to Blockchair.\n\nRelated: US Central Bank Explains 'Preconditions' for a Digital Dollar\n\nNot only will the update lessen congestion on Ethereum, but it should decrease call latency, Nazarov said.\n\n\u201cReally what OCR does is take the computation we were doing on-chain and porting it out to an off-chain environment, and that is creating a very large 10x increase in efficiency, which means we can put a lot more data on-chain,\u201d Nazarov said.\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin leads cryptocurrency market sell-off", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/vw1fdt06miUfG.jz01liHA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/1be9f990-75ae-11eb-b69e-3032bd328801", "auther": "Oscar Williams-Grut", "body": "A sharp and broad-based sell-off has hit the cryptocurrency market, piercing a recent bull run powered by corporate and retail interest alike.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market has tanked 14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

It has gained almost 20% this week.\n\nIn December it soared past Visa (V) to make it the world\u2019s largest financial service.\n\nBitcoin has been fuelled of late by acceptance from mainstream investors and companies, such as Tesla (TSLA) and Mastercard (MA).\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla invested $1.5bn in the cryptocurrency, and said it may even start accepting it as payment for its products.\n\nIn a filing with the SEC, Tesla said it has \u201cinvested an aggregate $1.5bn in bitcoin,\u201d and \u201cmay acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term.\u201d\n\nIt added that it expects to \u201cbegin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for [its] products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which [it] may or may not liquidate upon receipt.\u201d\n\nIts popularity has also been boosted by Tesla\u2019s founder Elon Musk, who has often been seen tweeting about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe publicly declared on Thursday that he favours it to fiat currency as global interest rates are currently at record lows, saying Bitcoin is a \u201cless dumb form of liquidity than cash.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be clear, I am not an investor, I am an engineer,\u201d he said on Twitter. \"I don\u2019t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHowever, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn\u2019t look elsewhere. Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is 'almost'.\n\nMusk also defended Tesla\u2019s move to invest by saying Bitcoin is \u201cadventurous enough for an S&P 500 company.\u201d\n\nWatch: What is Bitcoin?\n\nLast night he changed his Twitter profile picture to Bitcoin \u201cjust for the day,\u201d tweeting \u201cI just want to start a flame in your heart.\u201d\n\nBitcoin started 2020 at around $7,000 per coin. Despite its rise in the last year, the cryptocurrency remains extremely volatile and experts continue to remain sceptical about using it as an investment.\n\nHowever, a survey published last week showed almost two-thirds of UK investors intend to buy bitcoin in 2021 and well over half expect its value to increase to $60,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD), the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, also hit a record overnight, touching over $2,000 for the first time in its history.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of dogecoin (DOGE-USD) has also surged in recent weeks after Musk began tweeting about it. The rise has coincided with a surge of populism in financial markets around the world.\n\nDogecoin hit a new all-time high this month, as celebrity attention including rapper Snoop Dogg continued to buoy up the price of the joke token.\n\nREAD MORE: Dogecoin hits new high after Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg tweets\n\nThe digital currency, which uses a Shiba Inu dog as its mascot, first started up as a joke in 2013 but has seen its market capitalisation pass $6bn.\n\nMusk first tweeted just the word \u201cDoge,\u201d followed by \u201cDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto,\u201d and \u201cNo highs, no lows, only Doge.\u201d He also posted a Lion King meme of him holding up the dogecoin dog as if it were Simba.\n\nHe said at the time: \"They are really just meant to be jokes, but you know Dogecoin was made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies obviously, but fate loves irony and often as a friend of mine says that the most ironic outcome or I'd say the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of earth in the future.\u201d\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n"}, {"headline": "Square buys $170 million more in bitcoin to boost crypto holdings", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance via AOL", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/gWo4Hd5FyIfspmCQIKmyFw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-02/23/603575449505d758f6d8c951/603575449505d758f6d8c952_o_U_v2.jpg", "auther": "Yahoo Finance via AOL", "body": "Square (SQ) announced Tuesday it bought $170 million worth of bitcoin to add to its expanding position.\n\nThe new purchase from the payments company now brings its total bitcoin holdings to approximately 5% of its cash and cash equivalents. Averaging out the 3,318 bitcoins Square says it purchased would indicate an average price of about $51,235 per bitcoin (BTC-USD). The cryptocurrency had dipped below $48,000 on Tuesday at the time of Square\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cAligned with the company\u2019s purpose, Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment, providing a way for individuals to participate in a global monetary system and secure their own financial future,\u201d the company wrote in a press release ahead of its earnings call. \u201cThe investment is part of Square\u2019s ongoing commitment to bitcoin, and the company plans to assess its aggregate investment in bitcoin relative to its other investments on an ongoing basis.\u201d\n\nSquare had earlier purchased about $50 million in bitcoin in October 2020. At the time, the purchase amounted to about 1% of the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFor comparison, Tesla\u2019s $1.5 billion purchase of bitcoin amounted to about 8% of Tesla\u2019s cash equivalents when it was announced earlier in February. That position had already swelled by about $1 billion when bitcoin surged past $58,000 to hit a new all-time high before the cryptocurrency collapsed this week back down to about $48,000. This weekend, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the price of bitcoin seemed, \u201chigh.\u201d\n\nThat said, BTC & ETH do seem high lol\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 20, 2021\n\nBusiness intelligence software company MicroStrategy was the first publicly traded company to add bitcoin to its balance sheet last year. Its CEO Michael Saylor told Yahoo Finance earlier this month that other businesses were likely to follow Tesla and Square in adding bitcoin to its cash holdings. He made his prediction shortly after holding a virtual conference with about 1,000 business leaders and just before his company filed to raise more than $500 million to purchase more bitcoin. Saylor was quick to take to Twitter to celebrate Jack Dorsey leading Square to double down on bitcoin in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nSquare announced today that it has purchased ~3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million. Combined with Square\u2019s previous purchase of $50 million in #bitcoin, this represents ~five percent of total cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities as of 12/31/2020\n\n\u2014 Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) February 23, 2021\n\nSquare shares fell by about 5% in after-hours trading after reporting mixed results. Bitcoin was little changed after Square\u2019s announcement, hovering around $48,000.\n\nZack Guzman is an anchor for Yahoo Finance Live as well as a senior writer covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.

dramatic 30% move to the downside after failing to establish a level of support above its all-time high of $2,000.\n\nIn the immediate future $1,695 remains a key level of resistance to the upside, as this was a prior point of rejection earlier this month.\n\nThe slump in price coincided with a crash in the price of Bitcoin, which fell from $58,500 to as low as $45,000 before finding some bullish support.\n\nETHUSD chart by TradingView\n\nThe trajectory over the coming weeks and months is delicately poised, with the industry currently being subject to a period of increased institutional adoption.\n\nEthereum futures was listed on CME earlier this month, with trade volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $100 million.\n\nThere has also been a rising trend of interest in DeFi lending products, most of which are based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile by nature, and if Ethereum\u2019s $1,350 level of support breaks, it will likely go on to test $1,000 before the end of the month.\n\nFor more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.\n\nEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.\n\nButerin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn\u2019t get buy-in to his proposal.\n\nIf you want to find out more information about Ethereum or cryptocurrencies in general, then use the search box at the top of this page.

It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices. Over the weekend \u2014 responding to a tweet - Musk indicated Bitcoin and Etherium (ETH-USD) could be high. That sent Bitcoin well below $50,000, thought it jumped back around $53,000 during Monday's session.\n\nThat said, BTC & ETH do seem high lol\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 20, 2021\n\nShares of Tesla on Monday were down more than 4% as they have recently broken some key support levels.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain.

The rise has coincided with a surge of populism in financial markets around the world.\n\nDogecoin hit a new all-time high this month, as celebrity attention including rapper Snoop Dogg continued to buoy up the price of the joke token.\n\nREAD MORE: Dogecoin hits new high after Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg tweets\n\nThe digital currency, which uses a Shiba Inu dog as its mascot, first started up as a joke in 2013 but has seen its market capitalisation pass $6bn.\n\nMusk first tweeted just the word \u201cDoge,\u201d followed by \u201cDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto,\u201d and \u201cNo highs, no lows, only Doge.\u201d He also posted a Lion King meme of him holding up the dogecoin dog as if it were Simba.\n\nHe said at the time: \"They are really just meant to be jokes, but you know Dogecoin was made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies obviously, but fate loves irony and often as a friend of mine says that the most ironic outcome or I'd say the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of earth in the future.\u201d\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n"}, {"headline": "Square buys $170 million more in bitcoin to boost crypto holdings", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance via AOL", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/gWo4Hd5FyIfspmCQIKmyFw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-02/23/603575449505d758f6d8c951/603575449505d758f6d8c952_o_U_v2.jpg", "auther": "Yahoo Finance via AOL", "body": "Square (SQ) announced Tuesday it bought $170 million worth of bitcoin to add to its expanding position.\n\nThe new purchase from the payments company now brings its total bitcoin holdings to approximately 5% of its cash and cash equivalents. Averaging out the 3,318 bitcoins Square says it purchased would indicate an average price of about $51,235 per bitcoin (BTC-USD). The cryptocurrency had dipped below $48,000 on Tuesday at the time of Square\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cAligned with the company\u2019s purpose, Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment, providing a way for individuals to participate in a global monetary system and secure their own financial future,\u201d the company wrote in a press release ahead of its earnings call. \u201cThe investment is part of Square\u2019s ongoing commitment to bitcoin, and the company plans to assess its aggregate investment in bitcoin relative to its other investments on an ongoing basis.\u201d\n\nSquare had earlier purchased about $50 million in bitcoin in October 2020. At the time, the purchase amounted to about 1% of the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFor comparison, Tesla\u2019s $1.5 billion purchase of bitcoin amounted to about 8% of Tesla\u2019s cash equivalents when it was announced earlier in February. That position had already swelled by about $1 billion when bitcoin surged past $58,000 to hit a new all-time high before the cryptocurrency collapsed this week back down to about $48,000. This weekend, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the price of bitcoin seemed, \u201chigh.\u201d\n\nThat said, BTC & ETH do seem high lol\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 20, 2021\n\nBusiness intelligence software company MicroStrategy was the first publicly traded company to add bitcoin to its balance sheet last year. Its CEO Michael Saylor told Yahoo Finance earlier this month that other businesses were likely to follow Tesla and Square in adding bitcoin to its cash holdings. He made his prediction shortly after holding a virtual conference with about 1,000 business leaders and just before his company filed to raise more than $500 million to purchase more bitcoin. Saylor was quick to take to Twitter to celebrate Jack Dorsey leading Square to double down on bitcoin in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nSquare announced today that it has purchased ~3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million. Combined with Square\u2019s previous purchase of $50 million in #bitcoin, this represents ~five percent of total cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities as of 12/31/2020\n\n\u2014 Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) February 23, 2021\n\nSquare shares fell by about 5% in after-hours trading after reporting mixed results. Bitcoin was little changed after Square\u2019s announcement, hovering around $48,000.\n\nZack Guzman is an anchor for Yahoo Finance Live as well as a senior writer covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
