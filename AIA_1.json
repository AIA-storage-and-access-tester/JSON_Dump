"auther": "Daniel Moss", "body": "As mentioned in previous report, the haven-associated US Dollar may continue to lose ground against its major counterparts, as long-term price analysis suggests a cyclical downturn is in the offing. \n\nDXY monthly chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe chart above highlights the cyclical pattern seen in the US Dollar Index over the past 34 years, with the DXY largely adhering to what appears to be a 16-year rotation. The index set significant bottoms in 1992 and 2008. \n\nAfter bottoming out, price then seems to rebound aggressively early in the cycle, soaring 24.1% and 26.8% in 1993 and 2009 respectively, before pulling back to key support at the 88.6% Fibonacci. A 6-year period of sustained USD strength follows this counter-trend pullback, with price climbing 50.1% from the 1995 low and 42.8% from the 2011 low, to set key highs in 2001 and 2017. \n\nBearish RSI divergence in late 2002 seemed to signal the end of the US Dollar\u2019s bull run and triggered a shift in overall market sentiment, as price collapsed through uptrend support and ell 41.6% to eventually bottom in March 2008. \n\nRecent price action and the development of the RSI is strikingly similar to that seen in the first quarter of 2003 and could be indicative of further downside for the DXY, as price slices through the September 2020 low (91.75) and hurtles towards the 2018 low (88.25). \n\nAn extended downside push towards the 100% Fibonacci expansion (83.50) looks likely if the 2018 low is breached, with cycle analysis suggesting price could fall a further 23% from current levels before bottoming out in mid-2024. \n\nAUD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nThe longer-term technical outlook for AUD/USD remains overtly bullish, as price surges above the August 2020 high (0.7413) to challenge the psychologically imposing 0.7800 mark. \n\nWith the MACD hovering at its highest levels since 2011, and the RSI eyeing a push into overbought territory, the path of least resistance seems higher. \n\nA bullish \u2018golden cross\u2019 moving average formation also hints at extended gains for the exchange rate in the coming months. \n\nA weekly close above 0.7810 is required to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and clear a path for price to challenge the 2018 high (0.8136). Hurdling that likely brings the 100% Fibonacci (0.8918) into the crosshairs. \n\nHowever, if 0.7800 successfully stifles buying pressure, a short-term pullback to the yearly low (0.7564) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 38.14% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.62 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 20.49% higher than yesterday and 0.10% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 10.93% higher than yesterday and 13.40% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests AUD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is less net-short than yesterday but more net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed AUD/USD trading bias.\n\nNZD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nNZD/USD rates also seem poised to continue pushing higher, as price storms away from the support range at 0.7100 \u2013 0.7130. \n\nThe development of the RSI hints at swelling bullish momentum, as the oscillator continues to track the uptrend extending from the March lows and eyes an entry into overbought territory.\n\nA weekly close above 0.7250 likely paves the way for buyers to drive the exchange rate towards the 61.8% Fibonacci (0.7333). Breaching that opens to door for a challenge of the 2017 high (0.7558). \n\nConversely, failing to break above the psychologically imposing 0.7300 mark could allow sellers to force NZD/USD back towards the yearly low (0.7096). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 39.33% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.54 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 15.38% higher than yesterday and 17.10% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 9.95% higher than yesterday and 2.21% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests NZD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current NZD/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nUSD/CAD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nUSD/CAD looks set to extend recent losses, as price continues to track within the confines of a Descending Channel. \n\nA \u2018death cross\u2019 moving average formation, in combination with the RSI dipping to its lowest levels since 2017, suggests the path of least resistance is lower. \n\nPiercing range support at 1.2555 \u2013 1.2590 likely intensifies selling pressure and clears a path for price to challenge the 2018 low (1.2247). \n\nHowever, if support remains intact, a rebound back towards channel resistance and the 21-EMA could be in the offing (1.2599). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 72.92% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.69 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 11.33% higher than yesterday and 8.63% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 37.76% higher than yesterday and 19.61% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests USD/CAD prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is less net-long than yesterday but more net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed USD/CAD trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "GBP, AUD End Week Near 3-Year Highs | Investing.com NG", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Kathy Lien", "body": "USD Sells Off Despite Stronger PMIs\n\nGBP Breaks 1.40 On Stronger PMIs\n\nAUD Shrugs Off Weaker Retail Sales\n\nNZD, AUD Hit Highest Levels Since March 2018\n\nEUR Rally Supported By Rise In PMI\n\nCAD Unfazed By Weaker Retail Sales\n\nThere were some big moves in currencies on Friday, which was no surprise given the busy economic calendar. GBP/USD rose above 1.40 for the first time since April 2018, while AUD/USD and NZD/USD climbed to their strongest level since March 2018. Investors looked past softer economic reports in favor of stronger releases. The U.S. dollar sold off across the board as stocks rebounded from yesterday\u2019s decline. Existing home sales and PMIs were stronger.\n\nDespite surging virus cases and widespread restrictions in the U.S. and Europe, manufacturing activity continues to chug along.\u00a0The hope is that this will continue as more people are vaccinated and restrictions are eased. Next week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell will delivery his semi-annual testimony on the economy and monetary policy. He\u2019s made it clear that no rate hikes are on the horizon and it is too soon to consider tapering asset purchases. At the same time, he\u2019s optimistic about the recovery, and expects stronger growth in the second half of the year. The combination of a positive outlook and policy accommodation is good for stocks, high-beta currencies and bad for the U.S. dollar. This week\u2019s moves could be a reflection of investors positioning for the Fed\u2019s optimism.Sterling was not the day\u2019s strongest performer (that title goes to the Australian and New Zealand dollars) but the move above 1.40 is significant. Retail sales\u00a0were terrible. Consumer spending dropped 8.2% in the month of January, three times more than expected. However, sterling bulls were unfazed by this release, choosing instead to focus on stronger PMIs. Manufacturing and service sector activity improved in February, which drove the composite rate up to 49.8 from 41.2. This is significantly stronger than the 42.2 forecast. The PMIs are more forward-looking than retail sales, but consumer spending needs to recover to keep pace with manufacturing activity otherwise manufacturing will have to slow.The return of Chinese investors drove the Australian and New Zealand dollars to fresh multi-year highs.\u00a0Both currencies rose more than 1% against the greenback intraday and the breakout after a period of consolidation in AUD/USD and NZD/USD could lead to further gains in the coming week. Australian and New Zealand data was actually disappointing, with very little producer price growth in New Zealand in the fourth quarter. In Australia, manufacturing activity slowed, while retail sales growth missed expectations. These reports would normally drive AUD/USD lower, but investors are laser focused on recovery. Virus cases are extremely low in both countries and New Zealand just lifted its three-day lockdown. The Canadian dollar also shrugged off weaker retail sales. Consumer spending dropped 3.4% at the end of last year, which was worse than the -2.5% forecast.The\u00a0euro trailed behind GBP, AUD and NZD but Eurozone's economic reports were the most encouraging.\u00a0The composite PMI index increased in the month of February thanks to stronger manufacturing activity in Germany and the Eurozone. Services continued to contract, but the strong expansion in manufacturing more than made up the difference. According to the producer price report, inflationary pressures in the Germany increased at the start of the year. With that said, the gains in EUR/USD were modest as the pair hovers underneath the 50-day SMA.\n"}, {"headline": "Stronger employment data not enough to spark break outside ranges", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/VRIwxJUjyhcgHZS3hKwtmA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/8eccc72249668895a4a4b537e515b4e0", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "The Australian dollar again offered little to excite investors through trade on Thursday, failing to break outside recent ranges and continuing to bounce between 0.7730 and 0.7790 despite improved labour market conditions. Employment data showed employment levels are returning to near pre-pandemic levels, with the unemployment rate falling below 6.5% to 6.4% as another 30,000 jobs were added to the economy. The outlook continues to improve with most industries now reporting almost full employment, with job losses now targeted to those worst hit by the pandemic, namely tourism and entertainment. As the vaccine roll-out begins this month, there is hope forward indicators will show further growth moving into Q2, easing pressure on the RBA to maintain long run QE programs.\n\nWith little of note on the domestic docket our attentions turn to a raft of European and US PMI data. Markets are pricing in some slippage through February as lockdowns and frigid weather temper economic activity. We are keenly attuned to any divergence in economic performance; softness across European data sets could force the single currency back toward 1.20 and allow the AUD to test resistance at 0.6450.\n\nVolatility across currency markets remained subdued through trade on Thursday with little headline newsflow or data points to spark a wholesale shift in direction. The US dollar drifted lower against the euro, yen and pound with the latter extending its upward run toward 3-year highs. Sterling remains a target for investors and analysts, marking fresh highs at 1.3985 overnight. While domestic data shows modest signs of improvement, the end of the Brexit saga and an ambitious schedule of vaccination has fostered hopes for a robust H2 recovery.\n\nThe US dollar gave up much of Wednesday\u2019s gains following a slew of mixed macroeconomic data sets, led by softer than anticipated unemployment claims. The number of Americans filing for unemployment last week jumped from 848K to 861K, well above the 775K predicted, and a sign America\u2019s labour market still has a long way to go to recover pandemic fostered losses.\n\nOur attentions turn to a raft of manufacturing and services data across Europe and the US for direction.

Having given up 0.78 US cents, the AUD remained largely range bound through the domestic session bouncing between 0.7740 and 0.7770 before marking fresh daily and weekly lows at 0.7725 following a massive upward surprise in US retail sales. Having disappointed in December, US consumers turned out in January marking a 5.1% uptick in spending; well above the 1% anticipated. The strong print was supported by gains in PPI inflation, industrial production and home sales which suggest the US economy is stronger than first anticipated. Having drifted back toward 0.7750 on open, our attentions now turn to domestic employment data. The monthly labour market report remains a crucial measure of recovery and a key marker for the RBA. Material improvements in job creation and a depreciation in unemployment would likely mean the RBA current QE program will not extend beyond September, while a poor print ahead of relaxed Jobseeker and JobKeeper benefits, next month may prompt calls for extend stimulus, weighing on the AUD. We anticipate an improvement and reduction to 6.4%.\n\nThe dollar index advanced through trade on Wednesday up 0.3% following higher bond rates and stronger than anticipated domestic retail sales. Following a soft showing in December, consumer spending rebounded strongly in January up 5.1% month on month, well beyond the 1.1% growth anticipated and raising some concerns inflation pressures may accelerate as fiscal stimulus is introduced to the economy. The dollar advanced against both the GBP and euro driving the index higher. Sterling drifted below 1.39 and touched 1.3830 before settling above 1.3850 into this morning\u2019s open. The euro slipped below 1.21 forced to lows at 1.2030. Europe remains behind the US and UK when comparing vaccination schedules while the stronger US macroeconomic showing highlighted the divergence in economic performance and growth expectations.

Again, the price action looks corrective rather than a structural change in trend. The dollar index rose by 20 points to 90.50, smack in the middle of its recent days\u2019 trading range.\n\nThe euro fell slightly to 1.2105, edging lower again to 1.2090 this morning. The UK Pound has also declined to 1.3895 today. Both, however, remained comfortably above support, notably Sterling. Japanese yen was the big G7 mover, climbing 0.63% to 106.05 before retreating to 105.85 this morning. The rise in USD/JPY highlights its sensitivity to US/Japan rate differentials. USD/JPY is comfortably above its falling wedge and the 200-DMA, both at 105.55. Assuming US yields stay where they are, USD/JPY should target 107.00 in the coming sessions.\n\nThe commodity-centric Australian and New Zealand dollars both fell overnight, having been primary recipients of the global recovery rotations, along with the Canadian dollar, last week. Despite this, USD/CAD remains well below resistance at 1.2760, at 1.2700 today. Similarly, AUD/USD is trading at 0.7750, well clear of support at 0.7690. NZD/USD has fallen to 0.7200 this morning and is threatening to fall back through its symmetrical triangle at this level. It could potentially target 0.7100 initially, with the return of community Covid-19 cases in Auckland finally weighing on the Kiwi. An increase in New Zealand cases could herald the start of a deeper correction for the flightless bird.\n\nWith China on holiday until tomorrow, Asian currencies have given ground modestly overnight and this morning, although the price action looks corrective again. Indonesian Rupiah has climbed back above 14,000.00, and if US yields rise again this week, a weaker IDR could take a Friday rate cut by Bank Indonesia off the table. For the rest of the currency universe, tonight\u2019s US data, and its effect on US yields, will determine how far the US dollar correction will run.\n\nOriginal Post\n"}, {"headline": "U.S. Dollar Needs Retail Sales Comeback | Investing.com NG", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Kathy Lien", "body": ""}, {"headline": "Euro Forecast: Why Bulls Like EUR/JPY More Than EUR/USD", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/hD.CP8K5AknbE3Yvtv_VBA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/2b1579959f6ef2083a7f7d9790ce37ea", "auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "The world of FX is based on relativity, and relatively speaking, the EU is trailing other developed economies with its vaccination rates, and the EU is growing less robustly than other regions. By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "FOREX-Dollar in doldrums as vaccines fan recovery bets", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zjJP2QJtNAQrwghv2338HA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/f6990362d671426614d786ef03079407", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "The AUD/USD opens unchanged despite dovish tone in the US", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/ywf3ab9fJG68noBcHiTrnw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/1d49a6117fb098fe8a7951c5aacce76f", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "The Australian Dollar opens relatively unchanged this morning at 0.7756, down from its Friday close of 0.7760. With little to digest at home, the Aussie took direction from offshore outperforming early in the week. Initially the Aussie advanced as the Greenback's recent resurgence faltered in the face of rising inflation concerns spurred on by a potentially overzealous stimulus package. With the proposed package some 9% of GDP on top of the 4% of GDP proposed before Christmas there are concerns that inflation will take off. Despite the concerns, the 1-year inflation expectations figure failed to meet expectations and only rose to 1.21%, albeit still almost a yearly high for the report. Closer to home, Melbourne again entered a COVID-19 related lockdown, although for a proposed 5 days this time. Ultimately the news capped the Aussie's movements on Friday, although the broader market was sluggish in general due to Chinese New Year celebrations and a looming public holiday today in the US, Presidents' Day. Moving into a new week, the Aussie is set to enjoy a very quiet domestic docket initially with direction again to be driven by the Greenback.\n\nThe US dollar again took centre stage last week with the Greenback's behaviour dictating broader market movements. Spurred on first by rising treasury yields and lower than expected inflation levels, the Greenback initially consolidated against a basket of currencies but ultimately weakened as Federal Reserve head Powell and later US Treasury Secretary Yellen both displayed a dovish tone. The Greenback was also sold-off throughout the week as inflation concerns crept into the stimulus conversation. Nevertheless, the US dollar opens this morning at 90.45 on the US DXY and is up 0.16 against the Japanese yen and 0.07% against the Swiss franc.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the British pound turned out to be one of the better performers for the week after Q4 GDP rose by double market expectations at 1% q/q. Helped along by a softer Greenback and reports that the UK is starting to make headway in the infection rate, the Sterling rose an impressive 0.8% for the week and opens this morning at 1.3845.\n\nAUD/CAD: 0.9773 - 0.9920 \u25b2\n\nAUD/EUR: 0.6342 - 0.6437 \u25b2\n\nGBP/AUD: 1.7713 - 1.7980 \u25b2\n\nAUD/NZD: 1.0663 - 1.0824 \u25b2\n\nAUD/USD: 0.7701 - 0.7818 \u25b2\n"}, {"headline": "Aussie rises on solid job numbers - MarketPulse", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "MarketPulse", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/0DUnca.cpsdU3kDMXnv9sQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/1b404e3b9a223afb08fa7c408fcfa0f6", "auther": "Kenny FisherCurrency Analyst at ", "body": "The Australian dollar has reversed directions in the Wednesday session.

The reading pleased investors, as the Australian dollar has posted gains today. Although within expectations, the reading points to a worrisome trend, as Employment Change has slowed for a third successive month. Back in October, the economy created 178.8 thousand jobs, but job creation has been slipping since then. At the same time, the unemployment rate has been steadily falling and came in at 6.4%, down from 6.6%. This beat the street consensus of 6.5%.\n\nWith the Australian economy showing a V-shaped recovery from the downturn due to Covid, investors are counting on a strong rebound in Retail Sales for December (00:30 GMT). After two declines above 4%, the forecast stands at 2.1%.\n\nDespite the rosy outlook for the economy, the RBA remains very cautious. Interest rates have been pegged at a record low of 0.10%, and at the last policy meeting, the bank opted to extend its QE program until October at its February policy meeting. The minutes of that meeting indicated that the central bank deemed it necessary to stay in line with other central banks of developed markets, which have extended their QE schemes. As well, the RBA has utilized QE in an attempt to curb the appreciation of the Australian dollar, in order to ensure price stability and protect the export sector.

In doing so, the quote suspends challenges to the bulls raised by the recently published RBA minutes. The reason could be traced from the risk-on mood.\n\nWhile highlighting the importance of the extended Quantitative Easing (QE), the RBA board also mentioned about, per the Minutes, few signs of deterioration in home lending standards that would be monitored closely.\n\nRead:\u00a0RBA Minutes: \u201cVery significant\u201d monetary support to be needed for some time\n\nEven if the event matched wide market expectations, AUD/JPY traders tracked risk catalysts to the north while refreshing the highest since December 2018.\n\nWhile portraying the mood, S&P 500 Futures and Australia\u2019s ASX 200 rise 0.50% each whereas the US 10-year Treasury yields jump to the highest in 11 months by press time.\n\nBehind the moves could be the hopes of the US covid relief package and the recent positive developments over the coronavirus (COVID-19) and its vaccine. Herein Victoria\u2019s lockdown battles the optimism ahead of the mass vaccinations in Australia while the reduction in the infections in the UK and Israel after the immunization also keeps the market players hopeful. It should, however, be noted that the off in China probes the rally.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the comments from Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso as well as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, favoring the need for further easy monetary and fiscal policies, offered extra strength to the AUD/JPY moves.\n\nLooking forward, a light calendar and China\u2019s holidays will eye for fresh risk catalysts to extend the latest rally to a multi-month top.\n\nA sustained break of 82.20 becomes necessary for the bulls to eye for the September 2018 high near 82.50. However, AUD/JPY sellers are less likely to enter until witnessing a clear break below an ascending trend line from August 2020, at 81.62 now.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Australian Dollar Technical Forecast: AUD/USD, AUD/JPY, EUR/AUD", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "James Stanley", "body": "It was a forceful show of strength for the Australian currency this week as AUD hit fresh yearly-highs against the major currencies of USD, JPY and the Euro. In a backdrop where loose for longer rules the day, the hues of optimism around Australia have helped to bring buyers to the bid, driving the currency so far for much of early-2021 trade and, bigger picture, since the pandemic lows were set last March. \n\nThe pair was already on its back foot coming into 2020 trade, reeling from a combination of weakness in the Australian economy along with a general hint of risk aversion that had helped to bring upon a stronger Japanese Yen. Of course, with looming trade wars in the background, \u2018risk on\u2019 sentiment was difficult to muster at the time, and as the coronavirus began to get priced-in to markets early last year, risk aversion reared its ugly head as AUD/JPY tested below the 60.00 level for the first time since the 2008 Financial Collapse. \n\nThat test was fleeting, however, as the psychological level helped to bring buyers back to the bid; and initially, this helped to slow the sell-off. \n\nTo learn more about how psychological levels can function as support/resistance, check out DailyFX Education\n\nAs the risk trade started to return with gusto in April and May, AUD/JPY moved along with it, reversing those prior losses and beginning to show signs of strength. And that theme largely continued through the 2021 open, at which point AUD/JPY began to find resistance around another psychological level at the 80.00 handle. \n\nThis led into back-and-forth price action in January and through the February open, and when I wrote up the Analyst Pick on this setup last week, that gyration had just begun to give way on short-term charts as the inverse head and shoulders pattern that had built on long-term charts began to give way. That breakout has continued to run through this week as AUD/JPY now trades at fresh two-year-highs. \n\nTo learn more about the head and shoulders pattern, and how it can lead to breakouts check out DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDJPY on Tradingview\n\nAt this point, traders not long AUD/JPY have the complicated conundrum of trying to work with an overbought trend after a fresh breakout. And while there\u2019s been ample motive for the development of this trend, there could be pullback potential into next week, and on the four-hour chart below, I\u2019ve identified two possible areas of higher-low support that can keep the door open for bullish trend scenarios. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDJPY on Tradingview\n\nAUD/USD Drives Towards .8000 Big Fig\n\nA similar conundrum presents itself in AUD/USD where a red-hot bullish trend has moved into an overbought state, making for a challenging backdrop to those looking to continue that move. But, similarly, pullbacks could be a possible way of moving forward here, looking to institute trend trading logic after the fresh breakout; and below I look into three different areas of possible higher-low support in AUD/USD. The nearest runs from .7820-.7836, with the deeper zone showing around .7708-.7728. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDUSD on Tradingview\n\nEUR/AUD Moves Towards Long-Term Trendline \n\nWhile the Euro hasn\u2019t been as generally weak as the US Dollar or the Japanese Yen since the pandemic began, more recently, the Euro has been seeing an increasing amount of pressure. But from this week the big takeaway was just how strong the Australian Dollar was and this reflects well in the EUR/AUD chart. \n\nFrom the monthly variety below, we can see where a long-term trendline has come into play this week as the pair has pushed down to fresh two-year-lows. If EUR/AUD does hold this line of support into next week, it could make for an interesting reversal play, particularly for those that are looking to fade this recent round of Aussie strength. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/AUD on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "Rising Yields Pressure Equities, ECB Minutes On The Agenda | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y JFD Team", "body": "Equities continued to pull back yesterday and today in Asia, perhaps as rising inflation expectations continued to push bond yields higher.

This means that the reflation trade could prove to be positive for equities but only to the point where the rise in bond yields is considered too fast, which could raise speculation over monetary-policy tapering by major central banks.\n\nHowever, we believe that it is too early for something like that and the minutes from the latest FOMC meeting add credence to our view.\u00a0Yes, officials noted that PCE prices \u2013 their favorite inflation metric \u2013 were projected to move briefly above 2% in the second quarter of 2021, but this would prove to be temporary and eventually inflation is expected to finish the year at just below 2%.\n\nInflation was projected to moderate overshoot 2% for some time in the years beyond 2023, but with monetary policy assumed to remain accommodative.\u00a0Thus, with no signs of tapering any time soon, we believe that equities have the potential to rebound again, and safe havens to come under renewed selling interest.\n\nToday, the item on the agenda which could attract some special attention may be the minutes from the latest ECB policy gathering. Despite the lockdown measures around the Eurozone, at the press conference following that decision, President Lagarde said that the downside risks to the economic outlook are now \u201cless pronounced\u201d, making investors skeptical over further easing,\u00a0although the Bank repeated once again that it stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate.\u00a0Therefore, we will scan the minutes to see whether Lagarde\u2019s view is shared among other officials as well, and whether indeed the chances for more easing have lessened for now. Something like that may benefit somewhat the euro.\n\nAfter finding resistance near the 30717 barrier on Tuesday, Nikkei 225 started correcting lower. That said, the downmove might get halted, if the short-term tentative upside line, drawn from the low of Jan. 31, continues to provide support. For now, we will take a cautiously-bullish approach.\n\nAs mentioned above, if the aforementioned upside line remains intact, the bulls may take advantage of the lower price and lift it up again. That\u2019 when we will target yesterday\u2019s high, at 30585, or the 30717 barrier, marked by the current highest point of this week. Initially, Nikkei 225 might stall there for a bit, or even correct back down again. However, if the index stays above the previously-mentioned upside line, another push higher could be possible. If this time the bulls are able to overcome the 30717 hurdle, the next possible target could be at 31371, marked by the highest point of August 1990.\n\nOn the other hand, if the aforementioned upside line breaks and the index also falls below the 29660 zone, marked by the high of Feb. 12, that may open the door for further declines. Nikkei 225 may then slide to the low of Feb. 10, at 29177, a break of which could set the stage for a move to the 28720 level. That level is marked near the high of Feb. 3 and by an intraday swing low of Feb. 5.Japan's Nikkei 225 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nEUR/JPY drifted to the downside yesterday, after finding resistance near the 128.45 barrier. The pair is in slight consolidation this morning; however, it may continue its journey south for a bit more. That said, as long as the rate remains above a short-term upside support line, drawn from the low of Jan. 18, this move lower might be seen as a temporary correction only.\n\nIf the rate drifts below the 127.31 zone, marked by yesterday\u2019s low, that could send the pair towards its next potential support area, near the 126.98 hurdle, marked by the low of Feb. 12. Around there, the pair may also find support from the aforementioned upside line. EUR/JPY might get picked up by the bulls there, and if so, it could travel back up to the 127.31 obstacle, or even the 127.68 hurdle, marked by an intraday swing low of Feb. 15. If the buying doesn\u2019t stop there, the next potential target might be at 127.97, or at 128.45, which is the current highest point of February.Alternatively, if the previously-mentioned upside line breaks and the pair falls below the 126.70 hurdle, marked by the low of Feb. 11, that could also place the rate below the 200 EMA on our 4-hour chart. This may be seen as a bearish indication and more sellers could join in. EUR/JPY might then drift to the 126.43 obstacle, a break of which may clear the path to the 126.10 level. That level is marked by the current lowest point of February.EUR/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nThe US building permits and housing starts for\u00a0January are\u00a0coming out, and they are both expected to have declined somewhat from their December readings.\u00a0We also get the initial jobless claims for last week, with the forecast pointing to a small decline, to 765k from 793k the week before.\n\nWith regards to the energy market, we get the EIA (Energy Information Administration) report on crude oil inventories for last week, with the forecast pointing to a 2.429mn barrels decline following a 6.644mn fall the week before.\u00a0Yesterday, the API reported a 5.800mn barrels slide and thus, we would consider the risks surrounding the EIA forecast as tilted to the downside. Combined with the ongoing deep freeze in Texas, this is likely to boost oil prices even further.\n\nTonight, during the Asian morning Friday, Japan\u2019s National CPIs for January are due to be released.

It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD Vs USD/JPY and the FX Cross Pair Divide", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/rNkBPK9aa9Jmz49Ee7qjAg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/1bc8588b51831e795c1f03b377aa14d3", "auther": "Brian Twomey", "body": "Overall currency markets are in the great deadlock between natural opposites EUR/USD and USD/JPY.

But for how long will they be prepared to stay accommodative if inflation climbs above the 2% level?\n\nThe minutes later on Wednesday from the U.S Federal Reserve's January meeting will be closely watched for clues as to when the central bank will move.\n\n\u201cU.S. CPI inflation also disappointed a touch in January, which may have soothed some inflation fears. This will however all change in a couple of months\u2019 time,\u201d said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. \u201cIndeed, we expect the current inflation breeze to strengthen into gale force winds by the second quarter, at least in terms of the market\u2019s narrative.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3878, weighed by the support for the dollar, even as\u00a0U.K. inflation accelerated in January, with consumer prices increasing 0.7% from a year earlier, slightly up from 0.6% in December, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday.\n\nIt leaves inflation well below the 2% level targeted by the Bank of England, which has cut interest rates and expanded its bond-buying program in response to the economic damage caused by pandemic.\n"}]}, {"id": "AUD/NZD",

"auther": "Thomas Westwater", "body": "US equities moved higher last week as investors continued to bet on the global economic recovery, boosted by increased Covid vaccination rollouts, loose monetary conditions, and ongoing fiscal support. The small-cap Russell 2000 index gave the most impressive showing of the major ones, with a 2.51% weekly gain. A more notable development, however, is the collapse in volatility seen in the US markets, reflected by the CBOE S&P 500 Volatility Index (VIX) closing below 20, the lowest level since February 2020. \n\nThe collapse in volatility via the VIX \u2013 which is widely used as a \u201cfear gauge\u201d \u2013 follows a strong corporate earnings season. So far, financial results from S&P 500 companies have largely beat analysts\u2019 expectations. The week ahead will see another round of quarterly results cross the wires, with the commerce juggernaut Walmart scheduled to release its figures on Thursday. Still, even with upbeat earnings, some investors are blowing the horn over stretched valuations.\n\nStocks may have more fuel to continue running higher despite high valuations amid the ongoing support seen from central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve. In a speech to The Economic Club of New York last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell once again ensured investors that supportive conditions are here to stay for the time being. Long-dated Treasury yields ended the week higher, with the 30-year yield climbing above 2.0%, the loftiest mark since early 2020. \n\nData Source: BBG\n\nMonday, along with the entire upcoming week, will likely be a quiet one across the APAC region. Exchanges are closed in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea as traders and investors celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday. Foreign exchange volumes may also see less activity, which could possibly also translate to lower volatility across many currency pairs. Having said that, breaking headlines that could drive markets quickly risk being more volatile due to reduced levels of liquidity.\n\nConsequently, this week\u2019s economic events calendar is also lighter than usual but the front end of the week may see the New Zealand Dollar react to BusinessNZ\u2019s Performance of Services Index (PSI) report, set to cross the wires early Monday morning, according to the DailyFX Economic Calendar. Japan will also release its Q4 GDP data, with analysts expecting a 9.5% annualized increase, down from 22.9% in the previous quarter. \n\nDespite the holiday break and light economic data prints for the week ahead, AUD/NZD presents an interesting technical setup that may give way to actionable movement. The 23.6% Fibonacci retracement from the Dec \u2013 Jan move appears to have interrupted last week\u2019s rally. However, the immediate path higher appears poised for further upside. \n\nThat upside may soon find significant resistance, however. The 20- and 50-day Simple Moving Averages appear to be on course to complete a bearish cross this week, which could dent AUD sentiment and hinder further gains. Moreover, a trendline from the August swing high also poses a test for bulls. Granted that, the MACD points to near-term upside, with a bullish cross above its centerline on the cards in the coming days. \n\nChart created with TradingView\n\n--- Written by Thomas Westwater, Analyst for DailyFX.com\n\nTo contact Thomas, use the comments section below or @FxWestwateron Twitter\n"}, {"headline": "US Dollar Price Action Setups: AUD/USD, DXY, NZD/USD, USD/CAD", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/7my6vELlhsolWkp4HPp58g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/063085c9015523ec17ebca884f284d8c", "auther": "Daniel Moss", "body": "As mentioned in previous report, the haven-associated US Dollar may continue to lose ground against its major counterparts, as long-term price analysis suggests a cyclical downturn is in the offing. \n\nDXY monthly chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe chart above highlights the cyclical pattern seen in the US Dollar Index over the past 34 years, with the DXY largely adhering to what appears to be a 16-year rotation. The index set significant bottoms in 1992 and 2008. \n\nAfter bottoming out, price then seems to rebound aggressively early in the cycle, soaring 24.1% and 26.8% in 1993 and 2009 respectively, before pulling back to key support at the 88.6% Fibonacci. A 6-year period of sustained USD strength follows this counter-trend pullback, with price climbing 50.1% from the 1995 low and 42.8% from the 2011 low, to set key highs in 2001 and 2017. \n\nBearish RSI divergence in late 2002 seemed to signal the end of the US Dollar\u2019s bull run and triggered a shift in overall market sentiment, as price collapsed through uptrend support and ell 41.6% to eventually bottom in March 2008. \n\nRecent price action and the development of the RSI is strikingly similar to that seen in the first quarter of 2003 and could be indicative of further downside for the DXY, as price slices through the September 2020 low (91.75) and hurtles towards the 2018 low (88.25). \n\nAn extended downside push towards the 100% Fibonacci expansion (83.50) looks likely if the 2018 low is breached, with cycle analysis suggesting price could fall a further 23% from current levels before bottoming out in mid-2024. \n\nAUD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nThe longer-term technical outlook for AUD/USD remains overtly bullish, as price surges above the August 2020 high (0.7413) to challenge the psychologically imposing 0.7800 mark. \n\nWith the MACD hovering at its highest levels since 2011, and the RSI eyeing a push into overbought territory, the path of least resistance seems higher. \n\nA bullish \u2018golden cross\u2019 moving average formation also hints at extended gains for the exchange rate in the coming months. \n\nA weekly close above 0.7810 is required to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and clear a path for price to challenge the 2018 high (0.8136). Hurdling that likely brings the 100% Fibonacci (0.8918) into the crosshairs. \n\nHowever, if 0.7800 successfully stifles buying pressure, a short-term pullback to the yearly low (0.7564) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 38.14% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.62 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 20.49% higher than yesterday and 0.10% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 10.93% higher than yesterday and 13.40% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests AUD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is less net-short than yesterday but more net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed AUD/USD trading bias.\n\nNZD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nNZD/USD rates also seem poised to continue pushing higher, as price storms away from the support range at 0.7100 \u2013 0.7130. \n\nThe development of the RSI hints at swelling bullish momentum, as the oscillator continues to track the uptrend extending from the March lows and eyes an entry into overbought territory.\n\nA weekly close above 0.7250 likely paves the way for buyers to drive the exchange rate towards the 61.8% Fibonacci (0.7333). Breaching that opens to door for a challenge of the 2017 high (0.7558). \n\nConversely, failing to break above the psychologically imposing 0.7300 mark could allow sellers to force NZD/USD back towards the yearly low (0.7096). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 39.33% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.54 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 15.38% higher than yesterday and 17.10% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 9.95% higher than yesterday and 2.21% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests NZD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current NZD/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nUSD/CAD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nUSD/CAD looks set to extend recent losses, as price continues to track within the confines of a Descending Channel. \n\nA \u2018death cross\u2019 moving average formation, in combination with the RSI dipping to its lowest levels since 2017, suggests the path of least resistance is lower. \n\nPiercing range support at 1.2555 \u2013 1.2590 likely intensifies selling pressure and clears a path for price to challenge the 2018 low (1.2247). \n\nHowever, if support remains intact, a rebound back towards channel resistance and the 21-EMA could be in the offing (1.2599). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 72.92% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.69 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 11.33% higher than yesterday and 8.63% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 37.76% higher than yesterday and 19.61% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests USD/CAD prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is less net-long than yesterday but more net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed USD/CAD trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "GBP, AUD End Week Near 3-Year Highs | Investing.com PH", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Kathy Lien", "body": "USD Sells Off Despite Stronger PMIs\n\nGBP Breaks 1.40 On Stronger PMIs\n\nAUD Shrugs Off Weaker Retail Sales\n\nNZD, AUD Hit Highest Levels Since March 2018\n\nEUR Rally Supported By Rise In PMI\n\nCAD Unfazed By Weaker Retail Sales\n\nThere were some big moves in currencies on Friday, which was no surprise given the busy economic calendar.

Next week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell will delivery his semi-annual testimony on the economy and monetary policy. He\u2019s made it clear that no rate hikes are on the horizon and it is too soon to consider tapering asset purchases. At the same time, he\u2019s optimistic about the recovery, and expects stronger growth in the second half of the year. The combination of a positive outlook and policy accommodation is good for stocks, high-beta currencies and bad for the U.S. dollar. This week\u2019s moves could be a reflection of investors positioning for the Fed\u2019s optimism.Sterling was not the day\u2019s strongest performer (that title goes to the Australian and New Zealand dollars) but the move above 1.40 is significant. Retail sales\u00a0were terrible. Consumer spending dropped 8.2% in the month of January, three times more than expected. However, sterling bulls were unfazed by this release, choosing instead to focus on stronger PMIs. Manufacturing and service sector activity improved in February, which drove the composite rate up to 49.8 from 41.2. This is significantly stronger than the 42.2 forecast. The PMIs are more forward-looking than retail sales, but consumer spending needs to recover to keep pace with manufacturing activity otherwise manufacturing will have to slow.The return of Chinese investors drove the Australian and New Zealand dollars to fresh multi-year highs.\u00a0Both currencies rose more than 1% against the greenback intraday and the breakout after a period of consolidation in AUD/USD and NZD/USD could lead to further gains in the coming week. Australian and New Zealand data was actually disappointing, with very little producer price growth in New Zealand in the fourth quarter. In Australia, manufacturing activity slowed, while retail sales growth missed expectations. These reports would normally drive AUD/USD lower, but investors are laser focused on recovery. Virus cases are extremely low in both countries and New Zealand just lifted its three-day lockdown. The Canadian dollar also shrugged off weaker retail sales. Consumer spending dropped 3.4% at the end of last year, which was worse than the -2.5% forecast.The\u00a0euro trailed behind GBP, AUD and NZD but Eurozone's economic reports were the most encouraging.\u00a0The composite PMI index increased in the month of February thanks to stronger manufacturing activity in Germany and the Eurozone. Services continued to contract, but the strong expansion in manufacturing more than made up the difference. According to the producer price report, inflationary pressures in the Germany increased at the start of the year. With that said, the gains in EUR/USD were modest as the pair hovers underneath the 50-day SMA.\n"}, {"headline": "NZD/AUD \u2013 Battle Of The Interest Rates", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/vJgTB6LVqi16Y.Ak0KZqWA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/8d0d66de7297331639c2d32cede084d0", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "NZD/AUD is approaching a robust congested area at around 0.925. A downwards channel sees a possible move further lower may see the pair come a level below 0.9. However, an action lower will be dictated on which economy puts the brakes on monetary stimulus first.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDuring the peak of the Coronavirus, the best method of suppressing the virus was not evident. This is where Australia and New Zealand\u2019s strategies diverged.\n\nAustralia went for a loose lockdown, allowing citizens to roam freely without restricting them to their houses. They did enforce social distancing laws alongside mask-wearing.\n\nNew Zealand went for a strict lockdown, only allowing citizens to leave their house to exercise, get groceries and go to the doctors. Essential workers were given a pass to go to work.\n\nIt became evident as to what method was more successful. There were critics initially questioning New Zealand\u2019s method, pointing to the likes of Australia and Japan, who were getting similar results to New Zealand per capita, however, without the devastating economic cost of a lockdown. Those critics were soon to be silenced after New Zealand slowly pulled out their nearly six-week lockdown, well on their way to recovery. On the other hand, Australia had a devastating second wave that forced the inevitable \u2013 a strict lockdown. However, by then, New Zealand was back open and running.\n\nWith a head start in Australia\u2019s economic recovery, New Zealand has been showing signs of slowing its fiscal and monetary policy measures. Recently, The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) re-instated policies regarding mortgages issued by banks, which require house investors to front up 40% of the house sale price if they want to purchase a house. These were temporarily removed during the peak of the Coronavirus in 2020 to stimulate the economy. However, they were placed back after the national median price jumped up to $730,000, up 19.3%.\n\nHowever, a country that is heavily dependant on tourism is struggling due to the strict border controls. Westpac analysts predict New Zealand\u2019s GDP to fall 0.7 over the six months to March due to the lack of tourists. Dominick Stephens stated that \u201ctourism is highly seasonal, and there is normally a strong net inflow of people into the country in the summer months. The absence of visitors was felt keenly in the December quarter, and will be even more so in the March quarter, which would have otherwise been the peak tourist season.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAustralia has not had a good time dealing with the Coronavirus. Outsourcing security of their quarantine to a private company did not end well, with the spread of the virus being exacerbated by the security guards sleeping with the Coronavirus guests. This, alongside lax state line restrictions, pushed Coronavirus cases up, forcing two lockdowns. However, there is some optimism in the Australian economy, with many of their commodities\u2019 prices reaching all-time highs. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank of Australia stating that the \u201crecovery in the second half of 2020 had been faster than initially expected.\u201d\n\nI believe the economy that starts tapering monetary policy programs will first see their currency strengthen against the other. With the RBA stating that they are \u201ccommitted to doing what it reasonably could to support the Australian economy\u201d and that \u201csignificant monetary support would be required for some time,\u201d it looks like New Zealand in the mid to long term will be raising rates before Australia will, given the actions they took with loan-to-value ratios, alongside the consistent recovery from the Coronavirus.\n"}, {"headline": "NZD/USD conquers 0.7300 level, eyes test of 2021 highs", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/oJ3hSBzhJKx6j9_X3vRuuA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/24ccc2331db8970621bf326716dd4a22", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "NZD/USD has been firmly on the front foot since the start of Friday\u2019s European trading session, rallying from Asia Pacific levels of just above the 0.7200 mark to now above 0.7300. The pair is thus within striking distance of the 2021 high set right at the start of January of just shy of the 0.7320 level. With gains of roughly 1.2% versus this US dollar, Friday is shaping up to be the kiwi\u2019s best since 9 October 2020.\n\nOn the week, the currency is now\u00a0vying for first place in the G10 ranking with GBP and AUD, all trading with weekly gains versus the US dollar of between 1.2-1.4%. On the month, NZD is the third-best performer after GBP and AUD, up about 2% versus USD.\n\nThe kiwi currently sits atop the G10 FX performance table, though specific news or events can be definitively pointed at as supporting the currency. For what its worth, Q4 PPI data released during Friday\u2019s Asia Pacific session did not appear to influence the price action much; input prices were unchanged in the quarter, down from growth of 0.6% in Q3, whilst Output price growth accelerated to 0.4% from its -0.3% contraction in Q3.\n\nMarkets have been in a generally risk-on mood on Friday and this is supporting risk-sensitive currencies such as NZD; stock markets are yet to take the recent run higher in global bond yields as a negative and the S&P 500 continues to trade comfortably above the 3900 level, not far from recent record levels. US President Joe Biden is expected to say that the US is not looking for a new cold war with China at the G7 summit, constructive commentary that may ease some concerns about the potential for relations to further deteriorate. Biden is still expected to call for democracies to challenge the country\u2019s abusive practises, however. Meanwhile, preliminary Markit PMI data for February out of Australia, the UK and US were decent, implying that the recovery in these countries remains on track as global vaccine rollouts continue. On which note, vaccine appears to lower Covid-19 infections and transmission rates by two-thirds, according to the Telegraph citing data set to be released later this month by Public Health England.\n\nWhilst the above is all very well and good for the kiwi, support also appears to be coming from movements in Australia and New Zealand\u2019s bond markets; yields in the former have surged since the start of the European session, with Australian 10-year bond yields currently up more than 7bps on the day at close to 1.49% following a change to Westpac\u2019s year-end bond yield forecast (which was revised higher to 1.9% from 1.5%. When New Zealand\u2019s bond markets re-open on Monday, similar upside is likely to be seen in bond yields there. That means the country\u2019s 10-year yield could be substantially higher than its Friday closing level at 1.517%, which was already amongst the highest yielding developed market 10-year notes.\n\nNZD/USD four hour chart\n\n\n"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD and NZD/USD Fundamental Daily Forecast \u2013 Down Sharply as Jump in Treasury Yields Boosts...", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/hrbsSxK3mzmJOAR9SyLF0w--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/522cb6efab888fa6b63ed9bc25953865", "auther": "James Hyerczyk", "body": "The Australian and New Zealand Dollars are taking a hit on Wednesday, falling from multi-week highs reached earlier in the week, as a jump in Treasury yields gave the U.S. Dollar a reprieve, while domestic bonds took a beating amid fears of faster global inflation.\n\nAt 11:39 GMT, the AUD/USD is trading .7743, down 0.0013 or -0.17% and the NZD/USD is at .7184, down 0.0025 or -0.35%.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar was benefiting from rising yields; it was not alone.

However, in light of the recent run of stronger than expected economic data, the focus will be on the RBNZ\u2019s updated forecasts as well as Governor Or\u2019s presser.  \n\nAt the last meeting, the RBNZ provided a hawkish surprise given that the NZ economy had performed significantly better than the central bank\u2019s pessimistic forecasts, which in turn saw a sharp re-pricing of negative rates in the front end of the curve and subsequently prompted a sizeable bid in the Kiwi. Since the November meeting, it appears as if the RBNZ has once again underestimated the recovery in the NZ economy as domestic data has outperformed the RBNZ\u2019s forecasts. Q4 CPI printed 0.3ppts higher than the RBNZ had assumed at 0.5% Q/Q and 1.4% Y/Y, the bounce back in Q3 growth had been firmer than expected at 14% (vs 13.4%) and the unemployment rate saw a sizeable drop to 4.9%, which had been 0.7ppts below the RBNZ\u2019s estimate.\n\nSource: DailyFX\n\nNot only that, but the global economy also looks to be in better shape with vaccine programs underway, while a democratic sweep has raised the prospect of a larger US fiscal stimulus package. In turn, the central bank will likely acknowledge this growth outperformance and thus forecast a quicker return to pre-COVID levels than previously expected, subsequently, reducing the need for further monetary stimulus.\n\nHowever, a cause of concern for the RBNZ\u2019s inflation outlook will be the Kiwi\u2019s strength on a trade-weighted basis, which currently hovers at multi-year highs at 74.55, and is notably higher than the RBNZ\u2019s forecast of 71.5. In turn, risks remain for RBNZ jawboning, which could come in the form of extending LSAPs beyond Mid-2022, much like the RBA. That said, while this would place initial pressure on the Kiwi, downside would likely be short-lived. \n\nOverall, the outlook remains positive for the NZD, which continues to ride the reflation theme, this also looks to be reflected in positioning data as speculators remain long NZD. However, this could suggest that upside against the USD in the short run could be somewhat limited, given that a lot of good news has been priced in. \n\nIn turn, my focus is on AUD/NZD, which has bounced back to 1.08 despite the RBA\u2019s best efforts to keep pressure on the Aussie. The cross currently trades at rich levels relative to spreads and while the RBNZ has the proclivity to surprise, it is unlikely that the RBNZ will match the dovish stance of the RBA. Another factor that has also garnered attention in recent sessions is US-Sino tensions resurfacing, in which AUD has a higher beta relative to NZD. With that in mind, I would prefer to fade the strength in AUD/NZD from 1.08, looking for a move back to 1.06. \n\nAUD/NZD vs 10yr Spreads\n\nSource: Refinitiv\n\nHawkish vs Dovish: How Monetary Policy Affects FX Trading\n"}, {"headline": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares hit new peaks, oil up on Middle East tensions By Reuters", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/B5u2AkuWjl5fVCy3o8yKrA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/7262e1f0414aabef5f9d57b2b2891d2a", "auther": "Stock ", "body": "(Adds European futures, updates levels throughout)* Asian stock markets : https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4* MSCI Asia ex-Japan hits record high, Nikkei climbs* Oil prices at highest since January 2020* Risk appetite higher on virus vaccine rollout, U.S.stimulus* Currency market action muted; Bitcoin comes off recordhighsBy Swati PandeySYDNEY, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Asian shares advanced to recordhighs on Monday as successful coronavirus vaccine rolloutsglobally raise hopes of a rapid economic recovery amid newfiscal aid from Washington, while oil prices rose on heightenedtensions in the Middle East.The signals for Europe and the United States were positivetoo, with futures for eurostoxx 50 STXEc1 up 0.5%, those forGermany's DAX FDXc1 rising 0.7% and London's FTSE futuresFFIc1 climbing 0.8%.

That being said, the next big target will be the 0.80 level, an area that of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and would attract quite a bit of attention.\n\nWith that being said, I believe that what we are seeing here is an expression of the commodity trade, and the fact that copper markets had gained 3% early in trading. That is a major export of Australia, and recently we have seen some of the major companies in Australia report Blockbuster earnings due to iron sales in China.\n\nIn other words, the commodity trade is \u201cfull on\u201d and people are looking to get exposure one way or the other. The Australian dollar of course is highly sensitive to all of these markets, and therefore it makes perfect sense that we would continue to see people interested in this market. For what it is worth, we have just broken above the top of the flag that measures for a potential move all the way to the 0.86, although I do think that the area 0.80 is going to take a lot of effort to get through.\n\nIn other words, we will more than likely be positive, but I suspect we will also be very choppy at one point or another. I anticipate that the market will probably behave at the 0.80 level the same way it did at 0.78 over the last month.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Testing 200 Day EMA \n-  EUR/USD Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Euro Finds Support at Crucial Level \n-  Natural Gas Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Natural Gas Markets Give Up Gains \n-  Oil Price Fundamental Daily Forecast \u2013 Lighter Refinery Demand Expectations Weighing on Prices \n-  Gold Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Gold Markets Pull Back to Test Support \n-  EUR/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Euro Runs Into Overhead Resistance \n"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Resistance At 0.7800 Stays Strong", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.0Uz9M.JYfMy4mAB1Z3mmw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/8c2fd961a929b191f5dbe5d6d0810be3", "auther": "Vladimir Zernov", "body": "AUD/USD Video 16.02.21.\n\nAUD/USD made an attempt to settle above the resistance level at 0.7800 but lost momentum while the U.S. dollar remained under pressure against a broad basket of currencies.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index has recently made another attempt to settle below the nearest support level at 90.30 but failed to develop downside momentum. Currently, U.S. Dollar Index remains stuck in the range between the support at 90.30 and the resistance at 90.50. A move above the resistance at 90.50 will push the U.S. Dollar Index towards the 20 EMA at 90.60 which will be bearish for AUD/USD.\n\nToday, foreign exchange market traders will likely keep a close eye on the latest developments in the oil market. The recent rally provided material support to commodity-related currencies, including Australian dollar.\n\nHowever, oil looks overbought, and the risks of a pullback are increasing. If WTI oil settles below the psychologically important $60 level, it will gain downside momentum which will be bearish for the Australian dollar.\n\nAUD/USD failed to settle above the resistance level at 0.7800 and declined towards the support at 0.7780. Currently, AUD/USD is trying to settle below this support level.\n\nIf this attempt is successful, AUD/USD will move towards the next support which is located at 0.7760. A move below this level will open the way to the test of the support at 0.7740. In case AUD/USD declines below the support at 0.7740, it will head towards the next support at 0.7725.\n\nOn the upside, AUD/USD needs to stay above the support level at 0.7780 to have a chance to develop upside momentum in the near term. If AUD/USD manages to stay above this level, it will get to another test of the resistance at 0.7800. AUD/USD will likely have better chances to settle above this level on the second attempt.\n\nIf AUD/USD settles above the resistance at 0.7800, it will head towards the next resistance level at yearly highs at 0.7820.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Slight Shift in Momentum Indicates Sellers Gaining Control \n-  Sterling Clocks Fresh Multi-Month Peaks Vs.

New claims totaled 861,000, the highest level in a month and above the Dow Jones estimate of 773,000 the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nYields on Australian 10-year bonds have surged 19 basis points this week, the biggest jump since last June, to reach an 11-month high of 1.425%.\n\nAdditionally, the Aussie was supported by rising commodity prices as China returned from holiday, with copper the highest in eight years and tin at a nine-year peak. Iron ore, Australia\u2019s single biggest export earner, surged above $170 a tonne and is delivering a windfall to mining profit and government tax revenue.\n\nAt 03:36 GMT, the AUD/USD is trading .7763, down 0.0007 or -0.10%.\n\nThe main trend is up according to the daily swing chart, however, momentum has been trending lower since the formation of the closing price reversal top on Tuesday and its subsequent confirmation the next session.\n\nA trade through .7805 will negate the closing price reversal top and signal a resumption of the uptrend. The main trend will change to down on a move through .7564. This is highly unlikely but there is room to the downside for a normal 50% to 61.8% correction.\n\nThe minor range is .7805 to .7724. The AUD/USD is currently straddling its 50% level at .7764.\n\nThe short-term range is .7820 to .7564. The AUD/USD is currently trading on the strong side of its retracement zone at .7722 to .7692.\n\nThe next short-term range is .7564 to .7805. Its 50% level at .7685 is another potential downside target.\n\nThe early price action suggests the direction of the AUD/USD on Friday will be determined by trader reaction to .7764.\n\nA sustained move under .7764 will indicate the presence of sellers. If this move creates enough downside momentum then look for a break into .7724 \u2013 .7722. If the latter fails as support then look for the selling to possibly extend into .7713, followed closely by .7692.\n\nA sustained move over .7765 will signal the presence of buyers. If this generates enough upside momentum then look for a test of this week\u2019s high at .7805. Taking out this level will reaffirm the main trend. This could lead to a test of the high for the year at .7820.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  U.S. Market Wrap and Forecast for Friday \n-  The Crypto Daily \u2013 Movers and Shakers \u2013 February 19th, 2021 \n-  Roku Tops Q4 Earnings Estimates; Provides Upbeat Guidance \n-  U.S. Dollar Index (DX) Futures Technical Analysis \u2013 Trader Reaction to 90.575 Pivot Sets Near-Term Tone \n-  Is Ethereum about to embark on a large correction back to around $1300? \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Trader Reaction to .7764 Pivot Sets the Early Tone \n"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Australian Dollar Moves Higher Against U.S. Dollar", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/tftdLo4x0kMeGB3ny2DDow--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/b1c7e3dd753c6b7c19b97d15798c948b", "auther": "Vladimir Zernov", "body": "AUD/USD Video 18.02.21.\n\nAUD/USD is currently trying to settle back above the resistance at 0.7760 while the U.S. dollar is losing some ground against a broad basket of currencies.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index has recently managed to get below the nearest support level at 90.90 and is trying to gain additional downside momentum. The next support level for the U.S. Dollar Index is located at the 50 EMA at 90.80. If the U.S. Dollar Index declines below this level, it will head towards the next support at the 20 EMA at 90.65 which will be bullish for AUD/USD.\n\nToday, Australia reported that Unemployment Rate declined from 6.6% in December to 6.4% in January while analysts expected that it would decrease to 6.5%. Meanwhile, Employment Change report indicated that employment increased by 29,100 people compared to analyst consensus of 40,000. The employment data indicates that the Australian economy continues to rebound thanks to the country\u2019s success in containing coronavirus.\n\nForeign exchange market traders will also have a chance to take a look at U.S. employment data. Initial Jobless Claims are expected to decline from 793,000 to 765,000 while Continuing Jobless Claims are projected to decrease from 4.54 million to 4.41 million.\n\nAUD/USD managed to settle above 0.7740 and is trying to settle above the resistance at 0.7760. If this attempt is successful, AUD/USD will move towards the next resistance level at 0.7780.\n\nA successful test of the resistance at 0.7780 will open the way to the test of the next resistance which is located at 0.7800. In case AUD/USD gets above the resistance at 0.7800, it will head towards the resistance at the yearly highs at 0.7820.\n\nOn the support side, the nearest support level for AUD/USD is located at 0.7740. If AUD/USD gets below this level, it will move towards the next support level near the 20 EMA at 0.7725. A move below the 20 EMA will push AUD/USD towards the support at 0.7700.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  Crude Oil Bulls hold Ace High, on Prevailing Bullish Dynamics in Play \n-  3 Silver Stocks with a Shiny Outlook \n-  February 18th 2021: Greenback Extends Gains Amidst Upbeat Economic Data \n-  GBP/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Support At 1.3835 In Sight \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 WTI Jumps after API Report with Sights Set on $62.64 \n-  EUR/USD Vs USD/JPY and the FX Cross Pair Divide \n"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD and NZD/USD Fundamental Daily Forecast \u2013 Down Sharply as Jump in Treasury Yields Boosts...", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/hrbsSxK3mzmJOAR9SyLF0w--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/522cb6efab888fa6b63ed9bc25953865", "auther": "James Hyerczyk", "body": "The Australian and New Zealand Dollars are taking a hit on Wednesday, falling from multi-week highs reached earlier in the week, as a jump in Treasury yields gave the U.S. Dollar a reprieve, while domestic bonds took a beating amid fears of faster global inflation.\n\nAt 11:39 GMT, the AUD/USD is trading .7743, down 0.0013 or -0.17% and the NZD/USD is at .7184, down 0.0025 or -0.35%.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar was benefiting from rising yields; it was not alone. Australian 10-year yields climbed even more to hit 1.421%, the highest since a brief spike during the market mayhem of last March according to Reuters. Yields were up 20 basis points in just two days and widened the spread over Treasuries to 10 basis points, from 2 basis points late last week.\n\nThree-year yields remained pinned at 0.129% thanks to the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) continued commitment to super-easy policy, Reuters reported.\n\nThe spread between three- and 10-year yields widened to 129 basis points, the steepest curve since early 2014 and a potential boon at bank earnings.\n\nIn New Zealand, 10-year yields shot to 1.558% having risen 18 basis points on Tuesday alone.\n\nIn other news, investors are reconsidering how long the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will maintain its stimulus package given the economy has rebounded and house prices are booming.\n\nThe central bank holds its first policy meeting of the year next week and investors assume it will keep rates at 0.25% but acknowledge the better economic background.\n\n\u201cThe RBNZ might talk less about looming downside risks, and will probably not actively promote the possibility of further rate cuts, as it did over most of last year,\u201d said Dominick Stephens, Westpac\u2019s chief economist for NZ.\n\nHe expects the RBNZ will not start to hike rates until 2024, but could tinker with its bond buying program next week, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cIt seems a lot like the RBNZ has decided to slow the pace of bond purchases and allow long-term interest rates to rise, even though no such policy decision has been announced,\u201d said Stephens.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields are edging lower on Wednesday, but remained near multi-month highs, amid concerns about possible rising inflation.\n\nData for retail sales in the U.S. in January is due out at 13:30 GMT on Wednesday. Economists expect retail sales rose by 1.2% after a surprise 0.7% decline in December, according to Dow Jones.\n\nMinutes from the last meeting of the U.S. central bank\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee are due to be published at 19:00 GMT.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our\u00a0economic calendar. \n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  Why Verizon Shares Are Rallying Today? \n-  Stocks Mixed As Retail Sales\u2019 Growth Pushes Treasury Yields Higher \n-  U.S. Hotel Operator Hilton Posts Surprise Q4 Loss, Shares Fall \n-  AUD/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Australian Dollar Tries To Rebound \n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Continues to Push Higher Against Yen \n-  European Supranationals Outlook: Path Clears for Euro-Denominated Green and Social Safe Assets \n"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into...", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/86VZpAeu4cGVbVso2td9Tw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/2b4503ae6bd3433a7552bffe35085217", "auther": "James Hyerczyk", "body": "The Australian Dollar is trading near a three-year high on optimism about an economic rebound in the country and as the U.S. Dollar continued to be pressured by Thursday\u2019s disappointing weekly initial claims report.\n\nThe Aussie is trading at its highest level since March 2018. The currency, which is closely linked to commodity prices and the outlook for global growth, has been helped by a recent rally in commodity prices.\n\nAt 13:56 GMT, the AUD/USD is trading .7863, up 0.0093 or +1.20%.\n\nThe U.S. currency had been rising in recent days as a jump in Treasury yields on the back of the so-called reflation trade drew investors. But an unexpected increase in U.S. weekly jobless claims soured the economic outlook and sent the dollar lower overnight.\n\nLater today at 14:45 GMT, investors will get the opportunity to react to the latest U.S. data on Flash Manufacturing PMI and Flash Services PMI. Both are expected to remain in expansion territory, but may nudge lower than the previous month.\n\nThe main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. The uptrend was reaffirmed earlier today when buyers took out a pair of main tops at .7805 and the high for the year at .7820. The main trend will change to down on a move through .7724.\n\nLook for an upside bias on Friday as long as the AUD/USD can hold above yesterday\u2019s close at .7770. Finishing below this level will form a potentially bearish closing price reversal top that could trigger the start of a 2 to 3 day correction.\n\nThe nearest upside target is the March 14, 2018 main top at .7916.\n\nFalling below .7820 will be the first sign of weakness, while a drop below .7805 will indicate the buying is weakening and the selling is getting stronger.

As I write this, the best-known and most-valuable cryptocurrency trades above $47,000, down modestly from an all-time high set on Thursday morning.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBitcoin now has roughly tripled since November, and rallied more than 50% this year. And the optimism makes some sense.\n\nNotably, corporations are increasingly comfortable with adopting Bitcoin. BTC saw a big catalyst this week when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said it would buy $1.5 billion of the crypto. The electric vehicle giant follows earlier adopters like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and payment companies Square (NYSE:SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe run over the last four months continues what has been an incredible rally. Bitcoin only launched in 2009. It cleared $1 (yes, one dollar) for the first time almost exactly a decade ago. Give or take, BTC has appreciated 4,700,000% in ten years. There have been few assets in the history of mankind to show that kind of appreciation. Simply put, Bitcoin has created millionaires.\n\nBut the rally hasn\u2019t been without volatility. In fact, volatility and crashes both have been a key part of the Bitcoin experience. Many of those crashes started in environments similar to this one: when all seemed well, and further upside appeared almost guaranteed.\n\nThat history suggests another reversal is almost certain to occur. That doesn\u2019t mean investors need to rush to sell their BTC immediately, but at the least they should be on their guard.\n\nFor skeptics (and I remain one of them), early 2021 looks an awful lot like late 2017.\n-  9 Meme Stocks That Social Media Won't Shut Up About \n\nAt that time, Bitcoin similarly was soaring. Bitcoin cleared $1,000 on New Year\u2019s Day 2017. By December, it was over $18,000. $20,000 and beyond seemed guaranteed. Cryptos of all kinds were rallying. Initial coin offerings were all the rage.\n\nBut as good as 2017 was, 2018 was nearly as bad. In U.S. dollars, Bitcoin had been halved by February. By the end of 2018, it was back below $4,000.\n\nAs an article at the time noted, the 2018 decline was not the first huge drawdown the cryptocurrency had seen. Not even close. In 2012, BTC dropped 49% twice, with one of the declines a three-day, 57% punishment. Another three-day period the following year saw an incredible 83% plunge.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2013, BTC lost half its value. Later that month, it began a stretch of over a year in which it went from $1,163 to just $152.40.\n\nEven in 2017, a banner year, Bitcoin fell 30% or more five different times. And then there was the roughly 80% plunge that began toward the end of that year.\n\nAdmittedly, of late the volatility has eased somewhat relative to early trading. Wider adoption and a larger investor base should continue that moderation going forward.\n\nStill, we\u2019ve seen this before. Bitcoin can move north in a hurry, but it also can move, and has moved, south at roughly the same pace.\n\nAnd there are a pair of catalysts that could trigger another decline in 2021.\n\nThe first is simply the parabolic gains not just in BTC, but across asset classes. We\u2019ve seen a number of stocks go crazy. That doesn\u2019t just include miners like Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Marathon Patent (NASDAQ:MARA). It even goes beyond the so-called \u201cReddit stocks\u201d like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).\n\nCommodities have taken off. Even in cryptos, DogeCoin, which started as a joke, now has a market capitalization of $9 billion.\n\nThere are going to be crashes elsewhere, whether in cryptos, stocks, or commodities. And those crashes may well read across to Bitcoin. Surely there is cross-ownership between Bitcoin and other \u2018hot\u2019 assets. Those owners that see losses elsewhere are likely to de-risk by converting BTC to USD.\n\nThere\u2019s also the regulatory environment. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has repeatedly and publicly raised concerns about cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin.\n\nCertainly, Yellen can\u2019t ban BTC trading and send its value to zero. But she can impact potentially bullish catalysts, like the long-awaited launch of an exchange-traded fund (which would need to be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission).\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the possibility that Bitcoin itself simply has run too far. It stands to reason that at least some of the incremental buyers since December are not diehard crypto adherents, who believe Bitcoin can disintermediate large financial institutions. They\u2019re just joining in the fun.\n\nIn modern trader parlance, there may be some \u201cweak hands\u201d that have jumped on board. They\u2019re not necessarily the type to ride out volatility longer-term.\n\nIt bears repeating: these risks don\u2019t mean an investor needs to rush to cash in their Bitcoin. In fact, for a couple of reasons, an investor can believe that both a) Bitcoin will crash again and b) Bitcoin still is worth owning right now.\n\nFirst, the crash may still be a long ways off \u2014 and more upside may follow. An analyst could have correctly predicted in early 2017 that BTC was going to crash within a year. A trader who listened to that advice still would have missed out on gains of at least 200%-plus. This rally doesn\u2019t have to end immediately.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s a case that trying to time the crash (assuming it arrives) is a fool\u2019s errand. Timing the stock market is a notoriously impossible strategy. Bitcoin\u2019s history suggests it isn\u2019t any different.\n\nLong-term bulls on Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) can reasonably argue that immense volatility simply is a fact of life, at least for now. But if the long-term bull case plays out, the ability to ride out that immense volatility will pay off, even if there\u2019s some short-term pain along the way.\n\nNeither is an unreasonable argument. But crypto holders need to at least understand that we\u2019ve been here before. Short-term bursts of optimism like we\u2019re seeing now almost always are followed by a reversal. I don\u2019t believe this time will be any different, though it remains to be seen how steep that reversal is, and from what point it begins.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vince Martin did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. \n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  Top Stock Picker Reveals His Next Potential Winner \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

He\u2019s now putting his money (shareholders\u2019) where his mouth is\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of dogecoin (DOGE-USD) has also surged in recent weeks after Musk began tweeting about it. The rise has coincided with a surge of populism in financial markets around the world.\n\nDogecoin hit a new all-time high this month, as celebrity attention including rapper Snoop Dogg continued to buoy up the price of the joke token.\n\nThe digital currency, which uses a Shiba Inu dog as its mascot, first started up as a joke in 2013 but has seen its market capitalisation pass $6bn.\n\nMusk first tweeted just the word \u201cDoge\u201d, followed by \u201cDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto\u201d, and \u201cNo highs, no lows, only Doge\u201d. He also posted a Lion King meme of him holding up the dogecoin dog as if it were Simba.\n\nHe said at the time: \"They are really just meant to be jokes, but you know Dogecoin was made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies obviously, but fate loves irony and often as a friend of mine says that the most ironic outcome or I'd say the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of earth in the future.\u201d\n\nBitcoin started 2020 at around $7,000 per coin. Despite its rise in the last year, the cryptocurrency remains extremely volatile and experts continue to remain sceptical about using it as an investment.\n\nHowever, a survey published last week showed almost two-thirds of UK investors intend to buy bitcoin in 2021 and well over half expect its value to increase to $60,000 (\u00a343,000).\n"}, {"headline": "18th February: BTC/USD Declines below 52,000, ETH/USD Comes Closer to 2,000", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/k2DbAF1AvUQTUTYVdRS5JA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/7429f1177a36957dadfb01d9b562eca7", "auther": "Anissimov Konstantin", "body": "The pair was declining until the afternoon.

This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top.

But is this sustainable for MARA stock?\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThese gains have far outpaced even Bitcoin\u2019s impressive run during the same period. As I wrote previously, this is understandable. With the costs of cryptocurrency mining largely fixed, a rise in the price of Bitcoin will produce an outsized increase in profits for the miner.\n\nThat\u2019s assuming Marathon already has a substantial crypto mining operation. However, it doesn\u2019t. Take a look at its financial results, and you\u2019ll see the company has generated just $1.5 million in sales over the past 12 months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCompare that to Marathon Patent\u2019s current market capitalization (around $4.2 billion), and it\u2019s clear things have gotten out of hand. Even with the proceeds of last month\u2019s $250 million registered direct offering, and the company\u2019s Bitcoin mining projections (more below), there\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019ll produce the results needed to justify today\u2019s valuation.\n\nWith this uncertainty in mind, it makes little sense to buy in at today\u2019s prices (around $45 per share).\n\nWith the surging interest in crypto prices, scores of small companies have looked to exploit the situation. It\u2019s similar to what we saw a few years back, during the last \u201cBitcoin boom.\u201d Companies with no prior interest in the space suddenly started calling themselves \u201ccryptocurrency companies.\u201d\n-  7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don\u2019t Get Tired Of \n\nWith stocks trading on major exchanges more accessible than Bitcoin itself, this hoodwinks many investors. And, with many buying on the headlines, instead of on fundamentals, shares in these high-flyers can reach unsustainable levels. That\u2019s what it\u2019s starting to look like with this situation.\n\nAdmittedly, unlike some of the other Bitcoin coattail riders out there, this early stage miner at least has laid out projections that (in theory) could justify its current stock price.\n\nAs seen from a Feb. 1 press release, Marathon has implied it\u2019ll soon be highly profitable, once it deploys all of its mining hardware. If it can put all of its machines into operation, the company could produce up to 60 bitcoins per day. At current prices ($50,000 per BTC), that means $3 million per day in revenue.\n\nWith its operating costs at around $4,500 per Bitcoin mined, that could mean $2.73 million per day in gross profit. On an annual basis, that\u2019s near $1 billion in gross profit. To some, numbers like this could help justify the company\u2019s current $4 billion valuation. Yet, mining Bitcoin is far from being a \u201cset it and forget\u201d type of operation. It may sound like all Marathon Patent has to do is plug in its hardware, and wait for the money to roll in.\n\nBut, there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. This aspiring miner will have to overcome substantial hurdles if it wants to live up to expectations.\n\nBased on the current price of BTC, it could be generating $1 billion per year, once it fully deploys its mining hardware. However, the aforementioned press release makes mining for crypto sound easier than it is in practice.\n\nNamely, it downplays the possible negative impact from what\u2019s known as the \u201cdifficulty rate.\u201d What\u2019s that? It\u2019s a measurement of the computing power it takes to mine a Bitcoin block. Over time, difficulty rates have continued to rise. As of late, this rate of difficulty has slowed down. This may give credence to this company\u2019s ambitious projections.\n\nYet, don\u2019t expect a slowing difficulty rate to last for long, given new hardware will soon come online.\n\nHow could this hurt Marathon Patent? If the \u201cdifficulty rate\u201d rises substantially, it\u2019ll mine far less Bitcoin than previously projected. The stock is priced as if its operations will go off without a hitch. But, if hiccups arise, shares have substantial room to fall.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019ve long been, and will continue to be, one of the biggest crypto bulls out there. But, the bull cases for crypto, and this stock, are not one and the same.\n\nWhile on the surface it may seem current trends support higher prices for Marathon Patent, unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. On paper it claims it could eventually produce 60 bitcoins per day. After expenses, that would mean nearly $1 billion per year in gross profits.\n\nYet, like I said above, mining for crypto is much more difficult in practice. With a high chance of this aspiring miner falling flat on its face, continue to avoid MARA stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matt McCall held a position in Bitcoin. \n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held a position in Bitcoin.\n\nMatthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors \u2014 by getting them into the world\u2019s biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

But in a market also made up of stocks, three Nasdaq-listed crypto plays are offering investors risk-adjusted exposure that\u2019s more secure both off and on the price chart. Let me explain.\n\nBoth Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) have been roiled by policy makers\u2019 rumblings. It\u2019s been a couple weeks since Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen hinted strongly at the U.S. government\u2019s interest in \u2018curtailing\u2019 the crypto market given the decentralized digital currencies\u2019 ties to bad actors and their illicit wheeling and dealings. The warning sent digital currencies tumbling into bear markets. And don\u2019t think for a second that regulatory risks will disappear.\n\nMore important, the crypto market and its tethered blockchain technology are seeing explosive growth and acceptance as an incredibly important tool for business.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlready Bitcoin is nearing $1 trillion in valuation. Then there are Square (NYSE:SQ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Those titans of finance are some of today\u2019s early large cap adopters of the crypto market. Don\u2019t bet against the house, right? They\u2019re not alone either.\n-  9 Meme Stocks That Social Media Won't Shut Up About \n\nLast week EV giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced a purchase of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and plans to accept the market\u2019s biggest digital currency for payment. At the same time Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) announced they\u2019ll begin allowing various financial transactions in select crypto coins.\n\nThe writing appears to be on the wall. Even in the face of stricter future oversight, digital currencies promise to continue providing very lucrative investment opportunities. A word to the wise before jumping in is warranted.\n\nAs we\u2019ve witnessed throughout crypto\u2019s re-emergence to all-time-highs, investors still need to be prepared for wild price action which can induce second-guessing, run-for-the-exits sell orders at the expense of one\u2019s trading account. But is there another way to participate with more defined exposure?\n\nToday, let\u2019s examine three behind-the-scenes crypto stocks within this burgeoning market. Instead of just being wise to the challenges and potential failures ahead, these Nasdaq-listed digital currency plays are offering smarter money strategies which won\u2019t extend or put the wallet at unnecessary and outsized risk.\n- Bit Digital (NASDAQ:BTBT)\n- Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n- Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN)\n\n Source: Charts by TradingView\n\nThe first of our crypto stocks to buy are shares of Bit Digital. According to Yahoo Finance the company engages in Bitcoin mining and recently changed its name from Golden Bull to better reflect its business activities. Despite being a fairly new entrant into the space, New York-based BTBT is one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies listed on Nasdaq.\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m always suspect of a company name change and business pivot of this kind. And being lured into a long stock position by year-over-year quarterly sales growth of around 64,000% isn\u2019t a great idea. The fact is revenues for the latest period came in at $13 million compared to a valuation of nearly $850 million for this crypto. It\u2019s steep. Bit Digital also remains in the red.\n\nStill, investors are buying in to the BTBT stock story in a big way and it looks worthy of calculated exposure.\n\nTechnically, Bit Digital recently broke out of a massive corrective cup-shaped base to new all-time-highs to finish off 2020. To complement that bullish price action, in 2021 shares of this crypto have put together a well-supported test of the stock\u2019s prior high.\n\nBTBT has pulled back near its 50% retracement level within a smaller corrective \u2018V-shaped\u2019 base. And coupled with a favorable bullish stochastics crossover, this crypto looks ready for buying into.\n\nFavored Strategy: May $25/$40 Bull Call Spread\n\n Source: Charts by TradingView\n\nRiot Blockchain is the next of our crypto stocks to buy. RIOT was one of the digital currency market\u2019s more notorious listed stocks during the asset group\u2019s 2017 \u2013 2018 run-up and subsequent crash. And like BTBT, this diversified blockchain play seemingly came out of nowhere, pivoting and changing its corporate name. It was suspect to say the least. Today however, it\u2019s time to let bygones be bygones.\n-  8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double \n\nTechnically, this crypto stock has just taken out its own bubble high. Even a minor correction could cause RIOT stock investors to blink or more aptly, barf, given the stock\u2019s underlying volatility. As much, playing for continued momentum while maintaining ironclad downside risk is the way to position.\n\nFavored Strategy: March $55/$65 Bull Call Spread\n\n Source: Charts by TradingView\n\nCanaan is the last of our crypto stocks to buy. China-based CAN is the picks-and-shovels play of today\u2019s stocks. The outfit manufacturers equipment used to mine Bitcoin. Canaan is also involved in the development of blockchain technology and, teasingly, the booming artificial intelligence and data center markets.\n\nTechnically, CAN is gunning for a breakout to all-time-highs as shares muscle their way toward the high of a pattern lifetime cup-shaped base. With the stock jumping past the 76% retracement level and weekly stochastics signaling a bullish crossover in neutral territory, a bit of strategic exposure to this crypto looks ripe today.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong? Let\u2019s not find out. At the same time, investors might consider using CAN\u2019s less desirable price volatility to their advantage by hedging a purchase of this crypto stock with a defined risk and highly flexible collar strategy.\n\nFavored Strategy: April $10/$20 Collar\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Tyler holds, directly or indirectly, positions in listed Bitcoin and Ethereum stocks (GBTC, ETHE and ETCG), but no other securities mentioned in this article.\n\nChris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

The cryptocurrency had come close to breaking through the historic level in the early hours of the morning but pulled back. Bitcoin was trading at $50,311.63 at 12.38pm in London.\n\nThe new high extends a bull run for bitcoin that began last October. The world's biggest cryptocurrency has risen over 350% since then.\n\nThe rally has coincided with increased institutional adoption. PayPal (PYPL) said last year it would allow customers to handle the token through its platform and Mastercard (MA) followed suite last week. BNY Mellon, America's oldest bank, said it too would handle bitcoin on behalf of clients, paving the way for more money to flow into the market.\n\nInstitutions have already been putting money into the cryptocurrency. Square (SQ) invested $50m into the cryptocurrency in October and wealth manager Ruffer put some of its \u00a321bn ($29bn) in assets into bitcoin last November. The biggest jolt came when Tesla (TSLA) announced at the start of this month that it had invested $1.5bn into the cryptocurrency.\n\n\"Bitcoin\u2019s ascent from $40k to $50k took 6 weeks, a relative snail\u2019s pace given its move from $20k to $40k happened in 3 weeks,\" said Antoni Trenchev, chief executive of cryptocurrency company Nexo.\n\nHe said the next big price milestone would be $100,000.\n\nWatch: What is bitcoin?\n\n\"Growing corporate support for the crypto makes this a very different market to what it was in 2017,\" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. \"Money printing and dollar debasement is also a factor.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"A decent amount of bitcoin supply is under institutional clients and US corporates' control.

I would know. Recently, I explained that I had to exit out of the Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) sector because it was too much. However, for those who are considering virtual currencies, you may be better served with blockchain stocks.\n\nFirst off, I simply don\u2019t know where cryptocurrencies as a speculative vehicle will end up. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I exited before the $50,000 target that I had previously called. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I still believe in the continued rise of Bitcoin, and, therefore, I maintain a modest position. But I also had to get something out of this ride. Otherwise, it\u2019d be for naught.\n\nSecond, blockchain stocks represent investments in the underlying technology of Bitcoin and other virtual tokens. While I\u2019m not 100% certain what the future of cryptos hold, I\u2019m much more confident in the belief that the decentralized distributed public ledger system will carry on. Not only that, the blockchain will spark additional innovations in the world of fintech.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis segues into my third point: The innovation underlining blockchain stocks represents true financial connectivity and integration. For instance, bank wire transfers are slow and expensive. Moreover, they become problematic when dealing with countries that may not have the most robust economic infrastructure. We need something that\u2019s cheap and effective, and only the blockchain has forwarded a reasonable proposal.\n\nBeyond that, mitigating or outright eliminating the friction in peer-to-peer transactions will help our own economy manage the destruction caused by the novel coronavirus. With the possibility of an extended recession, the number of individuals being forced out of the financial system may rise substantially. Therefore, only technology will solve this dilemma, which benefits these blockchain stocks to buy.\n-  7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don\u2019t Get Tired Of \n\nAs you can see from the list below, the available companies are very diverse, ranging from blue-chip giants to speculative names. Therefore, blockchain stocks offer something for everyone, irrespective of your risk tolerance. Let\u2019s take a look:\n- Visa (NYSE:V)\n- IBM (NYSE:IBM)\n- CME Group (NASDAQ:CME)\n- Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n- Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n- SolarWorld (OTCMKTS:SRWRF)\n- Bitfarms (OTCMKTS:BFARF)\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nInitially, many corporate and government institutions regarded Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as competition for the global financial system. Nothing could be further from the truth. In reality, by utilizing the blockchain innovation, blue-chip companies like Visa can offer services that meet the increasing demands of their clients.\n\nIn the credit card company\u2019s case, management developed the Visa B2B Connect platform, which processes corporate cross-border business-to-business payments in a safe, secure and predictable manner. This is huge for Visa, as virtual currencies as a concept will not be going away anytime soon.\n\nFurther, Visa stock can benefit from the superiority of the blockchain technology. Basically, the platform is more efficient than other alternatives because the trust component between two parties is not handled by a human (and therefore corruptible) entity but rather, an immutable digital record.\n\nIf you\u2019re not interested in the wild swings of the cryptocurrencies themselves, stable blockchain stocks like Visa provide exposure to a relevant innovation that won\u2019t leave you hanging.\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you hear the term blockchain stocks, you can\u2019t help but think about the wild gyrations in the cryptocurrency markets. More than likely, something like IBM stock doesn\u2019t immediately fit the profile. However, as sedate as \u201cBig Blue\u201d may be for some investors, it\u2019s worth considering for safe exposure to this burgeoning technology.\n\nAs you may know, the company established its IBM Blockchain platform to help enterprises and institutions deal with various challenges that extend beyond financial purposes. A brilliant example of this is the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. Thanks to the blockchain\u2019s immutable characteristic, IBM is able to deliver real-time end-to-end traceability for vaccine distribution.\n\nWhile I hope that we never have to hear about Covid-anything in the future, if we do have another health crisis, Big Blue will be ready. That bodes well for IBM stock.\n-  7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Aren\u2019t a Gamble \n\nAnd like other blue-chip blockchain stocks, IBM has several other revenue channels in case the decentralized ledger doesn\u2019t pan out. In particular, its artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity solutions are compelling under the current circumstances.\n\nSource: Marko Aliaksandr/ShutterStock.com\n\nThough not directly one of the blockchain stocks, CME Group nevertheless gave the entire digital currency complex a massive credibility boost. You see, as the world\u2019s largest financial derivatives exchange, CME offers investors the ability to trade on almost anything. With cryptocurrencies as part of its offerings, the sector is now a legitimate one.\n\nIn addition, buying CME stock provides you with exposure to Bitcoin trading without having to step into the arena. In a way, owning equity in CME is the loose equivalent of selling tickets to the big game rather than betting on one team to beat the other. No, you\u2019re probably not going to get rich off CME, but you\u2019re likely not going to be left destitute.\n\nFurther, the ability to buy Bitcoin futures and trade options contracts affords the underlying asset the constant price movements that allow day trading to occur. Overall, CME Group\u2019s involvement in the space is positive for the digitalized economy, and it should turn out to be a good deal for CME stock too.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nTechnically more of a crypto-mining play, I nevertheless included Nvidia in this list of blockchain stocks because mining is what makes most decentralized distributed public ledgers tick. Again, the beauty of this platform is that two parties that don\u2019t necessarily trust each other don\u2019t have to rely on a third-party intermediary that both may not mutually trust. Instead, the intermediary is the blockchain system itself.\n\nHowever, public blockchains require participation of nodes (computers) to verify transactions that occur within the system. This is where mining comes into the picture, with blockchain users competing for the right to verify such transactions and receive digital tokens as a reward. However, to win this competition consistently usually entails intensive hardware. Arguably, Nvidia provides the best processors for mining tasks, which greatly benefits NVDA stock.\n-  7 Stocks That Elon Musk Loves \u2014 And That You Should Too \n\nFurther, you don\u2019t have to be a big believer in blockchain stocks to appreciate Nvidia. The semiconductor firm has exposure to multiple relevant businesses, including video games, machine learning and autonomous solutions. Thus, you really can\u2019t go wrong with NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf I\u2019m going to mention Nvidia on this list of blockchain stocks, then I\u2019m obligated to also include Advanced Micro Devices. Admittedly, this is part of self-preservation. Otherwise, I\u2019d get a lot of heat from fans of AMD stock, and I\u2019m already hundreds of emails behind. I don\u2019t need any more to flood my inbox.\n\nSeriously, though, Advanced Micro more than deserves inclusion as a blockchain/crypto-mining play. In recent years, the company has been taking it to its larger rivals. Years ago, AMD was an afterthought in the broader chip-manufacturing space. Now, it\u2019s a legitimate leader in multiple semiconductor segments, including graphics processing units (GPUs) that cater toward mining operations.\n\nAlso, you may be interested to know that AMD stock could possibly be a leading indicator for Bitcoin and major altcoins. It appears that a sizable rally in AMD shares precedes robust moves in the cryptocurrency. If that\u2019s true, I don\u2019t see why the two assets can\u2019t be mutually beneficial moving forward \u2014 higher interest crypto mining is generally good for both Bitcoin and AMD\u2019s GPU revenues.\n\nSource: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo, SolarWorld has nothing directly to do with blockchain stocks. And no, I haven\u2019t lost my mind. Just hear me out for a second.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrencies to skeptics sound like digital fairy dust, the truth is that the process of mining these tokens require real \u201cwork.\u201d That is, the energy needed to extract most virtual currencies require some level of sacrifice. Sure, sacrifice doesn\u2019t necessarily give them value. However, it would be wrong to assume that crypto coins are materialized for nothing.\n\nHowever, as cryptocurrencies have become more popular, the energy requirements needed to extract many of these coins have become much more intensive. And this is where SRWRF stock comes into the picture. As a solar energy investment, the underlying product could potentially help make crypto mining more profitable for newcomers as it may mitigate utility costs.\n-  9 Meme Stocks That Social Media Won't Shut Up About \n\nUsing solar energy to extract cryptocurrencies isn\u2019t a new concept. However, it could become incredibly popular now that this market has attracted mainstream attention. While SRWRF stock is a speculative trade, it\u2019s well worth consideration with \u201cdumb\u201d money.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGone are the days when you can mine Bitcoin on your laptop. As the original digital token increased in value and popularity, so too did its mining difficulty. Now, it can cost thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars to run a Bitcoin mining operation \u2014 and you\u2019re not even guaranteed to be successful with such a cash outlay!\n\nTherefore, crypto-mining farms \u2014 or dedicated mining centers \u2014 have popped up across the world. Bitfarms is one such mining farm, and, conceptually, it\u2019s an intriguing one. Utilizing clean and competitively priced hydroelectricity, BFARF stock represents an environmentally responsible way to mine Bitcoin.\n\nAs well, the company operates five mining facilities in Quebec, Canada. Geographically, this would seem to be an advantage as the colder climate should help prevent Bitfarms\u2019 mining equipment from overheating. You\u2019d think that this will help extend the life of the equipment, possibly making BFARF stock a shrewd speculative idea.\n\nNevertheless, this is a wild one, so don\u2019t get involved with money you can\u2019t afford to lose.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The latest headlines may be the most exciting ones yet for CEO Elon Musk\u2019s droves of social media supporters.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla reported a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). The headline understandably blew up online given the recent buying frenzy in both Tesla stock and bitcoin. But while cryptocurrency investors rejoiced, I wasn\u2019t the only one who saw Tesla\u2019s crypto investment as a potential red flag.\n\nWhile many of Musk\u2019s devoted followers see him as a champion of engineering and green energy, I believe his ultimate legacy will be a different one. I think Musk deserves the most credit for figuring out how to best navigate the modern social media landscape. I don\u2019t say that to be dismissive of everything he has accomplished at Tesla. But the massive gap between Tesla\u2019s business and its market valuation are a testament to Musk\u2019s ability to convince his followers that the company is something that it is not.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne way Musk controls the online narrative is by distracting from negative Tesla headlines. Musk could have chosen any time to buy Bitcoin, and he\u2019s an extremely savvy promoter. He definitely chose the timing of the Bitcoin purchase for a specific reason.\n\n\u201cChinese regulators summon Tesla on quality issues as consumers complain about quality\u2026but $Tesla bought $BTC,\u201d Scion Asset Management head Michael Burry recently tweeted. \u201cIn my mind\u2019s eye, so much #digitalconfetti.\u201d\n-  7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don\u2019t Get Tired Of \n\nBurry gained notoriety by profiting tremendously on the bursting of the housing market bubble during the financial crisis. Now he\u2019s betting on a similar bursting of the electric vehicle bubble by shorting Tesla stock.\n\nI recently wrote about how pissed off China seems to be with Tesla after it issued its second massive safety recall in less than a year. If you missed it, there\u2019s a good reason. The China news was buried under a mountain of Tesla bitcoin articles.\n\nIf you\u2019re skeptical of just how much Musk is able to control the TSLA stock narrative, consider this. Most Tesla investors would say Musk and Tesla are champions of the environment, fighting against the evil legacy auto market. Those legacy companies, like Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), are destroying the world with their internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. That\u2019s the narrative, at least.\n\nIn reality, both Ford and GM are investing hand over fist to electrify their products. GM is investing $27 billion in rolling out 30 new EV models by 2025. Ford is investing $22 billion in its own electrification efforts between now and 2025.\n\nMeanwhile Musk and Tesla, champions of the environment, are investing in Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining emits 36.95 megatons of CO2 annually. That\u2019s equal to the emissions of about 8 million ICE automobiles, according to the EPA. Ford and GM sold about 6.7 million vehicles combined in 2020. In other words, in 2020, Bitcoin did far more damage to the environment than both those companies combined.\n\nBitcoin is horrible for the environment. So why did Musk buy? I think Burry is right about the possibility that Tesla\u2019s China business may be in trouble. It\u2019s also not great that third-party testers recently found Tesla\u2019s real-world battery ranges are consistently significantly lower than advertised. Car and Driver has compiled an excellent summary of how Tesla cheats the system on its mileage ranges.\n\nFormer Bernstein analyst and CEO of Aegon Asset Management Gary Black recently disclosed that he sold his stake in Tesla stock after buying in August 2019. He said he would be looking to buy back in at some point, but there seems to be too much risk at the moment.\n\n\u201cThe absence of clear FY\u201921 delivery guidance, increased odds of a 1Q miss, and a more risky capital allocation policy/higher earnings variability were the primary factors.\u201d Black said.\n\nThe more risky capital allocation policy seems to be a direct reference to Bitcoin, which is little more than a casino at this point. I don\u2019t think Musk is simply gambling with Tesla\u2019s cash. I think there\u2019s a strong possibility he is deliberately distracting from Tesla\u2019s myriad of other problems.\n\nI\u2019m still not recommending anyone short TSLA stock. At this point, I believe Musk could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and his followers still wouldn\u2019t sell their Tesla shares. But I also wouldn\u2019t recommend buying stock in a company that has so much underlying risk related to its quality issues, its potential strained relationship with China, its reliance on waning regulatory credit sales, its looming tsunami of legacy auto market competition and its cryptocurrency market speculation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Wayne Duggan held a long position in GM.\n\nWayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "The Chart of the Week:", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/8dxTGWaTbrzsbY4FQOuGEw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/8e5bf91621412eb185fce0e72cb94889", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Following on from last week's analysis,\u00a0CAD/JPY Price Analysis: Bulls stepping in at a discount within long-term bullish trajectory, the cross is indeed headed in a northerly trajectory, albeit correcting.\n\nHowever, it is\u00a0expected to continue towards a measured target of 82.9150.\n\nThe cross spiked from within 4-hour demand on Thursday to print a higher high in resistance which has now seen the cross buckle to support in the 82.61 territories.\n\nThe following is a top-down analysis that illustrates a bullish bias still from a longer-term perspective.\n\nThe daily chart was showing prospects of a bullish fill of the wick left by the strong bid in the cross that crystalised at a 38.2% Fibonacci of the bullish impulse.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFrom a 4-hour perspective, the set-up was based on the correction's prospective floor at the support structure.

But improvements in distribution in recent weeks has seen the Canadian distribution program pick up its pace, and its now possible that market participants are no longer considering this an impediment, or at least a relative burden (compared to vaccination rates in the UK or US, for example). When we first examined how vaccines were weighing down the Loonie, Canada\u2019s vaccination rate was 2.6 per 100 people; now it stands at 3.6 per 100 people. Not great, and still not the pace seen in the UK or US, but it\u2019s an improvement.\n\nAlongside the vaccination pace starting to improve, a key pillar of the Canadian economy has been bolstered: energy markets have seen prices surge higher in recent days (in part, thanks to the Texas energy disaster). Energy accounts for approximately 11% of Canadian GDP, so there has been the typical cross-asset flow of funds into the Canadian Dollar as a proxy for rising oil prices. \n\nAs the polar vortex contracts, upside momentum in energy markets may be curtailed, meaning that the Loonie may have a bit of a fight on its hands as it attempts bullish breakout attempts vis-\u00e0-vis CAD/JPY and USD/CAD rates.\n\nFor weeks it was noted that \u201cCAD/JPY rates have tested parallel channel resistance in the 81.58/91 area, but have struggled to make headway, a common occurrence since June 2020. But the more times resistance (or support) is tested, the more likely it is to break as supply on the other side of the trade is exhausted. As trading is a function of both price and time, by simply maintaining their elevation, CAD/JPY rates are now above the descending trendline from the January 2018, October 2018, and February 2020 highs, and holding right at the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement of the 2020 high/low range at 82.16\u2026While more patience may still be required, CAD/JPY bulls may be on high alert for a bullish breakout attempt.\u201d\n\nThis patience has paid off, with CAD/JPY rates breaking above the 81.58/91 area, currently trading at 83.65 at the time this report was written. CAD/JPY rates are above their daily 5-, 8-, 13-, and 21-EMA envelope, which is in bullish sequential order. Daily MACD is rising while above its signal line, while daily Slow Stochastics are holding overbought territory. A break of the yearly high at 83.75 would signal bullish continuation.\n\nIn the most recent Canadian Dollar forecast update, it was noted that \u201cUSD/CAD rates have run into downtrend from the March and October 2020 highs, which has served as resistance on four such attempts over the past two weeks.\u201d The pair was never able to break this downtrend, and instead, a reconstituted chart suggests that a descending triangle has been forming dating back to early-December 2020, with support defined by the 2021 yearly low at 1.2589. \n\nUSD/CAD rates are seeing bearish momentum gather pace. USD/CAD rates are below their daily 5-, 8-, 13-, and 21-EMA envelope, which is now in bearish sequential order. Daily MACD is declining and is now below its signal line, while daily Slow Stochastics are falling back into oversold territory.

Usually, higher yields due to concerns of higher inflation are a supportive factor for the US dollar, but, this time, the greenback may have felt the heat of the disappointing initial jobless claims. As for today, investors may focus on the preliminary PMIs for February from several Eurozone nations, the Eurozone as a whole, the UK and the US.\n\nThe US dollar turned south against all the other G10 currencies on Thursday and during the Asian session Friday. It lost the most ground versus GBP, NZD and NOK, while it underperformed the least versus CAD, JPY, and CHF.USD performance G10 performanceThe relative weakness of the safe-havens yen and franc, combined with the relative strength of the Kiwi, suggests that markets traded in a risk-on fashion yesterday and today in Asia. However, turning our gaze to the equity world we see that this was not the case. Major EU and US indices were a sea of red, with market sentiment being more on the mixed side during the Asia trading today. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng slid 0.72% and 0.21% respectively, but China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and South Korea\u2019s KOSPI gained 0.57% and 0.68%.Major global stock indices performanceEquities continued to slide on rising bond yields, but the US dollar failed to capitalize this time. Germany\u2019s 10-year yield posted its highest close since June yesterday, the UK ones traded at a 10-month high, while the US 10-year stayed near a one-year high.\u00a0Usually, higher yields due to concerns of higher inflation are a supportive factor for the US dollar, but, this time, the greenback may have felt the heat of the disappointing initial jobless claims, which rose to 861k from an upwardly revised 848k the week before.\u00a0The forecast was for a decline to 765k. This adds to evidence that the recovery in the US labor market is slowing down.\n\nAs for today, investors may focus on the preliminary PMIs for February from several Eurozone nations, the Eurozone as a whole, the UK and the US. Eurozone\u2019s manufacturing PMI is anticipated to have inched down to 54.3 from 54.8, while the services one is forecast to have risen to 45.9 from 45.4. This is likely to drive the composite index fractionally higher, to 48.0 from 47.8.\u00a0Although a minor improvement, this still points to contraction, and we don\u2019t think that this will affect much the euro. For the euro to gain, we believe that an upside surprise above 50 may be needed.\u00a0\n\nIn any case, the minutes of the latest ECB gathering revealed that other members shared Lagarde\u2019s view that the downside risks to the economic outlook were now \u201cless pronounced\u201d but added that not every increase in nominal yields should be interpreted as unwarranted tightening, suggesting that monetary policy will stay extra loose.\u00a0They also said that the projected path of inflation continues to be distant from the inflation target, which comes in contrast with current market expectations over a fast rise in inflation.\n\nThere are no forecasts for the UK PMIs, while in the US, both the manufacturing and services indices are expected to have slid somewhat, to 58.5 and 57.6 from 59.2 and 58.3. Now, a decent question is: What could be the reaction if we get a positive surprise? Will equities rebound on signs of a faster economic recovery, or will they fall as something like that may also mean faster inflation in the not-to-distant future?\u00a0As for our view, with the minutes of the latest FOMC gathering confirming that the Fed is likely to stay accommodative for the years to come, and that inflation is expected to overshoot 2% for some time in the years after 2023, we believe that tightening concerns due to higher inflation may start fading, and thereby equities could rebound.\u00a0For the dollar, it appears to be simpler. Recently, the currency has lost its safe-haven appeal, which means that better prints could prove positive.\n\nAfter hitting the area near the 3742 barrier on Tuesday, Euro Stoxx 50 moved lower and is now resting on one of its key support levels, at 3682, marked by the high of Feb. 8. At the same time, the price continues to balance above a short-term tentative upside support line taken from the low Feb. 4. As long as the index remains above both of those obstacles, there is a good chance we could see another push higher. However, to get a bit more comfortable with that idea, a move above the 3710 barrier would be needed.\n\nIf, eventually, the price does pop back above the 3710 hurdle, marked by the low of Feb. 15 and yesterday\u2019s high, that may invite more bulls into the field. Euro Stoxx 50 would also be placed above the 21 EMA on our 4-hour chart. The index might end up re-visiting the current highest point of this week, at 3742. If the buying doesn\u2019t stop there, the next target could be at 3775, marked by the low of Feb. 21, 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, if the aforementioned upside line breaks, this could lead to a change of the short-term trend. The index may slide to the low of Feb. 12, at 3646, or to the 3624 zone, marked by the low of Feb.10. Euro Stoxx 50 could stall near the latter one, but if the bulls are still feeling weak, this may result in a further slide, where the next target could be at 3597, which is the low of Feb. 4.EUR Stoxx 50 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nOn Wednesday, EUR/USD reversed higher and is now seen trading above a short-term tentative upside support line drawn from the low of the Feb. 5. At the time of writing, the pair is trading near all of its EMAs on our 4-hour chart. Although there is a chance for the rate to push higher, a break above the 1.2104 hurdle could strengthen that scenario. For now, we will take a cautiously-bullish approach.\n\nIf, eventually, the pair rises above the 1.2104 barrier, marked by an intraday swing low of Feb. 16, which also coincides with the 200 EMA, that may attract more buyers into the game. EUR/USD could travel to the 1.2124 obstacle, a break of which might clear the path to the 1.2169 level. That level is marked by the current highest point of February.\n\nAlternatively, if the rate suddenly drops below the aforementioned upside line and then drifts below the current low of this week, that may invite more sellers into the game, as such a move would confirm a forthcoming lower low. That\u2019s when EUR/USD could drift to the 1.1972 hurdle, a break of which may clear the path to the 1.1952 level, marked by the current lowest point of February.EUR/USD 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nDuring the early European morning, the UK retail sales for January came out, with both the headline and core retail sales falling by more than anticipated.

By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033.

Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week.

While the bond market is doubling down on reflationary bets, other assets are failing to show signs of upbeat risk sentiment. The risk is that the rise in US yields has gathered such pace so as to start being self-defeating and cause a correction in risk assets. In FX, the combination of higher US yields and choppy equity performance is indeed the perfect recipe for a stronger US dollar. The key risk events today are the release of US retail sales for January and the FOMC minutes later in the day (1900 GMT). The bond market may remain fragile as retail sales could be on the strong side (hence feeding the reflation story) and also in the run-up to the FOMC minutes, where markets are likely factoring in some initial discussion among members about the timing of unwinding monetary stimulus. The bar for a hawkish surprise is therefore set quite high, and the release of the minutes may mitigate the selling pressure on US Treasuries, possibly starting to re-establish a setting where a more controlled increase in yields does not interfer with rising equities. Until then, the dollar should continue to find some support across the board.\n\nThe EUR has not been a major victim of the dollar rally, partly thanks to a surprise jump in the German ZEW yesterday that mitigated the uncertainty about the eurozone outlook. The calendar is quiet today in the region, and dynamics in US yields should drive most moves in EUR/USD. Additional USD outperformance may send the pair into the lower half of the 1.20/1.21 range, but the 1.2000 psychological level (it is also the 100-day moving average) could act as a fairly solid support.\n\nAs highlighted in \u201cG10 FX short-term valuation: Most currencies have further to run vs USD\u201d, sterling has recently moved into overvalued territory vs the euro, according to our model. Sterling has usually shown a tendency to overshoot on the undervaluation side in the past few years, largely on the back of Brexit uncertainty. With this factor out of the equation now, we could see more GBP overvaluation overshoots instead. Today, cable may suffer on further USD strength, but the EUR/GBP downside bias should remain intact.\n\nA soft patch for the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars may continue today as global risk appetite stays subdued. Of the three, CAD may face more limited downside thanks to well-supported oil prices. The release of CPI in Canada and jobs data in Australia should have limited monetary policy - and therefore FX \u2013 implications.\n\nRead the original analysis: FX daily: Riding the

Today, the item on the agenda which could attract some special attention may be the minutes from the latest ECB policy gathering. \u00a0We will scan the minutes to see whether Lagarde\u2019s view over \u201cless pronounced\u201d downside risks is shared among other officials as well.\n\nThe US dollar continued trading higher against the majority of the other G10 currencies on Wednesday and during the Asian morning Thursday. It gained the most versus CHF, EUR, and NOK in that order, while it was found virtually unchanged against AUD and JPY.USD performance G10 currenciesThe strengthening of the US dollar and the Japanese yen suggest that markets continued trading in a risk-off manner yesterday and today in Asia. However, the weakening of the Swiss franc and the strengthening of the Aussie point otherwise. Thus, in order to get a clearer picture with regards to the broader market sentiment, we prefer to turn our gaze to the equity world.\n\nThere, major EU indices were a sea of red, while in the US, Nasdaq fell 0.58%. The S&P 500 finished virtually unchanged, while the Dow Jones gained 0.29%. In Asia, sentiment was soft again, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and South Korea\u2019s KOSPI falling 0.19%, 1.70% and 1.50% respectively.\n\nThe exception was China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, which gained 0.55% on its first trading day after the Lunar New Year celebrations.Major global stock indices performanceEquities continued to pull back, perhaps as rising inflation expectations continued to push bond yields higher, with the benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield hitting its highest in a year yesterday. This means that the reflation trade could prove to be positive for equities but only to the point where the rise in bond yields is considered too fast, which could raise speculation over monetary-policy tapering by major central banks.\n\nHowever, we believe that it is too early for something like that and the minutes from the latest FOMC meeting add credence to our view.\u00a0Yes, officials noted that PCE prices \u2013 their favorite inflation metric \u2013 were projected to move briefly above 2% in the second quarter of 2021, but this would prove to be temporary and eventually inflation is expected to finish the year at just below 2%.\n\nInflation was projected to moderate overshoot 2% for some time in the years beyond 2023, but with monetary policy assumed to remain accommodative.\u00a0Thus, with no signs of tapering any time soon, we believe that equities have the potential to rebound again, and safe havens to come under renewed selling interest.\n\nToday, the item on the agenda which could attract some special attention may be the minutes from the latest ECB policy gathering. Despite the lockdown measures around the Eurozone, at the press conference following that decision, President Lagarde said that the downside risks to the economic outlook are now \u201cless pronounced\u201d, making investors skeptical over further easing,\u00a0although the Bank repeated once again that it stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate.\u00a0Therefore, we will scan the minutes to see whether Lagarde\u2019s view is shared among other officials as well, and whether indeed the chances for more easing have lessened for now. Something like that may benefit somewhat the euro.\n\nAfter finding resistance near the 30717 barrier on Tuesday, Nikkei 225 started correcting lower. That said, the downmove might get halted, if the short-term tentative upside line, drawn from the low of Jan. 31, continues to provide support. For now, we will take a cautiously-bullish approach.\n\nAs mentioned above, if the aforementioned upside line remains intact, the bulls may take advantage of the lower price and lift it up again. That\u2019 when we will target yesterday\u2019s high, at 30585, or the 30717 barrier, marked by the current highest point of this week. Initially, Nikkei 225 might stall there for a bit, or even correct back down again. However, if the index stays above the previously-mentioned upside line, another push higher could be possible. If this time the bulls are able to overcome the 30717 hurdle, the next possible target could be at 31371, marked by the highest point of August 1990.\n\nOn the other hand, if the aforementioned upside line breaks and the index also falls below the 29660 zone, marked by the high of Feb. 12, that may open the door for further declines. Nikkei 225 may then slide to the low of Feb. 10, at 29177, a break of which could set the stage for a move to the 28720 level. That level is marked near the high of Feb. 3 and by an intraday swing low of Feb. 5.Japan's Nikkei 225 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nEUR/JPY drifted to the downside yesterday, after finding resistance near the 128.45 barrier. The pair is in slight consolidation this morning; however, it may continue its journey south for a bit more. That said, as long as the rate remains above a short-term upside support line, drawn from the low of Jan. 18, this move lower might be seen as a temporary correction only.\n\nIf the rate drifts below the 127.31 zone, marked by yesterday\u2019s low, that could send the pair towards its next potential support area, near the 126.98 hurdle, marked by the low of Feb. 12. Around there, the pair may also find support from the aforementioned upside line. EUR/JPY might get picked up by the bulls there, and if so, it could travel back up to the 127.31 obstacle, or even the 127.68 hurdle, marked by an intraday swing low of Feb. 15. If the buying doesn\u2019t stop there, the next potential target might be at 127.97, or at 128.45, which is the current highest point of February.Alternatively, if the previously-mentioned upside line breaks and the pair falls below the 126.70 hurdle, marked by the low of Feb. 11, that could also place the rate below the 200 EMA on our 4-hour chart. This may be seen as a bearish indication and more sellers could join in. EUR/JPY might then drift to the 126.43 obstacle, a break of which may clear the path to the 126.10 level. That level is marked by the current lowest point of February.EUR/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nThe US building permits and housing starts for\u00a0January are\u00a0coming out, and they are both expected to have declined somewhat from their December readings.\u00a0We also get the initial jobless claims for last week, with the forecast pointing to a small decline, to 765k from 793k the week before.\n\nWith regards to the energy market, we get the EIA (Energy Information Administration) report on crude oil inventories for last week, with the forecast pointing to a 2.429mn barrels decline following a 6.644mn fall the week before.\u00a0Yesterday, the API reported a 5.800mn barrels slide and thus, we would consider the risks surrounding the EIA forecast as tilted to the downside. Combined with the ongoing deep freeze in Texas, this is likely to boost oil prices even further.\n\nTonight, during the Asian morning Friday, Japan\u2019s National CPIs for January are due to be released. There is no forecast available for the headline rate, while the core one is anticipated to have risen to -0.7% yoy from -1.0%.\n\nAs for the speakers, we have four on today\u2019s schedule: Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Fed Board Governor Lael Brainard, BoE MPC member Michael Saunders, and ECB Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel.\n\n\n"}, {"headline": "Chart Of The Day: EUR/USD May Have Started Ascent Towards 1.25 | Investing.com CA", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Fawad Razaqzada", "body": "This article was written exclusively for Investing.com\n\nToday\u2019s EU and UK manufacturing PMIs surprised to the upside and both the pound and euro rallied, with the cable hitting that $1.40 hurdle I have been forecasting for a while and GBP/CHF climbing to my 1.25 long-term target.\n\nMy focus is now turning to the euro, which could be about to break out soon and potentially head towards the 1.25 area next.\n\nWith the GBP/USD making its move first, the EUR/USD is now highly likely, in my opinion, to follow suit in climbing towards its own corresponding milestone of 1.25 handle next. That\u2019s because these currency pairs have a strong positive correlation with one another, as you can see below:\n\n3 months\n\n6 months\n\n1 year\n\nEUR/USD vs. GBP/USD\n\n+0.90\n\n+0.90\n\n+0.80\n\nBeyond this simple correlation matrix, there are obviously several other reasons, including both macro and technical considerations, why I am bullish on the single currency.\n\nFrom a macro point of view, the following are among some of the reasons, I hold a positive view towards the EUR/USD:\n\nMore to the point, it is the charts and price action\u2014reflecting the market\u2019s collective thoughts and actions\u2014that makes me uber-bullish on the EUR/USD.\n\nThe daily chart of the EUR/USD shows a clear bullish trend with rising moving averages and the price continuing to consolidate inside a bull flag pattern after holding its own above the key 1.20 support level:\n\nEUR/USD Daily\n\nWhat I would like to see next from a bullish point of view is a break above the shaded resistance range between 1.2150 and 1.2200. A clean break above this zone should offer decent buying opportunity on the rounded retest to potentially take us to new highs on the year.\n\nThe monthly chart is looking quite strong, too, with the long-term bear trend already having broken down in 2020 and with rates climbing and now holding above that 1.20 handle:\n\nEUR/USD Monthly\n\nThe fact that the EUR/USD has now moved back above the January 2021 low means that the sellers who were looking for a breakdown below 1.20 may have already been trapped. If the bears are indeed trapped, which I think is the case, then a quick rally above the January range, at 1.2350, is likely, where a cluster of sellers\u2019 stop orders will surely be resting\u2014thus providing a pool of liquidity for the market to reach for. This makes it likely we will see an accelerated move higher towards 1.25s in the coming weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, the EUR/USD on this long-term time frame also seems to be following the path of the 2017-18 rally when rates surged higher earlier in the year before spending a few months in consolidation ahead of more gains in early parts of 2018. Since March last year, the EUR/USD has again rallied in a very similar fashion, consolidated for a while below the 1.20 handle and then broke out again. If this is anything to go by then a rally towards, and potentially beyond, 1.25 could be on the cards next.\n\nSo, the EUR/USD charts look quite bullish. As such, I would be more inclined to look for buying than selling opportunities as things stand and in any case until the charts suggest otherwise.\n"}, {"headline": "DXY vs S&P's vs Gold", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zsN8_u4ssqAGXoQvoV4ofA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/76825f5773348b586328b2db07473959", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "To respectfully indulge words from the last post for context:\n\nOverall, EUR/USD was the first currency in August 2020 to break above its 5 year average at 1.1300\u2019s then the 10 year average in December 2020 at 1.2100\u2019s. EUR/USD is categorized in the class of a risk asset and non USD currency.\n\nEUR/USD\u2019s early break to its 5 year average set remainder 27 currencies on a course of deep perspective as non USD currency pairs had to not only match EUR/USD\u2019s break to significant averages but the 1000 pip rise in GBP/USD, 700 for AUD/USD and other non USD currency pairs traded weekly from overbought to overbought and a non normal price circumstance. EUR/USD\u2019s break threw normal price markets deeply off course since August 2020.\n\nNon USD currency pairs such as DXY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY only option since August 2020 was to concur with EUR/USD and non USD rises by trading deeply oversold week to week and to break 5 and 10 year averages.\n\nEUR/USD and non USD currency pairs as risk assets followed risk asset counterparts in stock markets higher to current richter scale overbought levels. The S&P's at 3900.00's trade at\u00a0 extreme overbought levels. The DAX achieved all time highs. Stock market longs are virtually impossible until a significant correction occurs.\n\nDXY\n\nDXY for example just broke above its 10 year monthly average at 89.95 and contains a long way to travel to the 5 year average at 95.00\u2019s. A currency pair to trade at a 10 year monthly average is not only a low, low price but extraordinary and highlights the magnitude to the\u00a0 rises and falls since last August.\n\nNext averages above to break are located at 91.43, 92.78 then 94.39 and 94.16. DXY from monthly averages 1 to 7 years faces stiff resistance from 94.00's to 95.00's. A break through this brick wall then DXY will travel easily to 97.00's and 99.00's.\n\nDXY below 89.95 targets 86.43, 84.32 and 81.83 at extreme oversold.\n\nTargets for DXY above 89.95 are located at 90.86, above 91.43 then 92.15,\u00a0 92.47 and 92.66. Above 92.78 targets 92.87 and 92.89.\n\nDXY from current ranges from 89.95 to 92.78 trade at its widest ranges. As DXY travels higher then ranges severely compress. The opposite is true for EUR/USD as the higher it trades then ranges open much wider.\n\nDespite a low price and trade below monthly 5 year averages, DXY is mid range to oversold/ overbought.\n\nS&P's\n\nDXY viewed from the S&P's informs trade location miles above the 5 year monthly average at 2722.43 and at overbought to extremes. Overbought S&P's reveals a healthy correction is on the way, DXY higher and EUR/USD as well as non USD currency pairs to follow much lower.\n\nThe S&P's are held by immediate averages at 3257.68, 3119.54 and 2989.17. A correction targets 3598.53, 3416.84 and 3300.20. A 400 point correction to the S&P's assumes DXY travels 300 ish pips higher and\u00a0 breaks above 92.78 to trade between 92.78 to 94.39.\n\nS&P averages from 3257.68 travels every 100 points to 2200.00's at the 10 year monthly average. Current S&P's ranges are fairly suppressed however as S&P's drop then ranges expand as the downside gains progresses.\n\nGold\n\nGold trades above its 5 year monthly average at 1461.20 and trades misaligned to the S&P's. Gold and the DXY are the same assets and should trade below 5 year monthly averages while the S&P's trade above.\n\nGold's drop is held by 1815.65 and below targets 1642.17 and 1543.98. Gold is deeply overbought from a medium and long term perspective. Gold is finished above at 1943.62 and short is the only trade available.\u00a0\n\nMoving forward, long USD and DXY is the best option while short Gold and the S&P's although Gold lacks any real range capability. Gold viewed from 150 to 200 points is a viable option as it fails to contain any big price moves.\n"}, {"headline": "Euro Forecast: Why Bulls Like EUR/JPY More Than EUR/USD", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/hD.CP8K5AknbE3Yvtv_VBA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/2b1579959f6ef2083a7f7d9790ce37ea", "auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "The world of FX is based on relativity, and relatively speaking, the EU is trailing other developed economies with its vaccination rates, and the EU is growing less robustly than other regions.

The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "FOREX-Dollar held down by doubts over pace of U.S. recovery; bitcoin retreats from record high By...", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/A446FlTm9bC246uOQDne_g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/f7708b344cc905a5a8a34e3a0947f867", "auther": "Stock ", "body": "* Dollar index near two-week low after retreat fromtwo-month high* Bitcoin dips below $46,000 a day after hitting record$49,714.66* Graphic: World FX rates https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5EBy Kevin BucklandTOKYO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The dollar started the week pinnednear two-week lows on Monday as traders questioned whether therecovery from the pandemic in the United States would be as fastas expected.Bitcoin BTC=BTSP remained volatile, retreating to as lowas $45,914.75 a day after reaching a record $49,714.66.The world's most popular cryptocurrency had rallied 25% lastweek, driven by endorsements from Tesla TSLA.O and BNY MellonBK.N .

The battle between the bulls and bears remains fierce, and until now, there is no clear winner.\n\nAs the year started, most bank analysts anticipated a weaker US dollar, and in the first few days, that outlook looked right as the DXY declined by 0.81%. Yet, just six days into the New Year, the DXY started to trade higher and was up by 1.81% by February 4. The near term outlook is neutral, but the dollar index might be on its way to carving out a bearish head and shoulders pattern.\n\nAs we can see in the chart below, the February 17 high coincidences with the January 18 high to form what could be a symmetrical-head and shoulders pattern. The head is the 2021 high of 91.62, and a break to the neckline, and February low of 91.11, could be the start of a slide to the 88.59 level.\n\nTalking against this bearish view is the IMM/COT positioning. Speculative positioning is clearly less long the EURUSD, yet they switched their positions to GBPUSD longs instead of just closing out their bearish USD bets. The U+S Dollar remains, therefore, extremely oversold against EUR, JPY, GBP, CHF, CAD, AUD, NZD, MXN, BRL, and RUB. We would need to go back to 2011 to see the market this bearish against the USD.\n\nAn alternative take on the market is that the Dollar index will ultimately trade above the right shoulder high at 91.05, and therefore trigger the so-called the \u201cfailed-head-and-shoulders-pattern.\u201d This pattern suggests that a break to the right shoulder might lift the DXY to 92.57. The pattern target is derived by taking the difference between the neckline and head and adding it to the right- shoulder high. Ideally, the DXY would trade closer to the neckline before trying to take out the right- shoulder high. Nonetheless, this pattern is usually difficult to trade.\n\nWhat is clear from all of this is that the DXY will most likely consolidate further in the days ahead.\n\n\n"}, {"headline": "Forex technical analysis and forecast: Majors, equities and commodities", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/8dxTGWaTbrzsbY4FQOuGEw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/8e5bf91621412eb185fce0e72cb94889", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "After finishing the descending structure at 1.2044, EURUSD is forming a new consolidation range around this level.
