At this writing, ETH is hovering at $1,889, up more than 600% in the past 12 months. Put another way, the proverbial $1,000 invested in Ethereum last year would now be worth about $7,000.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Source: Shutterstock\n\n\nIn early February, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) introduced futures contracts in Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, which started in 2015 as a programmable blockchain. Such futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell Ether at a predetermined price at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace\u00a0contributor Vivian Medithi covered the topic earlier this month and highlighted, \u201cAnalysts expect to see increased institutional investment in ether as a result of the introduction of futures contracts, bolstering the recent bullish run in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s move comes about three years after its December 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures. At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon. So as a small allocation to a portfolio, it could be worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise.

In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH building overhead pressure threatens losses to $1,200", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "43 minutes ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/REIeQHMAYcmTIXjf3ot2qQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bfcbe8c59e51f681a528c61f971e9894", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Ethereum made a remarkable recovery following the slump to $1,400 from highs above $2,000.

It is trading slightly above an ascending channel\u2019s lower boundary. Increasing selling pressure puts this support in jeopardy. Note that if broken, Ethereum would be vulnerable to losses eyeing $1,200.\n\nThe 4-hour chart vividly illustrates a bearish picture based on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). This indicator, when used accurately, can suggest positions for selling the top and buying the dip positions.\n\nEther is in a bearish trend, as reinforced by the MACD line (blue) crossing below the signal line. Besides, the wide divergence between the two lines shows that bears have more influence.\n\nIf Ethereum slices through the channel\u2019s resistance and fails to find support at the 50 Simple Moving Average, losses may extend to $1,400 and $1,200, respectively.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe IOMAP model by IntoTheBlock (ITB) cements the bears\u2019 influence over the price by revealing the massive resistance zone between $1,645 and $1,693.

Trading above this zone will not be a walk in the park; thus, recovery may take longer to materialize.\n\nOn the flip side, Ethereum is sitting on relatively weak support areas, in turn, adding credibility to the bearish notion. However, the model brings our attention to subtle buyer congestion between $1,550 and $1,596. Here, roughly 366,000 addresses are currently profiting from the approximately 2.4 million ETH bought in the zone. In other words, this support area is not strong enough to hold Ethereum for long.\n\n\n\nEthereum IOMAP chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s uptrend is in jeopardy, but not all is lost for the bulls. Holding above the ascending channel\u2019s lower edge will give buyers a chance to focus on levels at $1,700 and $2,000. Support at this level will also encourage the bulls hiding on the sidelines to return to the market and contribute to the impeding tailwind.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum (ETH/USD) Falls 26% From Historic High; What's Next?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "NewsBTC", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/uODCo_yIa2bSLAfW7hCVJQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3b47359ce0612a5c63c201d5d072d26f", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "12 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Price analysis 2/24: BTC, ETH, BNB, DOT, ADA, XRP, LTC, LINK, BCH, XLM", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Cointelegraph", "date": "10 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/qpqsZzc38vlWOCgsWhlp5g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/6c1beef72c65a65158e1f4fe019706f5", "auther": "Rakesh Upadhyay ", "body": "Institutional investors continue to pour money into the crypto sector even with the current dip below $45,000.

This takes the company\u2019s total holding to 90,531 Bitcoin.\n\nAnother company that bought Bitcoin during the current market correction is Square. The company said it had acquired roughly \u201c3,318 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million.\u201d\n\nThese purchases by institutional investors show they are bullish on the long-term prospects of Bitcoin and believe that it is a good buy near $50,000. \n\nWhile the institutional purchases are a bullish sign, traders must also remember that for every buyer, there is a seller. Glassnode data suggests that Bitcoin whales, holding between 1,000 Bitcoin to 10,000 Bitcoin and \u201chumpback whales\u201d holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin have sold more than 140,000 Bitcoin in February. \n\nIn the past, the whales swayed the crypto markets at their will. But the entry of institutional investors has reduced their dominance. Therefore, along with the whales, traders must also keep an eye on the institutional activity.\n\nWhile large investors can buy and hold for the long-term, the smaller investor would do well to buy at the right time to make the most of the limited available capital. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s pullback from the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,323) on Feb. 22 was greeted with aggressive selling on February 23. The bears dragged the price below the channel, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows buying at lower levels.\n\nThe buyers are currently attempting to keep the BTC/USD pair inside the channel. However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. \n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise. \n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.\n\nEven as Binance Coin\u2019s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to turn up from 71. \n\nThe score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB\u2019s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS\u2122score, BNB price started to rally from $201. \n\nThat was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price.

A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.\n\nConversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969. \n\nThe long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT). \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS\u2122 score reached 82 when DOT\u2019s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS\u2122 score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24. \n\nDOT\u2019s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.\n\nA breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.\n\nThe bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.\n\nXRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.\n\nBuying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.\n\nThe next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.\n\nThe failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions. \n\nThe LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.\n\nIf the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.\n\nChainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.\n\nThe dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears. \n\nThe sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.\n\nIf the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23. \n\nThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The second-ranked crypto just set a new all-time high above $2,000.\n\nEthereum has broken a key psychological resistance barrier at $2,000.\n\nETH has crossed $2,000 for the first time. It\u2019s trading at $2,014 at the time of writing.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nThe digital asset has experienced a violent rise in recent weeks. On Jan. 4, it crossed $1,000 amid a flurry of activity across the crypto markets.\n\nThe run then intensified, with ETH touching $1,430 on Jan. 19, a record high at the time. ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run. ETH often outperforms BTC, however. It\u2019s up roughly 175% year-to-date, while BTC is up 89%.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has also had various wins of its own recently. On Feb. 8, ETH futures launched on CME Group, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange.\n\nThe NFT space, which runs on top of Ethereum, has also enjoyed a boom this year. Several notable celebrities and musicians have piled into the craze, among them Mark Cuban, Logan Paul, and Soulja Boy. This week, iconic auction house Christie\u2019s announced its plans to list an NFT by Beeple. They\u2019ll accept ETH in the auction.\n\nDeFi, meanwhile, continues to grow. There\u2019s over $43 billion locked in DeFi protocols today, according to DeFi Pulse. Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021. Described as an ETH buyback mechanism by EIP-1559 Tim Beiko, the update will see gas fees get burned to reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is now $232.8 billion.\n\nOriginal

newest Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) upgrade, the network\u2019s largest overhaul since it went live on Ethereum in 2019, a blog post shared with CoinDesk claims. Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: Arcane Research: Banking on Bitcoin \u2013 The State of Bitcoin As Collateral\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nazarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei. Gas fees are currently at historic highs with an average transaction surpassing $40 Tuesday, according to Blockchair.\n\nRelated: US Central Bank Explains 'Preconditions' for a Digital Dollar\n\nNot only will the update lessen congestion on Ethereum, but it should decrease call latency, Nazarov said.\n\n\u201cReally what OCR does is take the computation we were doing on-chain and porting it out to an off-chain environment, and that is creating a very large 10x increase in efficiency, which means we can put a lot more data on-chain,\u201d Nazarov said.\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n"}, {"headline": "Two NYC bars are for sale \u2014 asking price is 25 bitcoin", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/pf.E1D0Bf9xAOkzuMDgcHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/62f05ae0-7302-11eb-bfbf-f3b92472ae90", "auther": "Alexis Christoforous", "body": "A long-time restaurant owner in New York City is looking to sell his two bars for bitcoin. Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

And hide from these days we remained all alone. Staying in the same place, just staying out the time. Touching from a distance, Further all the time.\" Joy Division, Transmission\n\nOver the last few weeks I've been digging deep into my own assumptions about how the world works. I've seen enough cool stuff fly by to (occasionally) recognize when I should keep my mouth shut until I actually wade into a topic. That's largely how I've felt about Crypto. When Bitcoin took off about a decade ago, I did the obligatory amount of reading most nerds did, chuckled at all my Young Turk analysts buying Bitcoin for $49 or whatever it was at the time. I adopted the fashionable \"Tsk, Bitcoin, but Hrm, blockchain?\" stance that still pervades most of finance on the 'Security-Notional' side of the balance sheet -- the world of stocks and bonds and futures and options and all that jazz. I wasn't paying enough attention.\n\nI'm not writing this for all of you deep crypto nerds -- y'all are the ones I'm learning from. I fully expect y'all to:\n- Light me up over everything I've got wrong.\n- Point out the people and groups that already figured this out, but whom I couldn't find on Google this weekend.\n\nBut for the rest of you:\n\nLet's start by thinking about what the whole point of a mutual fund or ETF or SMA or CIT is to you as the investor. You move money from the Cash economy (where we actually accumulate and spend dollars) to the Security-Notional economy (where we own assets we mark to a \"price\") through a brokerage account. That's quite literally the point of your broker. They sit between the Cash Economy and the Security-Notional economy and help you transact in the later. You allocate money from your cash into, say, an ETF. That ETF is nothing more than a slice of intellectual property (IP), whether they come from MSCI as part of an index, or from Cathie Wood's team at ARK Invest. That IP is then implemented through trades in underlying securities, through in kind creations or by taking cash from an Authorized Participant, and dozens of other fun but shockingly complex bits of work happen under the hood to keep the portfolio trued up (corporate actions, splits, M&A, securities lending, etc.) You can imagine it a bit like this:\n\nSo what are you really paying for? Well, sometimes the IP involved is expensive, and unique (like, say, the active management of ARKK). Sometimes it's relatively simple and loaded with competition (like, say, MSCI's large cap U.S. Index). You as an investor should expect to pay accordingly. You're also paying for all the other stuff, but that tends to be relatively inexpensive. If your ETF is in U.S. stocks, you'd expect it to be cheap, but if its emerging market local currency debt with hedging overlays? Well, you'd expect to pay a bit more.\n\nLet's tease this out and try to imagine the most efficient way this could work. The actual IP here is trivial to package up. It's just a continuous broadcast of portfolio state, a carnival barker yelling \"STEP RIGHT UP AND SEE TODAY'S S&P 500.\" In the world of modern data, there's little difference between publishing that daily in the Wall St. Journal and building an API that a computer could poke at on demand to get constituents. Even the most active manager does essentially the same thing: they just say what the contents of the IP are, all the time.\n\nIn order to get paid for that IP, we've created all sorts of systems. Most involve you literally giving the money to the IP holder, and letting them handle the rest. If you want access to ARK, you can buy a mutual fund or an ETF, or if you're big enough, open up an SMA. But regardless, you move money across the notional barrier from your pile of cash into some Security-Notional vehicle, which ARK then manages. But what you're really looking for is the IP. Index providers get paid a little differently - they license their intellectual property to pretty much anyone, but the real money is in licensing it to fund managers who package it up into ETFs and funds of their own. They also license their IP to media, researchers, data providers, and so on.\n\nThe implementation part turns out to be relatively annoying. So much so that we've created all sorts of products to avoid it: index futures in particular were created to avoid the friction of implementation (among other things). So were 'synthetic ETFs' in Europe or Exchange-Traded Notes here in the U.S., and of course a huge chunk of the derivatives markets from swaps to structured notes. The IP is what matters. The implementation is just friction.\n\nThe New Hotness, in case you missed it, is 'Non-Fungible Tokens' or NFTs. The idea of an NFT is pretty simple: it's simply a digital blob that can't be duplicated, and it is one of a kind. This is distinct from Bitcoin, which are digital blobs of which there are currently 18 million. Yours is exactly as useful as mine. With an NFT, you make a one and done for each token. You can 'burn' it, but you can't change it, and it's unique. This the idea behind the widely popularized NBA TopShot digital collectible ... THINGS.\n\nA Sidebar for Nerds: I am hung up on digital objects having utility, and I'm trying to get past it. I have opened countless 'digital packs' of 'digital cards' that I paid real money for to play a game called Magic: The Gathering. Those fake things had real utility to me, because I enjoy playing a game that I can only play if I have those cards. I have absolutely no emotional attachment to my ownership of them. At the very same time, I don't, at my core, understand or appreciate the value of a piece of digital artwork which I could see in my browser right now for free, just because you tell me mine's 'official'. Give me copyright and let me put it on my business cards or sell it to Getty Images? Sure. But just to know I own one of 100 \"real\" copies that is now mine? Nope. I am 100% aware of the ridiculous double standard here, and I am not suggesting I'm correct. I'm saying it's where I'm at right now.\n\nEach card in a TopShot pack, or each piece of digital artwork on Rarible, OpenSea, or a dozen other platforms, is usually just a Smart Contract tied to the Ethereum network. (I wrote a bit about smart contracts last week, but in short, they take a bunch of business logic, embed it in a piece of publicly accessible code in the Ethereum blockchain, and run as cloud-computing applications using ETH as the way you pay for computing cycles. They're cool.)\n\nNFT's 'wrap' other objects inside their smart contracts. So for example, if you buy a piece of digital art, the literal image could be wrapped in the token (the ones and zeros that make the GIF), or more likely, the token wraps a digital key that in turn unlocks a much higher resolution version. Since the token itself can be moved around and interacted with, there's a cost to both how complex and how big the tokens can be in practice.\n\nWhat you put into an NFT is entirely about trust. The NBA is wrapping up MP4s (or keys to them) in the body of their NFT. Other artists are putting keys to unlock music. I went to Rarible last night and minted 5 Non-Fungible Tokens of my own. I used their point-and-click tools and did no programming whatsoever.\n\nSince I have no real talent, I decided the thing I would sell was an item of external trust. If you buy one of these tokens, all you own is my promise. And my promise is minted on the token: you can transfer the token back to me (which I will then destroy or resell), in return for me giving you one hour of my life.\n\n(I am not expecting anyone to buy these. I'm making a bit of a point here: you can wrap anything in a smart contract, as long as you have a trust bridge. In this case the trust bridge is my word. If you think I'm unreliable, my promise is worthless. If you think I'm a person of my word, then the token is actually worth one of the projected 700,000 hours of my life. But feel free to buy it if you like!)\n\nThe process was relatively simple, but it wasn't free. In order to mint these 5 tokens, I had to pay 'Gas' to mint my contracts and make them available for people to buy. Gas is the computational currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Minting my tokens meant I sent a set of code out to the blockchain. When some miner minted a new ETH block, my work was done (and I paid him, in Gas). My cost for this was about $40 at current ETH prices and the load of the network last night. To participate in this weirdness, I had to join the Crypto Notional economy. I had to purchase a little bit of ETH (which I did at Coinbase). Because I need a 'hard' wallet -- a specific address on the blockchain that my new NFT's belong to and are minted by -- I had to move my ETH from Coinbase over to Metamask (one of many web-based hard wallets). I could also have used a wallet on my phone, or even resorted to writing a long string on paper somewhere.\n\nOnce I spent some cash at Coinbase to get into the crypto side of the house, everything that happens with this token happens only in the Crypto Notional economy. If you want to buy one of my tokens (guaranteed only one of 700,000 it would be possible to make!), you're going to owe me an ETH (the minimum Rarible lets you mint a token for, I'm not that much of a egotist). How much this is worth to you, as a buyer, will depend on at least two things: how much you value Ethereum, and how much you value an hour of my time. It would be easy to say \"well, the first is just an exchange rate,\" but since we both now need ETH to interact, (and it's easy to imagine all the internety-things ETH could be used for), ETH has utility beyond its simple conversion back and forth to USD. It is itself a useful good required to buy computing cycles from the cloud to implement smart contracts.\n\nOne really cool and still somewhat nascent feature of smart contracts is the idea of an Oracle. An Oracle is an external provider of data to a smart contract. So for example, if you have a contract that pays out on who wins a presidential election, you could assign a specific Oracle to have the contract consult to determine who won (Associated Press, etc). The beauty of such a system is that you can have information enter the smart contract without any human involvement and without creating a giant bloated mass of a smart contract which would cost far too much gas to run.\n\nPut another way, an Oracle to a Smart Contract is simply a way of accessing a piece of intellectual property that lives OFF OF the blockchain - the state of an external data set. So what if a PM or an Index provider, instead of running money, simply provided an oracle: an API that any (approved, secured) system could talk to which told the requestor in real time what a given portfolio looks like: 4% AAPL, 2% TSLA, etc. (This is essentially what CRSP does right now in their partnership with Symbiont and Vanguard, but to my understanding, that's effectively a closed network, in the same way FedWire is. They just use blockchain for fault tolerance and efficiency.)\n\nSo this part is pretty well trod: baking portfolio IP into a blockchain. What's the next step? Getting paid.\n\nWhen you buy an NFT, you're not just buying whatever IP got wrapped up in the contract, you're also getting access to a whole set of business logic coded into the NFT. In the dominant standard for digital art, ETC-721, a standard for paying royalties exists (and is part of my NadigHour tokens). If you decide to sell my token to Elon Musk for $1 million in a decade because I discovered the secret to time travel and it's a collectible (I won't, and it won't be), 10% of that transaction will get funneled back to the same ETH address I used to mint the coins. That's really cool for, say, an artist who's actually selling copyrights.\n\nBut back to indexing: coding up a smart contract to access an oracle that happens to return the constituents of an index or portfolio is pretty much trivial, but so what? If we stopped right here, what we have is a really interesting way of getting IP into direct indexing accounts. After all, this could just power all my fractional share trades at OSAM's Canvas or whatever Schwab launches this year. That's just a fun new way of sending a spreadsheet, often, with a lot of security and transaction history.\n\nBut what if a new kind of ETF (call it the CryptoETF) could access this information as a Portfolio Token? For example, Matt's Index issues a Portfolio Token to the Dave's Large-Cap CryptoETF (cDAVE). It's a singular NFT -- it exists to create the connection between Matt's Index and the CryptoETF, and its precise terms could be negotiated. Whenever the CryptoETF wants to adjust its portfolio (could be once a day, could be every second), they access the functions of the smart contract that is part of the Portfolio Token. As part of that access, the CryptoETF presents evidence of AUM, and remits payment (based on daily AUM over time, just like now, perhaps) to Matt's Index (in a tokenized store of value, like a stable coin) in return for that instance of access. Baking in the appropriate business logic here is absolutely trivial. The programming language used for smart contracts, Solidity, is ludicrously straightforward for anyone who has ever learned JavaScript (which at this point should cover every programmer born since 1970).\n\nWhat's even cooler is if to imagine a world where the Fund Company side of this transaction exists entirely in the Crypto Notional economy. What if the fund itself was simply a set of cryptographic assets. Instead of own individual stocks, say, they could own tokenized stocks. This is effectively what happens over at FTX (U.S. investors need not apply). FTX runs an exchange where you can trade token pairs (I give you an apple, you give me an orange). In order to make the apples say, bitcoin, and the oranges, say, Tesla Stock, they partnered with a brokerage to essentially create a giant public dark pool. Everyone opens up dual accounts with both FTX and their Security-Notional brokerage partner, CM-Equity, and FTX allows members of the dark pool to trade these token pairs with each other, which are then mimicked in the dark pool being run by CM-Equity (essentially). Each each token, in a way, represents a share in the dark pool run by the Securities Notional partner, assigned to a certain exposure (say, a share of TSLA). It's far to complex and fraught with single-counterparty risks (my opinion, feel free to yell at me), but I get why they ended up this way. Regulators are terrified, so you have to play ball with securities laws.\n\nA far more efficient way to bridge this gap between the Security-Notional ownership of $TSLA stock and the tokenized Crypto-Notional version of TSLA would be to simply establish bridged liquidity pools. This is the topic for an entire different discussion, but essentially, the Uniswap model for managing liquidity in any pair of assets is quite elegant, and there's really no reason (other than regulation) you couldn't apply it to any single asset class.\n\nVery briefly, each notional tradable pair (say, a stable coin like USDT vs. TSLA stock) would exist as its own pool of both (some USDT and some TSLA) to create an 'Exposure Token', which is what gets traded. When it gets out of balance, prices change to create arbitrage opportunities. This is how Uniswap handles a swap between, say, Ethereum and Bitcoin:\n\n(I get that I'm shorthanding an *enormous* amount here and I apologize, but I encourage ops nerds like me to dig in. It's super cool, and embeds all sorts of economics, like paying liqudiity providers for showing up beyond just providing an arbitrage opportunity).\n\nRight now, such a bridge token would likely violate a whole pile of securities laws in the U.S. -- which is exactly what we need to fix. But lets hand-wave that. If the fund company could, instead of going and buying a bunch of stocks on the Security-Notional side of things, instead simply go and buy a bunch of Exposure Tokens on the Crypto-Notional side of things, the implications are profound:\n- A 'CryptoETF' simply becomes a collection of tokens.\n- The CryptoETF itself, now just a collection of tokens tied to an external Portfolio Token which contains the IP, can implement business logic, and itself be tokenized.\n- The CryptoETF token presents methods for automatically accessing creation and redemption -- n ew CryptoETF tokens are created or burned based using baskets of the appropriate Exposure Tokens (tokenized TSLA, tokenized gold, whatever), which could of course change at any time based on new information from the Portfolio Token.\n- Any changes to the portfolio of any kind can be 100% automated -- because all you're doing is swapping Exposure Tokens for Exposure Tokens. If the fund needs to sell some Apple and buy some Tesla, the business logic of the CryptoETF can just automatically make the paired transactions back to a decentralized exchange like Uniswap.\n- Since the CryptoETF is itself tokenized, it can be transferred through Decentralized Exchanges, presented as collateral, or just stored somewhere, all without any direct involvement of the current global securities infrastructure (that's up to the liquidity providers).\n\nMy 'aha' moment here is that all of the above is so trivial, technically. The entirety of this could be coded into Ethereum-based tokens in a weekend (by someone else, I'm tired) using existing tech. It's also 100% impossible in the current regulatory environment. These Exposure Tokens could naturally be regulated entities with any counterparty risks or structural issues backstopped by our good friends at the DTCC. While that might make crypto-evangelists break out into hives, any bridging to the Security-Notional economy is going to require a counterparty to at the very least act as custodian for the Security-Notional side of the tokens, until we actually get rid of stocks and bonds altogether and just issue ownership rights directly to a blockchain.\n\nAll this is what i meant when I said last week that the United States has a real opportunity to lead here. Really thoughtful regulatory environments could turn the United States into the de facto global capitalist engine for the next 50 years. The path we're on is one of almost complete neglect. A little poking around the edges of central bank digital currencies doesn't cut it.\n\nSo what's the to-do list? Build standards. Build a regulatory framework supporting those standards. Implement. That's how this always works. The crypto community should be working hand in hand with regulators to make this future, not in conflict with, but in collaboration with the traditional Security-Notional economy. And doing so would put the U.S. back conducting the train of global capitalism, instead of hanging out in the caboose.\n\n--\n\nA Postscript on Bitcoin: I'm a well documented Bitcoin skeptic, as I am of all psychological commodities. I am however becoming slightly less of one because of a single realization: Bitcoin, more than anything, is collateral. It's a crypto-native asset that is widely held, traded, and valued. That's why folks like FTX and Binance treat Bitcoin as nearly-cash when it comes to posting collateral into a trading account on which to earn interest or gain margin, although even there, everything is marked at a USD amount. You can build an ecosystem to get away from fiat currencies, but it's gonna be a whole 'nother matter to get away from a peg. \n\nFinal Note: Ideas are ephemeral and implementation is everything. If you're already doing all this, please let me know. I'm sorry I missed you in my google search. If you think this is a cool idea and you go build some giant thing around it, feel free to put me on your board or buy one of my tokens (grin).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n-

At this writing, ETH is hovering at $1,889, up more than 600% in the past 12 months. Put another way, the proverbial $1,000 invested in Ethereum last year would now be worth about $7,000.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Source: Shutterstock\n\n\nIn early February, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) introduced futures contracts in Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, which started in 2015 as a programmable blockchain. Such futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell Ether at a predetermined price at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace\u00a0contributor Vivian Medithi covered the topic earlier this month and highlighted, \u201cAnalysts expect to see increased institutional investment in ether as a result of the introduction of futures contracts, bolstering the recent bullish run in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s move comes about three years after its December 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures. At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon. So as a small allocation to a portfolio, it could be worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH building overhead pressure threatens losses to $1,200", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "43 minutes ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/REIeQHMAYcmTIXjf3ot2qQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bfcbe8c59e51f681a528c61f971e9894", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Ethereum made a remarkable recovery following the slump to $1,400 from highs above $2,000.

It is trading slightly above an ascending channel\u2019s lower boundary. Increasing selling pressure puts this support in jeopardy. Note that if broken, Ethereum would be vulnerable to losses eyeing $1,200.\n\nThe 4-hour chart vividly illustrates a bearish picture based on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). This indicator, when used accurately, can suggest positions for selling the top and buying the dip positions.\n\nEther is in a bearish trend, as reinforced by the MACD line (blue) crossing below the signal line. Besides, the wide divergence between the two lines shows that bears have more influence.\n\nIf Ethereum slices through the channel\u2019s resistance and fails to find support at the 50 Simple Moving Average, losses may extend to $1,400 and $1,200, respectively.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe IOMAP model by IntoTheBlock (ITB) cements the bears\u2019 influence over the price by revealing the massive resistance zone between $1,645 and $1,693.

Trading above this zone will not be a walk in the park; thus, recovery may take longer to materialize.\n\nOn the flip side, Ethereum is sitting on relatively weak support areas, in turn, adding credibility to the bearish notion. However, the model brings our attention to subtle buyer congestion between $1,550 and $1,596. Here, roughly 366,000 addresses are currently profiting from the approximately 2.4 million ETH bought in the zone. In other words, this support area is not strong enough to hold Ethereum for long.\n\n\n\nEthereum IOMAP chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s uptrend is in jeopardy, but not all is lost for the bulls. Holding above the ascending channel\u2019s lower edge will give buyers a chance to focus on levels at $1,700 and $2,000. Support at this level will also encourage the bulls hiding on the sidelines to return to the market and contribute to the impeding tailwind.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum (ETH/USD) Falls 26% From Historic High; What's Next?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "NewsBTC", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/uODCo_yIa2bSLAfW7hCVJQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3b47359ce0612a5c63c201d5d072d26f", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "12 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Price analysis 2/24: BTC, ETH, BNB, DOT, ADA, XRP, LTC, LINK, BCH, XLM", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Cointelegraph", "date": "10 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/qpqsZzc38vlWOCgsWhlp5g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/6c1beef72c65a65158e1f4fe019706f5", "auther": "Rakesh Upadhyay ", "body": "Institutional investors continue to pour money into the crypto sector even with the current dip below $45,000.

This takes the company\u2019s total holding to 90,531 Bitcoin.\n\nAnother company that bought Bitcoin during the current market correction is Square. The company said it had acquired roughly \u201c3,318 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million.\u201d\n\nThese purchases by institutional investors show they are bullish on the long-term prospects of Bitcoin and believe that it is a good buy near $50,000. \n\nWhile the institutional purchases are a bullish sign, traders must also remember that for every buyer, there is a seller. Glassnode data suggests that Bitcoin whales, holding between 1,000 Bitcoin to 10,000 Bitcoin and \u201chumpback whales\u201d holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin have sold more than 140,000 Bitcoin in February. \n\nIn the past, the whales swayed the crypto markets at their will. But the entry of institutional investors has reduced their dominance. Therefore, along with the whales, traders must also keep an eye on the institutional activity.\n\nWhile large investors can buy and hold for the long-term, the smaller investor would do well to buy at the right time to make the most of the limited available capital. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s pullback from the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,323) on Feb. 22 was greeted with aggressive selling on February 23. The bears dragged the price below the channel, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows buying at lower levels.\n\nThe buyers are currently attempting to keep the BTC/USD pair inside the channel. However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. \n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise. \n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.\n\nEven as Binance Coin\u2019s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to turn up from 71. \n\nThe score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB\u2019s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS\u2122score, BNB price started to rally from $201. \n\nThat was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price. After a brief dip, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to strengthen from 71 and reached 80 as the price recovered to $271 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. \n\nIf the price again turns down from the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.\n\nConversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969. \n\nThe long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT). \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS\u2122 score reached 82 when DOT\u2019s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS\u2122 score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24. \n\nDOT\u2019s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.\n\nA breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.\n\nThe bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.\n\nXRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.\n\nBuying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.\n\nThe next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.\n\nThe failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions. \n\nThe LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.\n\nIf the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.\n\nChainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.\n\nThe dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears. \n\nThe sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.\n\nIf the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23. \n\nThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The second-ranked crypto just set a new all-time high above $2,000.\n\nEthereum has broken a key psychological resistance barrier at $2,000.\n\nETH has crossed $2,000 for the first time. It\u2019s trading at $2,014 at the time of writing.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nThe digital asset has experienced a violent rise in recent weeks. On Jan. 4, it crossed $1,000 amid a flurry of activity across the crypto markets.\n\nThe run then intensified, with ETH touching $1,430 on Jan. 19, a record high at the time. ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run. ETH often outperforms BTC, however. It\u2019s up roughly 175% year-to-date, while BTC is up 89%.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has also had various wins of its own recently. On Feb. 8, ETH futures launched on CME Group, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange.\n\nThe NFT space, which runs on top of Ethereum, has also enjoyed a boom this year. Several notable celebrities and musicians have piled into the craze, among them Mark Cuban, Logan Paul, and Soulja Boy. This week, iconic auction house Christie\u2019s announced its plans to list an NFT by Beeple. They\u2019ll accept ETH in the auction.\n\nDeFi, meanwhile, continues to grow. There\u2019s over $43 billion locked in DeFi protocols today, according to DeFi Pulse. Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021. Described as an ETH buyback mechanism by EIP-1559 Tim Beiko, the update will see gas fees get burned to reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is now $232.8 billion.\n\nOriginal

Such futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell Ether at a predetermined price at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace\u00a0contributor Vivian Medithi covered the topic earlier this month and highlighted, \u201cAnalysts expect to see increased institutional investment in ether as a result of the introduction of futures contracts, bolstering the recent bullish run in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s move comes about three years after its December 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures. At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon. So as a small allocation to a portfolio, it could be worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH building overhead pressure threatens losses to $1,200", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "44 minutes ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/REIeQHMAYcmTIXjf3ot2qQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bfcbe8c59e51f681a528c61f971e9894", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Ethereum made a remarkable recovery following the slump to $1,400 from highs above $2,000.

Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Price analysis 2/24: BTC, ETH, BNB, DOT, ADA, XRP, LTC, LINK, BCH, XLM", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Cointelegraph", "date": "10 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/qpqsZzc38vlWOCgsWhlp5g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/6c1beef72c65a65158e1f4fe019706f5", "auther": "Rakesh Upadhyay ", "body": "Institutional investors continue to pour money into the crypto sector even with the current dip below $45,000. On Feb.24, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced that it had recently purchased over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) at an average rate of $52,765 per coin. This takes the company\u2019s total holding to 90,531 Bitcoin.\n\nAnother company that bought Bitcoin during the current market correction is Square. The company said it had acquired roughly \u201c3,318 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million.\u201d\n\nThese purchases by institutional investors show they are bullish on the long-term prospects of Bitcoin and believe that it is a good buy near $50,000. \n\nWhile the institutional purchases are a bullish sign, traders must also remember that for every buyer, there is a seller. Glassnode data suggests that Bitcoin whales, holding between 1,000 Bitcoin to 10,000 Bitcoin and \u201chumpback whales\u201d holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin have sold more than 140,000 Bitcoin in February. \n\nIn the past, the whales swayed the crypto markets at their will. But the entry of institutional investors has reduced their dominance. Therefore, along with the whales, traders must also keep an eye on the institutional activity.\n\nWhile large investors can buy and hold for the long-term, the smaller investor would do well to buy at the right time to make the most of the limited available capital. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s pullback from the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,323) on Feb. 22 was greeted with aggressive selling on February 23. The bears dragged the price below the channel, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows buying at lower levels.\n\nThe buyers are currently attempting to keep the BTC/USD pair inside the channel. However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. \n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise. \n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.\n\nEven as Binance Coin\u2019s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to turn up from 71. \n\nThe score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB\u2019s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS\u2122score, BNB price started to rally from $201. \n\nThat was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price. After a brief dip, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to strengthen from 71 and reached 80 as the price recovered to $271 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. \n\nIf the price again turns down from the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.\n\nConversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969. \n\nThe long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT). \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS\u2122 score reached 82 when DOT\u2019s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS\u2122 score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24. \n\nDOT\u2019s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.\n\nA breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.\n\nThe bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.\n\nXRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.\n\nBuying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.\n\nThe next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.\n\nThe failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions. \n\nThe LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.\n\nIf the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.\n\nChainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.\n\nThe dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears. \n\nThe sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.\n\nIf the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23. \n\nThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The second-ranked crypto just set a new all-time high above $2,000.\n\nEthereum has broken a key psychological resistance barrier at $2,000.\n\nETH has crossed $2,000 for the first time. It\u2019s trading at $2,014 at the time of writing.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nThe digital asset has experienced a violent rise in recent weeks. On Jan. 4, it crossed $1,000 amid a flurry of activity across the crypto markets.\n\nThe run then intensified, with ETH touching $1,430 on Jan. 19, a record high at the time. ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run. ETH often outperforms BTC, however. It\u2019s up roughly 175% year-to-date, while BTC is up 89%.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has also had various wins of its own recently. On Feb. 8, ETH futures launched on CME Group, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange.\n\nThe NFT space, which runs on top of Ethereum, has also enjoyed a boom this year. Several notable celebrities and musicians have piled into the craze, among them Mark Cuban, Logan Paul, and Soulja Boy. This week, iconic auction house Christie\u2019s announced its plans to list an NFT by Beeple. They\u2019ll accept ETH in the auction.\n\nDeFi, meanwhile, continues to grow. There\u2019s over $43 billion locked in DeFi protocols today, according to DeFi Pulse. Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021. Described as an ETH buyback mechanism by EIP-1559 Tim Beiko, the update will see gas fees get burned to reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is now $232.8 billion.\n\nOriginal

newest Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) upgrade, the network\u2019s largest overhaul since it went live on Ethereum in 2019, a blog post shared with CoinDesk claims. Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: Arcane Research: Banking on Bitcoin \u2013 The State of Bitcoin As Collateral\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nazarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei. Gas fees are currently at historic highs with an average transaction surpassing $40 Tuesday, according to Blockchair.\n\nRelated: US Central Bank Explains 'Preconditions' for a Digital Dollar\n\nNot only will the update lessen congestion on Ethereum, but it should decrease call latency, Nazarov said.\n\n\u201cReally what OCR does is take the computation we were doing on-chain and porting it out to an off-chain environment, and that is creating a very large 10x increase in efficiency, which means we can put a lot more data on-chain,\u201d Nazarov said.\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n"}, {"headline": "Two NYC bars are for sale \u2014 asking price is 25 bitcoin", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/pf.E1D0Bf9xAOkzuMDgcHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/62f05ae0-7302-11eb-bfbf-f3b92472ae90", "auther": "Alexis Christoforous", "body": "A long-time restaurant owner in New York City is looking to sell his two bars for bitcoin. Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD. And we see 2,342 to be the next target for ETH/USD for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Support Zone with $1775.00 Setting the Tone \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into .7916 \n-  NZD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Strengthens Over .7232, Weakens Under .7206 \n-  Stocks Move Higher Despite Rising Bond Yields \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n"}, {"headline": "4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: BA, DE, Litecoin, RCL", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace via Yahoo Finance", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/I_GHyyLeQaHlxgIMX3eotg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investorplace_417/13522e8441308910763ccbb76de3f676", "auther": "Bret Kenwell", "body": "It was an up-and-down session that\u2019s now mostly flat for the S&P 500.

And hide from these days we remained all alone. Staying in the same place, just staying out the time. Touching from a distance, Further all the time.\" Joy Division, Transmission\n\nOver the last few weeks I've been digging deep into my own assumptions about how the world works. I've seen enough cool stuff fly by to (occasionally) recognize when I should keep my mouth shut until I actually wade into a topic. That's largely how I've felt about Crypto. When Bitcoin took off about a decade ago, I did the obligatory amount of reading most nerds did, chuckled at all my Young Turk analysts buying Bitcoin for $49 or whatever it was at the time. I adopted the fashionable \"Tsk, Bitcoin, but Hrm, blockchain?\" stance that still pervades most of finance on the 'Security-Notional' side of the balance sheet -- the world of stocks and bonds and futures and options and all that jazz. I wasn't paying enough attention.\n\nI'm not writing this for all of you deep crypto nerds -- y'all are the ones I'm learning from. I fully expect y'all to:\n- Light me up over everything I've got wrong.\n- Point out the people and groups that already figured this out, but whom I couldn't find on Google this weekend.\n\nBut for the rest of you:\n\nLet's start by thinking about what the whole point of a mutual fund or ETF or SMA or CIT is to you as the investor. You move money from the Cash economy (where we actually accumulate and spend dollars) to the Security-Notional economy (where we own assets we mark to a \"price\") through a brokerage account. That's quite literally the point of your broker. They sit between the Cash Economy and the Security-Notional economy and help you transact in the later. You allocate money from your cash into, say, an ETF. That ETF is nothing more than a slice of intellectual property (IP), whether they come from MSCI as part of an index, or from Cathie Wood's team at ARK Invest. That IP is then implemented through trades in underlying securities, through in kind creations or by taking cash from an Authorized Participant, and dozens of other fun but shockingly complex bits of work happen under the hood to keep the portfolio trued up (corporate actions, splits, M&A, securities lending, etc.) You can imagine it a bit like this:\n\nSo what are you really paying for? Well, sometimes the IP involved is expensive, and unique (like, say, the active management of ARKK). Sometimes it's relatively simple and loaded with competition (like, say, MSCI's large cap U.S. Index). You as an investor should expect to pay accordingly. You're also paying for all the other stuff, but that tends to be relatively inexpensive. If your ETF is in U.S. stocks, you'd expect it to be cheap, but if its emerging market local currency debt with hedging overlays? Well, you'd expect to pay a bit more.\n\nLet's tease this out and try to imagine the most efficient way this could work. The actual IP here is trivial to package up. It's just a continuous broadcast of portfolio state, a carnival barker yelling \"STEP RIGHT UP AND SEE TODAY'S S&P 500.\" In the world of modern data, there's little difference between publishing that daily in the Wall St. Journal and building an API that a computer could poke at on demand to get constituents. Even the most active manager does essentially the same thing: they just say what the contents of the IP are, all the time.\n\nIn order to get paid for that IP, we've created all sorts of systems. Most involve you literally giving the money to the IP holder, and letting them handle the rest. If you want access to ARK, you can buy a mutual fund or an ETF, or if you're big enough, open up an SMA. But regardless, you move money across the notional barrier from your pile of cash into some Security-Notional vehicle, which ARK then manages. But what you're really looking for is the IP. Index providers get paid a little differently - they license their intellectual property to pretty much anyone, but the real money is in licensing it to fund managers who package it up into ETFs and funds of their own. They also license their IP to media, researchers, data providers, and so on.\n\nThe implementation part turns out to be relatively annoying. So much so that we've created all sorts of products to avoid it: index futures in particular were created to avoid the friction of implementation (among other things). So were 'synthetic ETFs' in Europe or Exchange-Traded Notes here in the U.S., and of course a huge chunk of the derivatives markets from swaps to structured notes. The IP is what matters. The implementation is just friction.\n\nThe New Hotness, in case you missed it, is 'Non-Fungible Tokens' or NFTs. The idea of an NFT is pretty simple: it's simply a digital blob that can't be duplicated, and it is one of a kind. This is distinct from Bitcoin, which are digital blobs of which there are currently 18 million. Yours is exactly as useful as mine. With an NFT, you make a one and done for each token. You can 'burn' it, but you can't change it, and it's unique. This the idea behind the widely popularized NBA TopShot digital collectible ... THINGS.\n\nA Sidebar for Nerds: I am hung up on digital objects having utility, and I'm trying to get past it. I have opened countless 'digital packs' of 'digital cards' that I paid real money for to play a game called Magic: The Gathering. Those fake things had real utility to me, because I enjoy playing a game that I can only play if I have those cards. I have absolutely no emotional attachment to my ownership of them. At the very same time, I don't, at my core, understand or appreciate the value of a piece of digital artwork which I could see in my browser right now for free, just because you tell me mine's 'official'. Give me copyright and let me put it on my business cards or sell it to Getty Images? Sure. But just to know I own one of 100 \"real\" copies that is now mine? Nope. I am 100% aware of the ridiculous double standard here, and I am not suggesting I'm correct. I'm saying it's where I'm at right now.\n\nEach card in a TopShot pack, or each piece of digital artwork on Rarible, OpenSea, or a dozen other platforms, is usually just a Smart Contract tied to the Ethereum network. (I wrote a bit about smart contracts last week, but in short, they take a bunch of business logic, embed it in a piece of publicly accessible code in the Ethereum blockchain, and run as cloud-computing applications using ETH as the way you pay for computing cycles. They're cool.)\n\nNFT's 'wrap' other objects inside their smart contracts. So for example, if you buy a piece of digital art, the literal image could be wrapped in the token (the ones and zeros that make the GIF), or more likely, the token wraps a digital key that in turn unlocks a much higher resolution version. Since the token itself can be moved around and interacted with, there's a cost to both how complex and how big the tokens can be in practice.\n\nWhat you put into an NFT is entirely about trust. The NBA is wrapping up MP4s (or keys to them) in the body of their NFT. Other artists are putting keys to unlock music. I went to Rarible last night and minted 5 Non-Fungible Tokens of my own. I used their point-and-click tools and did no programming whatsoever.\n\nSince I have no real talent, I decided the thing I would sell was an item of external trust. If you buy one of these tokens, all you own is my promise. And my promise is minted on the token: you can transfer the token back to me (which I will then destroy or resell), in return for me giving you one hour of my life.\n\n(I am not expecting anyone to buy these. I'm making a bit of a point here: you can wrap anything in a smart contract, as long as you have a trust bridge. In this case the trust bridge is my word. If you think I'm unreliable, my promise is worthless. If you think I'm a person of my word, then the token is actually worth one of the projected 700,000 hours of my life. But feel free to buy it if you like!)\n\nThe process was relatively simple, but it wasn't free. In order to mint these 5 tokens, I had to pay 'Gas' to mint my contracts and make them available for people to buy. Gas is the computational currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Minting my tokens meant I sent a set of code out to the blockchain. When some miner minted a new ETH block, my work was done (and I paid him, in Gas). My cost for this was about $40 at current ETH prices and the load of the network last night. To participate in this weirdness, I had to join the Crypto Notional economy. I had to purchase a little bit of ETH (which I did at Coinbase). Because I need a 'hard' wallet -- a specific address on the blockchain that my new NFT's belong to and are minted by -- I had to move my ETH from Coinbase over to Metamask (one of many web-based hard wallets). I could also have used a wallet on my phone, or even resorted to writing a long string on paper somewhere.\n\nOnce I spent some cash at Coinbase to get into the crypto side of the house, everything that happens with this token happens only in the Crypto Notional economy. If you want to buy one of my tokens (guaranteed only one of 700,000 it would be possible to make!), you're going to owe me an ETH (the minimum Rarible lets you mint a token for, I'm not that much of a egotist). How much this is worth to you, as a buyer, will depend on at least two things: how much you value Ethereum, and how much you value an hour of my time. It would be easy to say \"well, the first is just an exchange rate,\" but since we both now need ETH to interact, (and it's easy to imagine all the internety-things ETH could be used for), ETH has utility beyond its simple conversion back and forth to USD. It is itself a useful good required to buy computing cycles from the cloud to implement smart contracts.\n\nOne really cool and still somewhat nascent feature of smart contracts is the idea of an Oracle. An Oracle is an external provider of data to a smart contract. So for example, if you have a contract that pays out on who wins a presidential election, you could assign a specific Oracle to have the contract consult to determine who won (Associated Press, etc). The beauty of such a system is that you can have information enter the smart contract without any human involvement and without creating a giant bloated mass of a smart contract which would cost far too much gas to run.\n\nPut another way, an Oracle to a Smart Contract is simply a way of accessing a piece of intellectual property that lives OFF OF the blockchain - the state of an external data set. So what if a PM or an Index provider, instead of running money, simply provided an oracle: an API that any (approved, secured) system could talk to which told the requestor in real time what a given portfolio looks like: 4% AAPL, 2% TSLA, etc. (This is essentially what CRSP does right now in their partnership with Symbiont and Vanguard, but to my understanding, that's effectively a closed network, in the same way FedWire is. They just use blockchain for fault tolerance and efficiency.)\n\nSo this part is pretty well trod: baking portfolio IP into a blockchain. What's the next step? Getting paid.\n\nWhen you buy an NFT, you're not just buying whatever IP got wrapped up in the contract, you're also getting access to a whole set of business logic coded into the NFT. In the dominant standard for digital art, ETC-721, a standard for paying royalties exists (and is part of my NadigHour tokens). If you decide to sell my token to Elon Musk for $1 million in a decade because I discovered the secret to time travel and it's a collectible (I won't, and it won't be), 10% of that transaction will get funneled back to the same ETH address I used to mint the coins. That's really cool for, say, an artist who's actually selling copyrights.\n\nBut back to indexing: coding up a smart contract to access an oracle that happens to return the constituents of an index or portfolio is pretty much trivial, but so what? If we stopped right here, what we have is a really interesting way of getting IP into direct indexing accounts. After all, this could just power all my fractional share trades at OSAM's Canvas or whatever Schwab launches this year. That's just a fun new way of sending a spreadsheet, often, with a lot of security and transaction history.\n\nBut what if a new kind of ETF (call it the CryptoETF) could access this information as a Portfolio Token? For example, Matt's Index issues a Portfolio Token to the Dave's Large-Cap CryptoETF (cDAVE). It's a singular NFT -- it exists to create the connection between Matt's Index and the CryptoETF, and its precise terms could be negotiated. Whenever the CryptoETF wants to adjust its portfolio (could be once a day, could be every second), they access the functions of the smart contract that is part of the Portfolio Token. As part of that access, the CryptoETF presents evidence of AUM, and remits payment (based on daily AUM over time, just like now, perhaps) to Matt's Index (in a tokenized store of value, like a stable coin) in return for that instance of access. Baking in the appropriate business logic here is absolutely trivial. The programming language used for smart contracts, Solidity, is ludicrously straightforward for anyone who has ever learned JavaScript (which at this point should cover every programmer born since 1970).\n\nWhat's even cooler is if to imagine a world where the Fund Company side of this transaction exists entirely in the Crypto Notional economy. What if the fund itself was simply a set of cryptographic assets. Instead of own individual stocks, say, they could own tokenized stocks. This is effectively what happens over at FTX (U.S. investors need not apply). FTX runs an exchange where you can trade token pairs (I give you an apple, you give me an orange). In order to make the apples say, bitcoin, and the oranges, say, Tesla Stock, they partnered with a brokerage to essentially create a giant public dark pool. Everyone opens up dual accounts with both FTX and their Security-Notional brokerage partner, CM-Equity, and FTX allows members of the dark pool to trade these token pairs with each other, which are then mimicked in the dark pool being run by CM-Equity (essentially). Each each token, in a way, represents a share in the dark pool run by the Securities Notional partner, assigned to a certain exposure (say, a share of TSLA). It's far to complex and fraught with single-counterparty risks (my opinion, feel free to yell at me), but I get why they ended up this way. Regulators are terrified, so you have to play ball with securities laws.\n\nA far more efficient way to bridge this gap between the Security-Notional ownership of $TSLA stock and the tokenized Crypto-Notional version of TSLA would be to simply establish bridged liquidity pools. This is the topic for an entire different discussion, but essentially, the Uniswap model for managing liquidity in any pair of assets is quite elegant, and there's really no reason (other than regulation) you couldn't apply it to any single asset class.\n\nVery briefly, each notional tradable pair (say, a stable coin like USDT vs. TSLA stock) would exist as its own pool of both (some USDT and some TSLA) to create an 'Exposure Token', which is what gets traded. When it gets out of balance, prices change to create arbitrage opportunities. This is how Uniswap handles a swap between, say, Ethereum and Bitcoin:\n\n(I get that I'm shorthanding an *enormous* amount here and I apologize, but I encourage ops nerds like me to dig in. It's super cool, and embeds all sorts of economics, like paying liqudiity providers for showing up beyond just providing an arbitrage opportunity).\n\nRight now, such a bridge token would likely violate a whole pile of securities laws in the U.S. -- which is exactly what we need to fix. But lets hand-wave that. If the fund company could, instead of going and buying a bunch of stocks on the Security-Notional side of things, instead simply go and buy a bunch of Exposure Tokens on the Crypto-Notional side of things, the implications are profound:\n- A 'CryptoETF' simply becomes a collection of tokens.\n- The CryptoETF itself, now just a collection of tokens tied to an external Portfolio Token which contains the IP, can implement business logic, and itself be tokenized.\n- The CryptoETF token presents methods for automatically accessing creation and redemption -- n ew CryptoETF tokens are created or burned based using baskets of the appropriate Exposure Tokens (tokenized TSLA, tokenized gold, whatever), which could of course change at any time based on new information from the Portfolio Token.\n- Any changes to the portfolio of any kind can be 100% automated -- because all you're doing is swapping Exposure Tokens for Exposure Tokens. If the fund needs to sell some Apple and buy some Tesla, the business logic of the CryptoETF can just automatically make the paired transactions back to a decentralized exchange like Uniswap.\n- Since the CryptoETF is itself tokenized, it can be transferred through Decentralized Exchanges, presented as collateral, or just stored somewhere, all without any direct involvement of the current global securities infrastructure (that's up to the liquidity providers).\n\nMy 'aha' moment here is that all of the above is so trivial, technically. The entirety of this could be coded into Ethereum-based tokens in a weekend (by someone else, I'm tired) using existing tech. It's also 100% impossible in the current regulatory environment. These Exposure Tokens could naturally be regulated entities with any counterparty risks or structural issues backstopped by our good friends at the DTCC. While that might make crypto-evangelists break out into hives, any bridging to the Security-Notional economy is going to require a counterparty to at the very least act as custodian for the Security-Notional side of the tokens, until we actually get rid of stocks and bonds altogether and just issue ownership rights directly to a blockchain.\n\nAll this is what i meant when I said last week that the United States has a real opportunity to lead here. Really thoughtful regulatory environments could turn the United States into the de facto global capitalist engine for the next 50 years. The path we're on is one of almost complete neglect. A little poking around the edges of central bank digital currencies doesn't cut it.\n\nSo what's the to-do list? Build standards. Build a regulatory framework supporting those standards. Implement. That's how this always works. The crypto community should be working hand in hand with regulators to make this future, not in conflict with, but in collaboration with the traditional Security-Notional economy. And doing so would put the U.S. back conducting the train of global capitalism, instead of hanging out in the caboose.\n\n--\n\nA Postscript on Bitcoin: I'm a well documented Bitcoin skeptic, as I am of all psychological commodities. I am however becoming slightly less of one because of a single realization: Bitcoin, more than anything, is collateral. It's a crypto-native asset that is widely held, traded, and valued. That's why folks like FTX and Binance treat Bitcoin as nearly-cash when it comes to posting collateral into a trading account on which to earn interest or gain margin, although even there, everything is marked at a USD amount. You can build an ecosystem to get away from fiat currencies, but it's gonna be a whole 'nother matter to get away from a peg. \n\nFinal Note: Ideas are ephemeral and implementation is everything. If you're already doing all this, please let me know. I'm sorry I missed you in my google search. If you think this is a cool idea and you go build some giant thing around it, feel free to put me on your board or buy one of my tokens (grin).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n-

At this writing, ETH is hovering at $1,889, up more than 600% in the past 12 months. Put another way, the proverbial $1,000 invested in Ethereum last year would now be worth about $7,000.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Source: Shutterstock\n\n\nIn early February, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) introduced futures contracts in Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, which started in 2015 as a programmable blockchain. Such futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell Ether at a predetermined price at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace\u00a0contributor Vivian Medithi covered the topic earlier this month and highlighted, \u201cAnalysts expect to see increased institutional investment in ether as a result of the introduction of futures contracts, bolstering the recent bullish run in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s move comes about three years after its December 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures. At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon. So as a small allocation to a portfolio, it could be worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH building overhead pressure threatens losses to $1,200", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "44 minutes ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/REIeQHMAYcmTIXjf3ot2qQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bfcbe8c59e51f681a528c61f971e9894", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Ethereum made a remarkable recovery following the slump to $1,400 from highs above $2,000. The dip allowed investors to join the market at a lower price, anticipating a quick rise back to the new all-time highs of $2,040\u2014a barrier at $1,700 cut short the gains, forcing Ether to see refuge at $1,600.\n\nEther is dancing at $1,608 at the time of writing. It is trading slightly above an ascending channel\u2019s lower boundary. Increasing selling pressure puts this support in jeopardy. Note that if broken, Ethereum would be vulnerable to losses eyeing $1,200.\n\nThe 4-hour chart vividly illustrates a bearish picture based on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). This indicator, when used accurately, can suggest positions for selling the top and buying the dip positions.\n\nEther is in a bearish trend, as reinforced by the MACD line (blue) crossing below the signal line. Besides, the wide divergence between the two lines shows that bears have more influence.\n\nIf Ethereum slices through the channel\u2019s resistance and fails to find support at the 50 Simple Moving Average, losses may extend to $1,400 and $1,200, respectively.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe IOMAP model by IntoTheBlock (ITB) cements the bears\u2019 influence over the price by revealing the massive resistance zone between $1,645 and $1,693. In this range, nearly 374,000 addresses had previously bought approximately 8 million ETH. Trading above this zone will not be a walk in the park; thus, recovery may take longer to materialize.\n\nOn the flip side, Ethereum is sitting on relatively weak support areas, in turn, adding credibility to the bearish notion. However, the model brings our attention to subtle buyer congestion between $1,550 and $1,596. Here, roughly 366,000 addresses are currently profiting from the approximately 2.4 million ETH bought in the zone. In other words, this support area is not strong enough to hold Ethereum for long.\n\n\n\nEthereum IOMAP chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s uptrend is in jeopardy, but not all is lost for the bulls. Holding above the ascending channel\u2019s lower edge will give buyers a chance to focus on levels at $1,700 and $2,000. Support at this level will also encourage the bulls hiding on the sidelines to return to the market and contribute to the impeding tailwind.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum (ETH/USD) Falls 26% From Historic High; What's Next?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "NewsBTC", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/uODCo_yIa2bSLAfW7hCVJQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3b47359ce0612a5c63c201d5d072d26f", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "12 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Price analysis 2/24: BTC, ETH, BNB, DOT, ADA, XRP, LTC, LINK, BCH, XLM", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Cointelegraph", "date": "10 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/qpqsZzc38vlWOCgsWhlp5g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/6c1beef72c65a65158e1f4fe019706f5", "auther": "Rakesh Upadhyay ", "body": "Institutional investors continue to pour money into the crypto sector even with the current dip below $45,000. On Feb.24, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced that it had recently purchased over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) at an average rate of $52,765 per coin. This takes the company\u2019s total holding to 90,531 Bitcoin.\n\nAnother company that bought Bitcoin during the current market correction is Square. The company said it had acquired roughly \u201c3,318 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million.\u201d\n\nThese purchases by institutional investors show they are bullish on the long-term prospects of Bitcoin and believe that it is a good buy near $50,000. \n\nWhile the institutional purchases are a bullish sign, traders must also remember that for every buyer, there is a seller. Glassnode data suggests that Bitcoin whales, holding between 1,000 Bitcoin to 10,000 Bitcoin and \u201chumpback whales\u201d holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin have sold more than 140,000 Bitcoin in February. \n\nIn the past, the whales swayed the crypto markets at their will. But the entry of institutional investors has reduced their dominance. Therefore, along with the whales, traders must also keep an eye on the institutional activity.\n\nWhile large investors can buy and hold for the long-term, the smaller investor would do well to buy at the right time to make the most of the limited available capital. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s pullback from the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,323) on Feb. 22 was greeted with aggressive selling on February 23. The bears dragged the price below the channel, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows buying at lower levels.\n\nThe buyers are currently attempting to keep the BTC/USD pair inside the channel. However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. \n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise. \n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.\n\nEven as Binance Coin\u2019s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to turn up from 71. \n\nThe score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB\u2019s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS\u2122score, BNB price started to rally from $201. \n\nThat was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price. After a brief dip, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to strengthen from 71 and reached 80 as the price recovered to $271 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. \n\nIf the price again turns down from the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.\n\nConversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969. \n\nThe long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT). \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS\u2122 score reached 82 when DOT\u2019s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS\u2122 score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24. \n\nDOT\u2019s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.\n\nA breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.\n\nThe bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.\n\nXRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.\n\nBuying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.\n\nThe next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.\n\nThe failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions. \n\nThe LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.\n\nIf the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.\n\nChainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.\n\nThe dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears. \n\nThe sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.\n\nIf the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23. \n\nThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The second-ranked crypto just set a new all-time high above $2,000.\n\nEthereum has broken a key psychological resistance barrier at $2,000.\n\nETH has crossed $2,000 for the first time. It\u2019s trading at $2,014 at the time of writing.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nThe digital asset has experienced a violent rise in recent weeks. On Jan. 4, it crossed $1,000 amid a flurry of activity across the crypto markets.\n\nThe run then intensified, with ETH touching $1,430 on Jan. 19, a record high at the time. ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run. ETH often outperforms BTC, however. It\u2019s up roughly 175% year-to-date, while BTC is up 89%.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has also had various wins of its own recently. On Feb. 8, ETH futures launched on CME Group, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange.\n\nThe NFT space, which runs on top of Ethereum, has also enjoyed a boom this year. Several notable celebrities and musicians have piled into the craze, among them Mark Cuban, Logan Paul, and Soulja Boy. This week, iconic auction house Christie\u2019s announced its plans to list an NFT by Beeple. They\u2019ll accept ETH in the auction.\n\nDeFi, meanwhile, continues to grow. There\u2019s over $43 billion locked in DeFi protocols today, according to DeFi Pulse. Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021. Described as an ETH buyback mechanism by EIP-1559 Tim Beiko, the update will see gas fees get burned to reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is now $232.8 billion.\n\nOriginal

At this writing, ETH is hovering at $1,889, up more than 600% in the past 12 months. Put another way, the proverbial $1,000 invested in Ethereum last year would now be worth about $7,000.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Source: Shutterstock\n\n\nIn early February, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) introduced futures contracts in Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, which started in 2015 as a programmable blockchain. Such futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell Ether at a predetermined price at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace\u00a0contributor Vivian Medithi covered the topic earlier this month and highlighted, \u201cAnalysts expect to see increased institutional investment in ether as a result of the introduction of futures contracts, bolstering the recent bullish run in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s move comes about three years after its December 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures. At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon. So as a small allocation to a portfolio, it could be worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin. Look for Ethereum to continue to outperform Bitcoin over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH building overhead pressure threatens losses to $1,200", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "45 minutes ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/REIeQHMAYcmTIXjf3ot2qQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bfcbe8c59e51f681a528c61f971e9894", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Ethereum made a remarkable recovery following the slump to $1,400 from highs above $2,000.

It is trading slightly above an ascending channel\u2019s lower boundary. Increasing selling pressure puts this support in jeopardy. Note that if broken, Ethereum would be vulnerable to losses eyeing $1,200.\n\nThe 4-hour chart vividly illustrates a bearish picture based on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). This indicator, when used accurately, can suggest positions for selling the top and buying the dip positions.\n\nEther is in a bearish trend, as reinforced by the MACD line (blue) crossing below the signal line. Besides, the wide divergence between the two lines shows that bears have more influence.\n\nIf Ethereum slices through the channel\u2019s resistance and fails to find support at the 50 Simple Moving Average, losses may extend to $1,400 and $1,200, respectively.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe IOMAP model by IntoTheBlock (ITB) cements the bears\u2019 influence over the price by revealing the massive resistance zone between $1,645 and $1,693. In this range, nearly 374,000 addresses had previously bought approximately 8 million ETH. Trading above this zone will not be a walk in the park; thus, recovery may take longer to materialize.\n\nOn the flip side, Ethereum is sitting on relatively weak support areas, in turn, adding credibility to the bearish notion. However, the model brings our attention to subtle buyer congestion between $1,550 and $1,596. Here, roughly 366,000 addresses are currently profiting from the approximately 2.4 million ETH bought in the zone. In other words, this support area is not strong enough to hold Ethereum for long.\n\n\n\nEthereum IOMAP chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s uptrend is in jeopardy, but not all is lost for the bulls. Holding above the ascending channel\u2019s lower edge will give buyers a chance to focus on levels at $1,700 and $2,000. Support at this level will also encourage the bulls hiding on the sidelines to return to the market and contribute to the impeding tailwind.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum (ETH/USD) Falls 26% From Historic High; What's Next?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "NewsBTC", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/uODCo_yIa2bSLAfW7hCVJQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3b47359ce0612a5c63c201d5d072d26f", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "12 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Price analysis 2/24: BTC, ETH, BNB, DOT, ADA, XRP, LTC, LINK, BCH, XLM", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Cointelegraph", "date": "10 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/qpqsZzc38vlWOCgsWhlp5g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/6c1beef72c65a65158e1f4fe019706f5", "auther": "Rakesh Upadhyay ", "body": "Institutional investors continue to pour money into the crypto sector even with the current dip below $45,000. On Feb.24, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced that it had recently purchased over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) at an average rate of $52,765 per coin. This takes the company\u2019s total holding to 90,531 Bitcoin.\n\nAnother company that bought Bitcoin during the current market correction is Square. The company said it had acquired roughly \u201c3,318 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million.\u201d\n\nThese purchases by institutional investors show they are bullish on the long-term prospects of Bitcoin and believe that it is a good buy near $50,000. \n\nWhile the institutional purchases are a bullish sign, traders must also remember that for every buyer, there is a seller. Glassnode data suggests that Bitcoin whales, holding between 1,000 Bitcoin to 10,000 Bitcoin and \u201chumpback whales\u201d holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin have sold more than 140,000 Bitcoin in February. \n\nIn the past, the whales swayed the crypto markets at their will. But the entry of institutional investors has reduced their dominance. Therefore, along with the whales, traders must also keep an eye on the institutional activity.\n\nWhile large investors can buy and hold for the long-term, the smaller investor would do well to buy at the right time to make the most of the limited available capital. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s pullback from the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,323) on Feb. 22 was greeted with aggressive selling on February 23. The bears dragged the price below the channel, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows buying at lower levels.\n\nThe buyers are currently attempting to keep the BTC/USD pair inside the channel. However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. \n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise. \n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.\n\nEven as Binance Coin\u2019s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to turn up from 71. \n\nThe score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB\u2019s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS\u2122score, BNB price started to rally from $201. \n\nThat was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price. After a brief dip, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to strengthen from 71 and reached 80 as the price recovered to $271 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. \n\nIf the price again turns down from the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.\n\nConversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969. \n\nThe long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT). \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS\u2122 score reached 82 when DOT\u2019s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS\u2122 score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24. \n\nDOT\u2019s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.\n\nA breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.\n\nThe bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.\n\nXRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.\n\nBuying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.\n\nThe next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.\n\nThe failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions. \n\nThe LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.\n\nIf the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.\n\nChainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.\n\nThe dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears. \n\nThe sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.\n\nIf the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23. \n\nThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The second-ranked crypto just set a new all-time high above $2,000.\n\nEthereum has broken a key psychological resistance barrier at $2,000.\n\nETH has crossed $2,000 for the first time. It\u2019s trading at $2,014 at the time of writing.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nThe digital asset has experienced a violent rise in recent weeks. On Jan. 4, it crossed $1,000 amid a flurry of activity across the crypto markets.\n\nThe run then intensified, with ETH touching $1,430 on Jan. 19, a record high at the time. ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run. ETH often outperforms BTC, however. It\u2019s up roughly 175% year-to-date, while BTC is up 89%.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has also had various wins of its own recently. On Feb. 8, ETH futures launched on CME Group, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange.\n\nThe NFT space, which runs on top of Ethereum, has also enjoyed a boom this year. Several notable celebrities and musicians have piled into the craze, among them Mark Cuban, Logan Paul, and Soulja Boy. This week, iconic auction house Christie\u2019s announced its plans to list an NFT by Beeple. They\u2019ll accept ETH in the auction.\n\nDeFi, meanwhile, continues to grow. There\u2019s over $43 billion locked in DeFi protocols today, according to DeFi Pulse. Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021. Described as an ETH buyback mechanism by EIP-1559 Tim Beiko, the update will see gas fees get burned to reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is now $232.8 billion.\n\nOriginal Post\n"}]}]
