Ask them about cryptocurrency predictions for 2021. As Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), XRP (CCC:XRP-USD) and others have rocketed in value, never before has Wall Street seemed so hesitant about \u201cdigital gold,\u201d a name they use to invoke a margin of safety.\n\nBut as any experienced crypto investor knows, that\u2019s not the way cryptocurrencies work. Instead, it\u2019s a digital popularity contest where winners keep winning and losers bite the dust.\n\nSo, which cryptocurrencies can make you rich in 2021?\n\nTo answer that question, we need to explore the world of altcoins \u2014 up-and-coming coins that you can buy for cheap. That\u2019s because it pays to get in early. For example, $1,000 invested in Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) would be worth $3.3 million today. Meanwhile, $1,000 invested in Bitcoin today might earn \u201cjust\u201d 4-5x upside if you believe JP Morgan\u2019s lofty $146,000 target price.\n\nBut there are also significant risks because cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. Instead, their worth comes from their users. The more users a coin has, the more useful it becomes, and the higher its price goes. But when a coin falls out of favor, there\u2019s nothing to stop it from going to zero. That means investing in cryptocurrency requires strong belief that others will eventually buy it from you for even more.\n\nToday, people invest in crypto for one reason alone: to make money. So far, cryptocurrencies have delivered on that promise. Mom-and-pop investors have profited handsomely as Bitcoin and other currencies have rocketed in value.\n\nBut the risks in 2021 are growing \u2014 at their core, cryptocurrencies only serve to transfer wealth from one party to another. And some new competitors have recently popped up.\n\n\u201cChina has already developed a Central Bank-backed crypto, and in the U.S. it was discussed as part of the C-19 stimulus,\u201d writes Laura Gonzalez, Ph.D., associate professor of Finance at California State University, Long Beach. \u201cThere is ample evidence of speculation as well, and the value of the current cryptos will be affected by the upcoming central-bank backed digital currencies.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unregulated cryptocurrencies will one day compete against state-sponsored ones too.\n\nHere\u2019s the takeaway: if you have an extremely conservative portfolio and need to add \u201crisk-on\u201d assets, choosing a basket of top-rated cryptocurrencies could be right for you. It\u2019s a cheap way to gain massive macroeconomic risk exposure. But don\u2019t get fooled by thinking of crypto as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d If 2021 sees a surprise economic slowdown, no amount of hope will keep crypto afloat.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to take those risks, then you might want to start your search with the top 28 cryptocurrencies you need to know for 2021:\n\nWhile each has enormous potential, some are safer bets than others. As such, I\u2019ve organized the cryptocurrencies based on their overall risk-to-reward potential from most balanced to least. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at the wild world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum is a relative newcomer that has risen up the ranks thanks to its superior technology and its ability to create \u201csmart contracts.\u201d\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $200 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: $102020 Return: 470%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nEther, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is a technologically advanced version of Bitcoin that stands to grow even faster. Rather than hold itself as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d Ethereum runs on a series of contracts. That makes it more like Google Wallet or Apple Pay \u2014 a system that can approve or delay transactions based on real-world events. Online buyers and sellers, for instance, could set up trades that only follow through when the postal service independently verifies the delivery of goods.\n\nEthereum is also blazingly fast compared to Bitcoin: transactions only take 15 seconds to clear, rather than 15 minutes. Although trading costs are still high, its speed makes Ethereum useful for real-time use, rather than only as a store of value. Finally, Ethereum also has widespread adoption, with over 600,000 wallet addresses in use. As developers add services and protocols to make cryptocurrencies more useful, Ethereum looks set to keep winning.\n\nThese qualities have pushed Ethereum to my No. 1 spot in terms of risk-to-reward potential. Despite it having a later start than many other currencies, it has a winning combination of widespread usage, technological superiority and relative safety (compared to smaller coins, at least).\n\nBitcoin is the most widely adopted cryptocurrency. Although it\u2019s not the most technologically advanced, it continues to lead the pack.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $920 billionYear Established: 2009Cost Per Transaction: $152020 Return: 309%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe first successful cryptocurrency continues to lead the pack. With its first-mover advantage, Bitcoin not only won early name recognition. It also became the de-facto cryptocurrency for mainstream investors. Smaller investors can use Square (NYSE:SQ) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) services to buy as little as $1 (or as much as they can \u201chodl\u201d). Meanwhile, institutional investors can use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to transact millions of dollars in futures.\n\nThat makes Bitcoin an essential allocation. The world\u2019s No. 1 coin makes up close to two-thirds of the entire cryptocurrency market, providing liquidity between smaller altcoins. Its size also makes it resistant to 51% attacks, where large cryptocurrency miners attempt to use computing heft to try manipulating the blockchain.\n\nHowever, popular as it may be, Bitcoin has some downsides. As one of the earliest blockchains, Bitcoin\u2019s ledger is large and unwieldy. Transactions can cost $12 to complete and take over 15 minutes to clear. That\u2019s fine for its purpose as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d but it prevents BTC from use as a day-to-day currency. (People paying in Bitcoin will often use third-party services to transact small amounts).\n\nBitcoin is also extremely sensitive to macroeconomic movements \u2014 the currency lost half its value in the most recent U.S. stock market downturn. And if 2021 reveals a weak economic recovery or mutated strain of the novel coronavirus, Bitcoin could easily lose 50-80% of its value. But for those looking to invest in cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the most liquid option. It\u2019s an essential coin to hold, and one that receives top marks for in 2021.\n\nXRP is a centralized cryptocurrency that\u2019s geared toward taking out the high costs of inter-bank transfers.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $24 billionYear Established: 2012Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 16%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIf you could only bet on one cryptocurrency this year, XRP would be it. XRP is the largest currency to have 10x potential for 2021.\n\nXRP is the odd duckling of the cryptocurrency world. Founded by Ripple Labs, XRP is a centralized currency that\u2019s mined, managed and administered by Ripple Labs (instead of a broad-based community). On one hand, that gives the coin the benefits of Visa (NYSE:V) and other centralized payments processors. These include the ability to negotiate with large banks, execute trades quickly and control policies.\n\nOn the other hand, critics are right to question: \u201cWhy use a cryptocurrency in the first place then?\u201d\n\nXRP has also had its share of accounting issues. Specifically, in December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and two executives for selling XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Ripple also controls over half of the XRP supply.\n\nStill, XRP has enormous potential. The currency is used by financial institutions as an alternative to the SWIFT network, giving it a real-world application. And its low price-per-coin makes it a tempting target for punters \u2014 it\u2019s easier to see XRP rising 1,000% to $3.5 than BTC doing the same to $454,000.\n\nA well-placed contender to XRP\u2019s crown, Stellar offers low-cost, cross-border transactions.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $11 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 189%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n2021 is shaping to become Stellar\u2019s year. After lagging Bitcoin in 2020, Stellar surprised analysts and investors alike by rocketing 200% in the first week of January. The coin has continued to outperform expectations since.\n\nMuch of its success comes from XRP\u2019s misfortunes. Much like XRP, Stellar was designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. As regulatory issues mount for rival XRP, Stellar has quickly moved to fill the void. But some of it has also come down to luck. In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowed banks to start using independent node verification networks. The same week, the Ukrainian government announced a partnership with Stellar Development to create a national digital currency.\n\nAll this grants perfect investment conditions for Stellar, a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nCardano is the largest third-generation cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s packed with plenty more upside potential in 2021.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 441%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nADA, which runs on the Cardano network is one of the most technologically exciting cryptocurrencies to date. Its proof-of-stake system means it can operate more efficiently than the standard proof-of-work system. And its use of smart contracts means that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum. In short, it\u2019s a third-generation coin that improves on its predecessors.\n\nADA/Cardano still has plenty of work to do in the year ahead. After all, having a superior technological product means nothing if people won\u2019t adopt it. But three key areas make it a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nFirst, ADA has momentum. The currency took just three years to hit a $10 billion market cap \u2014 one-third the time it took Bitcoin to do the same. Second, it sits at just 30 cents per coin, making it a tempting target for punters to run up. Finally, it has the ability to handle transactions and smart contracts. This makes it a natural enhancement for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nAn internet meme turned cryptocurrency, Dogecoin teaches the world about making money.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $7 billionYear Established: 2013Cost Per Transaction: 3 cents2020 Return: 118%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2013, IBM (NYSE:IBM) software engineer Billy Markus founded Dogecoin as a meme joke. And like most memes, Dogecoin saw its 15 minutes of fame. In 2017, DOGE briefly rocketed 85,000% as the internet found its new amusement; it subsequently lost 98% of its value.\n\nBut in the world of cryptocurrencies and memes alike, second acts DO exist. In December 2020, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sent Dogecoin back up 200% in a week simply by tweeting about it. As 2021 rolls around, this newfound popularity could send the coin up to speculative heights. Dogecoin does have its merits: its faster block time makes it better at processing payments than Bitcoin can. But in an asset class where popularity trounces usability any day of the week, Dogecoin could quickly return 1,000%.\n\nJust make sure you take your profits.\n\nAlong with Cardano/ADA, Polkadot is another promising third-generation cryptocurrency to consider.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 205%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn December, Binance announced a $10 million fund to support projects on Polkadot, a new cryptocurrency. DOT\u2019s price shot up 41% within a week. And more gains could be on the way.\n\nFounded by Gavin Wood, the Chief Technology Officer of the Ethereum Project, its protocol improves on older blockchains. From a technological standpoint, Polkadot\u2019s key difference is its use of parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that can run in parallel. That solves a massive issue for Bitcoin, which has a single, growing blockchain that all miners (and transactors) need to store. Developers have also added scalability, smart contracts and security.\n\nStill, investors need to remember that, in the world of cryptocurrencies, the best technologies aren\u2019t always the winners \u2014 it will take strong marketing (and some luck) to get Polkadot to rival its larger competitors.\n\nNEO \u2014 \u201cthe Chinese Ethereum\u201d \u2014 looks set to shine if the Chinese Communist Party allows it.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $3 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 63%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by NEO\u2019s sleepy looking returns in 2020. NEO (formerly known as Antshares) is one of China\u2019s earliest and largest cryptocurrency ventures. The coin fell hard in 2018 as the Chinese government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. But in 2021, the coin staged a remarkable resurgence as Chinese regulators turned their ire to Ant Group, a payments processor.\n\nWith the Chinese Communist Party now rethinking its stance on cryptocurrencies, NEO has a chance to shine once again.\n\nLender Celsius is a cryptocurrency with the potential to become a bank.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2018Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 3,717%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2018, Celsius Network crowdfunded $20 million to create a cryptocurrency lending platform. Since then, the network has written $6.2 billion in loans and produced $11 million in interest income, making it more like a bank than a currency. And by registering as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Celsius has soared even as other regulatory related currencies like XRP have struggled. In fact, its 2020 return was one of the highest of any other coin.\n\nStill, Celsius has plenty of risk for potential investors. As companies from Bear Stearns to Lehman Brothers found, bad loans can quickly threaten the stability of an entire lending operation. And the Celsius Network has raised red flags in the past, particularly with its unclear collateral requirements. In other words, Celsius could also blow up like a bank if they don\u2019t have the right controls in place.\n\nNevertheless, CEL could still continue to rise. It\u2019s one of the largest pure-play P2P lenders in the crypto space, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in 2021.\n\nWant to have your own blockchain?

Others might point to Nano\u2019s reasonably superior technology. But in the microcap altcoin world, timing has far more to do with luck.\n\nHowever, now that demand is rising, keep watch. A short-term spike is often how new coins gain popularity. With its ability to assign entire blockchains to individual accounts, Nano looks like an attractive Bitcoin alternative.\n\nChainlink is a cryptocurrency that allows others to run smart contracts.

Rather than operate its own blockchain, Chainlink runs smart contracts on other blockchains. That makes LINK an anomaly in the cryptocurrency world \u2014 a coin that\u2019s relatively agnostic to whichever blockchain it\u2019s working on. It\u2019s a formula that sounds good in theory.\n\nFrom an investor standpoint, however, Chainlink\u2019s complexity has worked against it. Making use of the protocol still requires hardcore programming knowledge, and that shrinks its potential audience. What Chainlink needs is a strong sponsor \u2014 a business like Ripple Labs, for example \u2014 to market and implement its smart contracts as required.\n\nIf the currency can find that sponsor, LINK will soar. Otherwise, investors can expect the currency to stall in 2021 as newer smart-contract coins take over.\n\nLisk is an early delegated proof-of-stake coin that was bested by competitors.

The delegated proof-of-stake coin initially priced at $8 as excited ICO investors saw LSK as an alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s issues. Built on JavaScript, one of the most common programming languages, Lisk promised to open application developments to a far wider range of developers.\n\nThe optimism, however, didn\u2019t last. As Lisk\u2019s programming issues began to emerge, the coin\u2019s price began to sink \u2014 certain quirks in its programming language made it relatively inefficient and prone to non-deterministic behavior. By 2017, LSK had shed almost all its value to settle at just 10 cents. And despite a second massive run-up in the 2018 cryptocurrency bubble, the coin has since settled back, dropping off the top-100 coin charts by market cap.\n\nInterest in the coin, however, has refused to completely disappear. Earlier this year, Robinhood added Lisk to its list of tracked cryptocurrencies, sending prices up over 250%. That means, while Lisk might have significant technological issues, renewed interest in the coin could incentivize developers back to the drawing board to improve the coin. If that happens (and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d), Lisk could quickly regain strength and challenge the larger coins once again.\n\nMonero is the No. 1 privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $4 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: 4 cents2020 Return: 244%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMonero has long been a favored coin for its privacy applications.

And its community has continued to improve its privacy \u2014 from improving its decoy transactions to obscuring recipient identities.\n\nBut Monero ran into early issues. Because transactions are so private, it quickly became a favorite of Darknet users looking to hide their tracks. After suffering a series of scandals, XMR\u2019s price plummeted in 2017. Yet, the cryptocurrency has had a revival in recent months.

Like Dai/MakerDAO and other cryptocurrencies that rely on other blockchains, OMG has had trouble raising enough interest to create life of its own. Still, it\u2019s one of the handful of coins Robinhood tracks, making it a potential smaller break-out coin for 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t expect fireworks.

Litecoin\u2019s size also makes it less vulnerable to a \u201c51% attack\u201d than other Bitcoin-like currencies.\n\nMy two-star rating comes down to momentum. Although it was once a popular Bitcoin alternative, Litecoin has since struggled to differentiate itself from its bigger brother.

Such futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell Ether at a predetermined price at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace\u00a0contributor Vivian Medithi covered the topic earlier this month and highlighted, \u201cAnalysts expect to see increased institutional investment in ether as a result of the introduction of futures contracts, bolstering the recent bullish run in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s move comes about three years after its December 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures. At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon. So as a small allocation to a portfolio, it could be worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

A Shiba Inu-themed cryptocurrency that was the brainchild of two software engineers has taken the investing world by storm. After years of being overshadowed by more popular coins like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) and Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD), Dogecoin got its turn in the spotlight after Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) billionaire boss tweeted \u201cWho let the Doge out.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 29 the currency was up 800%, becoming the \u201ccrypto (GameStop (NYSE:GME) gme\u201d according to one Reddit user. A seemingly unknown coin now has the internet abuzz. If there\u2019s one lesson we can learn from this, it\u2019s that memes and tweets have the power to move markets.\n\nAlthough many may have heard about Dogecoin for the first time in the last couple of weeks, the cryptocurrency has actually been around since 2013. The coin was the product of a joke by two software engineers who wanted to pay homage to Bitcoin\u2019s then-questionable reputation. A coin that meant to garner nothing more than a few laughs has now become the face of the cryptocurrency industry. Its claim to fame is the result of a series of tweets and memes.\n\nFor reasons that still remain unclear, Dogecoin caught the attention of billionaire Elon Musk. Tesla\u2019s tenacious CEO took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to tweet about the coin, writing \u201cno highs, no lows, only Doge\u201d along with a Lion King meme with the Shiba Inu dog on Simba\u2019s face.\n\nNot long after this, Dogecoin\u2019s price skyrocketed, surging more than 800% in 24 hours. Other billionaires and pop culture icons like Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg got in on the action, tweeting about the currency as well.\n\nDogecoin is proof of the radical shift in market power with people participating in the rally for a sense of community. Although the coin has no intrinsic value like stocks or bonds, investors are rallying together to get its value to $1. The Dogecoin phenomenon is a case study in how culture and technology have the ability to literally move markets. Just as we saw in GameStop stock\u2019s meteoric rally last month.\n\nDogecoin has dipped 20% since its Feb. 7 high of 0.087159. Nevertheless, the currency is still up 1,350% this year with a market value of $8 billion. While many have expressed enthusiasm about the currency, others remain cautious.\n\nAn article by MarketWatch explains that unlike traditional Bitcoin which is limited in supply, Dogecoin has no built-in limit. This means that it can be mined for hundreds or thousands at any given time. Ultimately, the currency value is the result of a mass-market movement that remains untethered.\n\nSo the currency, as it stands, is largely speculative. Billy Markus, the founder of Dogecoin, recently stated the rally is \u201cnot something (he) can comprehend.\u201d He likened the rally to that of stocks like GameStop and AMC (NYSE:AMC) \u2014 both of which have cooled down considerably from their highs. Many researchers have also urged investors to exercise greater caution when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin.\n\nThe rise in the currency\u2019s price can serve as a real temptation to investors but its long-term growth remains unsustainable. On one hand, the currency is a great investment alternative in an environment where interest rates are close to zero. But on the flip side, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional investments, Bitcoin is disproportionately controlled with 95% of the currency controlled by just 2% of the market.\n\nThe recent rally in Dogecoin is a testament to the power of memes. While the price spikes are definitely attractive, it\u2019s also worth noting that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. According to Garrick Hileman of blockchain.com, Dogecoin could lose 90% of its value.\n\nWith this being a real possibility (as we saw with GME and AMC stock), I wouldn\u2019t go all-in on Dogecoin. However, if you want to be a part of the mass market movement, Dogecoin does trade on the cheap and is worth a small investment. Even if things don\u2019t go your way, it could serve as a great learning opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya Premkumar has a finance degree from the University of Houston, Texas.

The second-ranked crypto just set a new all-time high above $2,000.\n\nEthereum has broken a key psychological resistance barrier at $2,000.\n\nETH has crossed $2,000 for the first time. It\u2019s trading at $2,014 at the time of writing.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nThe digital asset has experienced a violent rise in recent weeks. On Jan. 4, it crossed $1,000 amid a flurry of activity across the crypto markets.\n\nThe run then intensified, with ETH touching $1,430 on Jan. 19, a record high at the time. ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run. ETH often outperforms BTC, however. It\u2019s up roughly 175% year-to-date, while BTC is up 89%.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has also had various wins of its own recently. On Feb. 8, ETH futures launched on CME Group, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange.\n\nThe NFT space, which runs on top of Ethereum, has also enjoyed a boom this year. Several notable celebrities and musicians have piled into the craze, among them Mark Cuban, Logan Paul, and Soulja Boy. This week, iconic auction house Christie\u2019s announced its plans to list an NFT by Beeple. They\u2019ll accept ETH in the auction.\n\nDeFi, meanwhile, continues to grow. There\u2019s over $43 billion locked in DeFi protocols today, according to DeFi Pulse. Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021. Described as an ETH buyback mechanism by EIP-1559 Tim Beiko, the update will see gas fees get burned to reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is now $232.8 billion.\n\nOriginal Post\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum fundamentals signal $2,000 ETH price is closer than it seems", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Cointelegraph", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/K.YZ2ppfF8jyenUdBuQnZA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/f0b2a0af24fd35f1926c73144b285c38", "auther": "", "body": "In the early hours of Feb. 15, Ether (ETH) price plunged to $1,660, followed by a 9% recovery within 10 hours. The move triggered $280 million in futures contracts liquidations, indicating excessive leverage from longs.\n\nAlthough the initial anxiety regarding CME's ETH futures launch on Feb. 8 seems to have faded, sustained excessive transaction fees might have undermined investors' confidence. Nevertheless, the fundamentals behind Ethereum remain solid, indicating ETH price should promptly recover from eventual dips.\n\nEven though the above metric might be interpreted positively, not every user can afford a $12 fee. A simple token swap on decentralized exchanges (DEX) can cost hundreds of dollars in gas fees, leaving small traders no choice but to abandon the network.\n\nMultiple proponents are testing sharding and layer-two solutions to circumvent this issue, including Skale and Optimistic Network. Eth2 will use sharding to split the blockchain into several parts and increase the number of transactions the network can process at once.\n\nThe phenomenal growth of total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance projects can't be disregarded. The adjusted metric attempts to clean readings from ETH price increases, therefore providing more reliable data.\n\nAs depicted above, the 34% increase over the past 30 days falls in line with ETH's 38% gain in February. Regardless of the transaction fees, there is still value created by automated market-making pools and staking mechanisms.\n\nTo better understand whether the recent crash reflects a potential local top and subsequent downtrend movement, one needs further data. Besides price action and technical analysis, investors should also gauge on-chain metrics such as network use. An excellent place to start is analyzing transactions and transfer value.\n\nCoin Metrics data shows the 14-day average transactions and transfers rallying above $9 billion in daily transactions, a 32% increase from the previous month. This significant increase in transaction and transfer value signals strength and suggests that Ether's price is sustainable at the current levels.\n\nAlthough there is no consensus among analysts on the short-term price impact of exchange withdrawals, its effect is either neutral or bullish. The opposite movement, large continuous inflows, is the only bearish scenario, as it indicates holders' willingness to sell.\n\nFrom Jan. 1 to Feb. 15, roughly 600,000 ETH was withdrawn from exchanges. Regardless of if whales are transferring to cold wallets or putting Ether into the DeFi ecosystem, those coins are less likely to be sold in the short term.\n\nConsidering this movement happened while Ethereum made a $1,870 all-time high, the indicator indicates holders' confidence. \n\nTo conclude, based on both on-chain metrics and trading perspective, there are encouraging signals that $2,000 is within reach and that dips are being bought up aggressively.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general.

Based on this trend, the trader said BTC outperforming ETH is not a surprise. He said:\n\nIn the near term, one variable that could catalyze a larger accumulation trend for Ether is the listing of Ethereum futures by CME. As Cointelegraph reported, CME listed Ethereum futures on Feb. 9, the day ETH broke out and achieved a new all-time high.\n\nIt has been less than two weeks since the CME Ethereum futures market launched, and many trading desks and institutions are likely still in the process of preparing their infrastructure. Hence, the actual demand and trading volume for ETH in the CME Ethereum futures market will likely take time to grow, as seen with Bitcoin, until funds begin actively trading the asset.\n\nAt the same time, with the cryptocurrency bull market is in full, major investment funds and retail investors may be experiencing FOMO, according to Paolo Ardoino, the CTO at Bitfinex. He explained:\n\nLastly, one major factor that underpins Bitcoin's \"digital store of value\" proposition is the capped supply of BTC contrary to the unknown total supply of Ether. Therefore, besides the brand image, this digital scarcity aspect is likely what's driving institutions first and foremost to Bitcoin. \n\nMeanwhile, other cryptocurrencies like ETH remain alternatives or \"altcoins\" and are typically considered for the purpose of diversifying, albeit in much smaller amounts if any, as exemplified by Grayscale's holdings.\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Two NYC bars are for sale \u2014 asking price is 25 bitcoin", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/pf.E1D0Bf9xAOkzuMDgcHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/62f05ae0-7302-11eb-bfbf-f3b92472ae90", "auther": "Alexis Christoforous", "body": "A long-time restaurant owner in New York City is looking to sell his two bars for bitcoin.

I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven.

Ask them about cryptocurrency predictions for 2021. As Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), XRP (CCC:XRP-USD) and others have rocketed in value, never before has Wall Street seemed so hesitant about \u201cdigital gold,\u201d a name they use to invoke a margin of safety.\n\nBut as any experienced crypto investor knows, that\u2019s not the way cryptocurrencies work. Instead, it\u2019s a digital popularity contest where winners keep winning and losers bite the dust.\n\nSo, which cryptocurrencies can make you rich in 2021?\n\nTo answer that question, we need to explore the world of altcoins \u2014 up-and-coming coins that you can buy for cheap. That\u2019s because it pays to get in early. For example, $1,000 invested in Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) would be worth $3.3 million today. Meanwhile, $1,000 invested in Bitcoin today might earn \u201cjust\u201d 4-5x upside if you believe JP Morgan\u2019s lofty $146,000 target price.\n\nBut there are also significant risks because cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. Instead, their worth comes from their users. The more users a coin has, the more useful it becomes, and the higher its price goes. But when a coin falls out of favor, there\u2019s nothing to stop it from going to zero. That means investing in cryptocurrency requires strong belief that others will eventually buy it from you for even more.\n\nToday, people invest in crypto for one reason alone: to make money. So far, cryptocurrencies have delivered on that promise. Mom-and-pop investors have profited handsomely as Bitcoin and other currencies have rocketed in value.\n\nBut the risks in 2021 are growing \u2014 at their core, cryptocurrencies only serve to transfer wealth from one party to another. And some new competitors have recently popped up.\n\n\u201cChina has already developed a Central Bank-backed crypto, and in the U.S. it was discussed as part of the C-19 stimulus,\u201d writes Laura Gonzalez, Ph.D., associate professor of Finance at California State University, Long Beach. \u201cThere is ample evidence of speculation as well, and the value of the current cryptos will be affected by the upcoming central-bank backed digital currencies.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unregulated cryptocurrencies will one day compete against state-sponsored ones too.\n\nHere\u2019s the takeaway: if you have an extremely conservative portfolio and need to add \u201crisk-on\u201d assets, choosing a basket of top-rated cryptocurrencies could be right for you. It\u2019s a cheap way to gain massive macroeconomic risk exposure. But don\u2019t get fooled by thinking of crypto as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d If 2021 sees a surprise economic slowdown, no amount of hope will keep crypto afloat.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to take those risks, then you might want to start your search with the top 28 cryptocurrencies you need to know for 2021:\n\nWhile each has enormous potential, some are safer bets than others. As such, I\u2019ve organized the cryptocurrencies based on their overall risk-to-reward potential from most balanced to least. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at the wild world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum is a relative newcomer that has risen up the ranks thanks to its superior technology and its ability to create \u201csmart contracts.\u201d\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $200 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: $102020 Return: 470%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nEther, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is a technologically advanced version of Bitcoin that stands to grow even faster. Rather than hold itself as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d Ethereum runs on a series of contracts. That makes it more like Google Wallet or Apple Pay \u2014 a system that can approve or delay transactions based on real-world events. Online buyers and sellers, for instance, could set up trades that only follow through when the postal service independently verifies the delivery of goods.\n\nEthereum is also blazingly fast compared to Bitcoin: transactions only take 15 seconds to clear, rather than 15 minutes. Although trading costs are still high, its speed makes Ethereum useful for real-time use, rather than only as a store of value. Finally, Ethereum also has widespread adoption, with over 600,000 wallet addresses in use. As developers add services and protocols to make cryptocurrencies more useful, Ethereum looks set to keep winning.\n\nThese qualities have pushed Ethereum to my No. 1 spot in terms of risk-to-reward potential. Despite it having a later start than many other currencies, it has a winning combination of widespread usage, technological superiority and relative safety (compared to smaller coins, at least).\n\nBitcoin is the most widely adopted cryptocurrency. Although it\u2019s not the most technologically advanced, it continues to lead the pack.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $920 billionYear Established: 2009Cost Per Transaction: $152020 Return: 309%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe first successful cryptocurrency continues to lead the pack. With its first-mover advantage, Bitcoin not only won early name recognition. It also became the de-facto cryptocurrency for mainstream investors. Smaller investors can use Square (NYSE:SQ) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) services to buy as little as $1 (or as much as they can \u201chodl\u201d). Meanwhile, institutional investors can use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to transact millions of dollars in futures.\n\nThat makes Bitcoin an essential allocation. The world\u2019s No. 1 coin makes up close to two-thirds of the entire cryptocurrency market, providing liquidity between smaller altcoins. Its size also makes it resistant to 51% attacks, where large cryptocurrency miners attempt to use computing heft to try manipulating the blockchain.\n\nHowever, popular as it may be, Bitcoin has some downsides. As one of the earliest blockchains, Bitcoin\u2019s ledger is large and unwieldy. Transactions can cost $12 to complete and take over 15 minutes to clear. That\u2019s fine for its purpose as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d but it prevents BTC from use as a day-to-day currency. (People paying in Bitcoin will often use third-party services to transact small amounts).\n\nBitcoin is also extremely sensitive to macroeconomic movements \u2014 the currency lost half its value in the most recent U.S. stock market downturn. And if 2021 reveals a weak economic recovery or mutated strain of the novel coronavirus, Bitcoin could easily lose 50-80% of its value. But for those looking to invest in cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the most liquid option. It\u2019s an essential coin to hold, and one that receives top marks for in 2021.\n\nXRP is a centralized cryptocurrency that\u2019s geared toward taking out the high costs of inter-bank transfers.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $24 billionYear Established: 2012Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 16%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIf you could only bet on one cryptocurrency this year, XRP would be it. XRP is the largest currency to have 10x potential for 2021.\n\nXRP is the odd duckling of the cryptocurrency world. Founded by Ripple Labs, XRP is a centralized currency that\u2019s mined, managed and administered by Ripple Labs (instead of a broad-based community). On one hand, that gives the coin the benefits of Visa (NYSE:V) and other centralized payments processors. These include the ability to negotiate with large banks, execute trades quickly and control policies.\n\nOn the other hand, critics are right to question: \u201cWhy use a cryptocurrency in the first place then?\u201d\n\nXRP has also had its share of accounting issues. Specifically, in December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and two executives for selling XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Ripple also controls over half of the XRP supply.\n\nStill, XRP has enormous potential. The currency is used by financial institutions as an alternative to the SWIFT network, giving it a real-world application. And its low price-per-coin makes it a tempting target for punters \u2014 it\u2019s easier to see XRP rising 1,000% to $3.5 than BTC doing the same to $454,000.\n\nA well-placed contender to XRP\u2019s crown, Stellar offers low-cost, cross-border transactions.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $11 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 189%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n2021 is shaping to become Stellar\u2019s year. After lagging Bitcoin in 2020, Stellar surprised analysts and investors alike by rocketing 200% in the first week of January. The coin has continued to outperform expectations since.\n\nMuch of its success comes from XRP\u2019s misfortunes. Much like XRP, Stellar was designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. As regulatory issues mount for rival XRP, Stellar has quickly moved to fill the void. But some of it has also come down to luck. In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowed banks to start using independent node verification networks. The same week, the Ukrainian government announced a partnership with Stellar Development to create a national digital currency.\n\nAll this grants perfect investment conditions for Stellar, a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nCardano is the largest third-generation cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s packed with plenty more upside potential in 2021.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 441%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nADA, which runs on the Cardano network is one of the most technologically exciting cryptocurrencies to date. Its proof-of-stake system means it can operate more efficiently than the standard proof-of-work system. And its use of smart contracts means that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum. In short, it\u2019s a third-generation coin that improves on its predecessors.\n\nADA/Cardano still has plenty of work to do in the year ahead. After all, having a superior technological product means nothing if people won\u2019t adopt it. But three key areas make it a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nFirst, ADA has momentum. The currency took just three years to hit a $10 billion market cap \u2014 one-third the time it took Bitcoin to do the same. Second, it sits at just 30 cents per coin, making it a tempting target for punters to run up. Finally, it has the ability to handle transactions and smart contracts. This makes it a natural enhancement for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nAn internet meme turned cryptocurrency, Dogecoin teaches the world about making money.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $7 billionYear Established: 2013Cost Per Transaction: 3 cents2020 Return: 118%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2013, IBM (NYSE:IBM) software engineer Billy Markus founded Dogecoin as a meme joke. And like most memes, Dogecoin saw its 15 minutes of fame. In 2017, DOGE briefly rocketed 85,000% as the internet found its new amusement; it subsequently lost 98% of its value.\n\nBut in the world of cryptocurrencies and memes alike, second acts DO exist. In December 2020, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sent Dogecoin back up 200% in a week simply by tweeting about it. As 2021 rolls around, this newfound popularity could send the coin up to speculative heights. Dogecoin does have its merits: its faster block time makes it better at processing payments than Bitcoin can. But in an asset class where popularity trounces usability any day of the week, Dogecoin could quickly return 1,000%.\n\nJust make sure you take your profits.\n\nAlong with Cardano/ADA, Polkadot is another promising third-generation cryptocurrency to consider.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 205%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn December, Binance announced a $10 million fund to support projects on Polkadot, a new cryptocurrency. DOT\u2019s price shot up 41% within a week. And more gains could be on the way.\n\nFounded by Gavin Wood, the Chief Technology Officer of the Ethereum Project, its protocol improves on older blockchains. From a technological standpoint, Polkadot\u2019s key difference is its use of parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that can run in parallel. That solves a massive issue for Bitcoin, which has a single, growing blockchain that all miners (and transactors) need to store. Developers have also added scalability, smart contracts and security.\n\nStill, investors need to remember that, in the world of cryptocurrencies, the best technologies aren\u2019t always the winners \u2014 it will take strong marketing (and some luck) to get Polkadot to rival its larger competitors.\n\nNEO \u2014 \u201cthe Chinese Ethereum\u201d \u2014 looks set to shine if the Chinese Communist Party allows it.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $3 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 63%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by NEO\u2019s sleepy looking returns in 2020. NEO (formerly known as Antshares) is one of China\u2019s earliest and largest cryptocurrency ventures. The coin fell hard in 2018 as the Chinese government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. But in 2021, the coin staged a remarkable resurgence as Chinese regulators turned their ire to Ant Group, a payments processor.\n\nWith the Chinese Communist Party now rethinking its stance on cryptocurrencies, NEO has a chance to shine once again.\n\nLender Celsius is a cryptocurrency with the potential to become a bank.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2018Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 3,717%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2018, Celsius Network crowdfunded $20 million to create a cryptocurrency lending platform. Since then, the network has written $6.2 billion in loans and produced $11 million in interest income, making it more like a bank than a currency. And by registering as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Celsius has soared even as other regulatory related currencies like XRP have struggled. In fact, its 2020 return was one of the highest of any other coin.\n\nStill, Celsius has plenty of risk for potential investors. As companies from Bear Stearns to Lehman Brothers found, bad loans can quickly threaten the stability of an entire lending operation. And the Celsius Network has raised red flags in the past, particularly with its unclear collateral requirements. In other words, Celsius could also blow up like a bank if they don\u2019t have the right controls in place.\n\nNevertheless, CEL could still continue to rise. It\u2019s one of the largest pure-play P2P lenders in the crypto space, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in 2021.\n\nWant to have your own blockchain? Nano gives every user their own ledger.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: <$1 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: N/A2020 Return: 54%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nNano is a prime example of playing the cryptocurrency lottery. Having traded sideways in 2020, Nano suddenly jumped 400% in the first week of 2021. Why? Some may point to a December hack on an Italian cryptocurrency exchange. Others might point to Nano\u2019s reasonably superior technology. But in the microcap altcoin world, timing has far more to do with luck.\n\nHowever, now that demand is rising, keep watch. A short-term spike is often how new coins gain popularity. With its ability to assign entire blockchains to individual accounts, Nano looks like an attractive Bitcoin alternative.\n\nChainlink is a cryptocurrency that allows others to run smart contracts. But can LINK succeed on its own?\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $13 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 428%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nChainlink is as different as they come. Rather than operate its own blockchain, Chainlink runs smart contracts on other blockchains. That makes LINK an anomaly in the cryptocurrency world \u2014 a coin that\u2019s relatively agnostic to whichever blockchain it\u2019s working on. It\u2019s a formula that sounds good in theory.\n\nFrom an investor standpoint, however, Chainlink\u2019s complexity has worked against it. Making use of the protocol still requires hardcore programming knowledge, and that shrinks its potential audience. What Chainlink needs is a strong sponsor \u2014 a business like Ripple Labs, for example \u2014 to market and implement its smart contracts as required.\n\nIf the currency can find that sponsor, LINK will soar. Otherwise, investors can expect the currency to stall in 2021 as newer smart-contract coins take over.\n\nLisk is an early delegated proof-of-stake coin that was bested by competitors. Can it regain its strength?\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: <$1 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 104%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nLisk was launched in 2016 to a great deal of optimism. The delegated proof-of-stake coin initially priced at $8 as excited ICO investors saw LSK as an alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s issues. Built on JavaScript, one of the most common programming languages, Lisk promised to open application developments to a far wider range of developers.\n\nThe optimism, however, didn\u2019t last. As Lisk\u2019s programming issues began to emerge, the coin\u2019s price began to sink \u2014 certain quirks in its programming language made it relatively inefficient and prone to non-deterministic behavior. By 2017, LSK had shed almost all its value to settle at just 10 cents. And despite a second massive run-up in the 2018 cryptocurrency bubble, the coin has since settled back, dropping off the top-100 coin charts by market cap.\n\nInterest in the coin, however, has refused to completely disappear. Earlier this year, Robinhood added Lisk to its list of tracked cryptocurrencies, sending prices up over 250%. That means, while Lisk might have significant technological issues, renewed interest in the coin could incentivize developers back to the drawing board to improve the coin. If that happens (and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d), Lisk could quickly regain strength and challenge the larger coins once again.\n\nMonero is the No. 1 privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $4 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: 4 cents2020 Return: 244%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMonero has long been a favored coin for its privacy applications.

And its community has continued to improve its privacy \u2014 from improving its decoy transactions to obscuring recipient identities.\n\nBut Monero ran into early issues. Because transactions are so private, it quickly became a favorite of Darknet users looking to hide their tracks. After suffering a series of scandals, XMR\u2019s price plummeted in 2017. Yet, the cryptocurrency has had a revival in recent months. Since February, the currency has increased by almost 300% as privacy concerns have taken center stage.\n\nAs we move into 2021, XMR looks like a cryptocurrency with second-wind potential. Investors should take note.\n\nOMG is a coin built on the Ethereum network looks set to ride ETH\u2019s coattails\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 280%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nFounded in 2017, OMG Network was built to help Ethereum gain scale. Rather than run every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, the OMG network would use sidechains to group several transactions together before sending them to the main blockchain. These transactions are secured by OMG Network\u2019s coin, OMG.\n\nDespite its relative promise, however, investor interest in the OMG Network has been muted. Like Dai/MakerDAO and other cryptocurrencies that rely on other blockchains, OMG has had trouble raising enough interest to create life of its own. Still, it\u2019s one of the handful of coins Robinhood tracks, making it a potential smaller break-out coin for 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t expect fireworks.

By the second week of February, QTUM had risen 270%.\n\nBut there\u2019s where the similarities begin to end. Unlike Lisk, which is written in the more-commonly used JavaScript, QTUM is written in far faster C. That has allowed its community to develop strong protocols that have kept up with many of Bitcoin\u2019s own modifications.\n\nQTUM remains a niche coin \u2014 as of the beginning of 2021, the cryptocurrency remains outside the top-50 by market cap. But as investors start to look further afield for interesting technologies, QTUM could see its moment to shine.\n\nWith its value linked 1:1 to the U.S. Dollar, Tether is useful for short-term holdings.

That makes Tether useful as 1) a currency, 2) a short-term savings tool and 3) a method of arbitrage between different exchanges.\n\nAs a long-term investment, however, it\u2019s not particularly interesting. Tether\u2019s value won\u2019t ever deviate far from $1. Past accounting scandals have also threatened the coin\u2019s stability. In 2017, the coin dropped to 92 cents, and controversy seems to keep cropping up every couple of months.\n\nNevertheless, Tether is still useful for transferring cryptocurrency between wallets without major price risk. And with many exchanges now offering up to 12% interest on stablecoins, it\u2019s a currency that still shouldn\u2019t get overlooked in 2021.\n\nAs the largest \u201cBitcoin clone,\u201d Litecoin still hasn\u2019t managed a life of its own.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $8 billionYear Established: 2011Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 200%Score: \u2605\u2605\n\nLitecoin is the largest of the \u201cBitcoin clones,\u201d making it far more understandable for most investors.

That has made the younger fork cheaper and faster than Bitcoin to verify. Litecoin\u2019s size also makes it less vulnerable to a \u201c51% attack\u201d than other Bitcoin-like currencies.\n\nMy two-star rating comes down to momentum. Although it was once a popular Bitcoin alternative, Litecoin has since struggled to differentiate itself from its bigger brother.

But today, it\u2019s a shadow of its former self.\n\nIn 2017, as concerns over Bitcoin\u2019s scalability mounted, Amaury Sechet and a group of programmers released Bitcoin Cash to compete. With a 10-minute block time and larger block sizes, BCH can theoretically process more transactions per second than its older rival.\n\nFrom an investment standpoint, however, the fork has been a massive disappointment. Its improvements proved far too minor to excite investors, sending the price of BCH spiraling from a $4,355 peak in 2017 to just $700 or so today. Although BCH will likely ride Bitcoin\u2019s coattails in the near-term, the coin remains a shadow of its former self. My recommendation?

Today, Bitcoin SV trades as a shadow of its former self, having lost almost 90% of its value since the fork.

Put another way, the proverbial $1,000 invested in Ethereum last year would now be worth about $7,000.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Source: Shutterstock\n\n\nIn early February, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) introduced futures contracts in Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, which started in 2015 as a programmable blockchain. Such futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell Ether at a predetermined price at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace\u00a0contributor Vivian Medithi covered the topic earlier this month and highlighted, \u201cAnalysts expect to see increased institutional investment in ether as a result of the introduction of futures contracts, bolstering the recent bullish run in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s move comes about three years after its December 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures. At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon. So as a small allocation to a portfolio, it could be worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

A Shiba Inu-themed cryptocurrency that was the brainchild of two software engineers has taken the investing world by storm. After years of being overshadowed by more popular coins like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) and Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD), Dogecoin got its turn in the spotlight after Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) billionaire boss tweeted \u201cWho let the Doge out.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 29 the currency was up 800%, becoming the \u201ccrypto (GameStop (NYSE:GME) gme\u201d according to one Reddit user. A seemingly unknown coin now has the internet abuzz. If there\u2019s one lesson we can learn from this, it\u2019s that memes and tweets have the power to move markets.\n\nAlthough many may have heard about Dogecoin for the first time in the last couple of weeks, the cryptocurrency has actually been around since 2013. The coin was the product of a joke by two software engineers who wanted to pay homage to Bitcoin\u2019s then-questionable reputation. A coin that meant to garner nothing more than a few laughs has now become the face of the cryptocurrency industry. Its claim to fame is the result of a series of tweets and memes.\n\nFor reasons that still remain unclear, Dogecoin caught the attention of billionaire Elon Musk. Tesla\u2019s tenacious CEO took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to tweet about the coin, writing \u201cno highs, no lows, only Doge\u201d along with a Lion King meme with the Shiba Inu dog on Simba\u2019s face.\n\nNot long after this, Dogecoin\u2019s price skyrocketed, surging more than 800% in 24 hours. Other billionaires and pop culture icons like Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg got in on the action, tweeting about the currency as well.\n\nDogecoin is proof of the radical shift in market power with people participating in the rally for a sense of community. Although the coin has no intrinsic value like stocks or bonds, investors are rallying together to get its value to $1. The Dogecoin phenomenon is a case study in how culture and technology have the ability to literally move markets. Just as we saw in GameStop stock\u2019s meteoric rally last month.\n\nDogecoin has dipped 20% since its Feb. 7 high of 0.087159. Nevertheless, the currency is still up 1,350% this year with a market value of $8 billion. While many have expressed enthusiasm about the currency, others remain cautious.\n\nAn article by MarketWatch explains that unlike traditional Bitcoin which is limited in supply, Dogecoin has no built-in limit. This means that it can be mined for hundreds or thousands at any given time. Ultimately, the currency value is the result of a mass-market movement that remains untethered.\n\nSo the currency, as it stands, is largely speculative. Billy Markus, the founder of Dogecoin, recently stated the rally is \u201cnot something (he) can comprehend.\u201d He likened the rally to that of stocks like GameStop and AMC (NYSE:AMC) \u2014 both of which have cooled down considerably from their highs. Many researchers have also urged investors to exercise greater caution when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin.\n\nThe rise in the currency\u2019s price can serve as a real temptation to investors but its long-term growth remains unsustainable. On one hand, the currency is a great investment alternative in an environment where interest rates are close to zero. But on the flip side, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional investments, Bitcoin is disproportionately controlled with 95% of the currency controlled by just 2% of the market.\n\nThe recent rally in Dogecoin is a testament to the power of memes. While the price spikes are definitely attractive, it\u2019s also worth noting that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. According to Garrick Hileman of blockchain.com, Dogecoin could lose 90% of its value.\n\nWith this being a real possibility (as we saw with GME and AMC stock), I wouldn\u2019t go all-in on Dogecoin. However, if you want to be a part of the mass market movement, Dogecoin does trade on the cheap and is worth a small investment. Even if things don\u2019t go your way, it could serve as a great learning opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya Premkumar has a finance degree from the University of Houston, Texas.

Nevertheless, the fundamentals behind Ethereum remain solid, indicating ETH price should promptly recover from eventual dips.\n\nEven though the above metric might be interpreted positively, not every user can afford a $12 fee. A simple token swap on decentralized exchanges (DEX) can cost hundreds of dollars in gas fees, leaving small traders no choice but to abandon the network.\n\nMultiple proponents are testing sharding and layer-two solutions to circumvent this issue, including Skale and Optimistic Network. Eth2 will use sharding to split the blockchain into several parts and increase the number of transactions the network can process at once.\n\nThe phenomenal growth of total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance projects can't be disregarded. The adjusted metric attempts to clean readings from ETH price increases, therefore providing more reliable data.\n\nAs depicted above, the 34% increase over the past 30 days falls in line with ETH's 38% gain in February.

An excellent place to start is analyzing transactions and transfer value.\n\nCoin Metrics data shows the 14-day average transactions and transfers rallying above $9 billion in daily transactions, a 32% increase from the previous month. This significant increase in transaction and transfer value signals strength and suggests that Ether's price is sustainable at the current levels.\n\nAlthough there is no consensus among analysts on the short-term price impact of exchange withdrawals, its effect is either neutral or bullish. The opposite movement, large continuous inflows, is the only bearish scenario, as it indicates holders' willingness to sell.\n\nFrom Jan. 1 to Feb. 15, roughly 600,000 ETH was withdrawn from exchanges. Regardless of if whales are transferring to cold wallets or putting Ether into the DeFi ecosystem, those coins are less likely to be sold in the short term.\n\nConsidering this movement happened while Ethereum made a $1,870 all-time high, the indicator indicates holders' confidence. \n\nTo conclude, based on both on-chain metrics and trading perspective, there are encouraging signals that $2,000 is within reach and that dips are being bought up aggressively.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general.

Meanwhile, one popular cryptocurrency trader explains that this is \"simple math\" given the growing institutional demand for BTC.\u00a0\n\nWhile ETH is beating BTC in USD terms year-to-date, Bitcoin is gaining steam in February, up 60% compared to Ether's 50%.\u00a0\n\nEther did rally by roughly 6% over the last 24 hours as Grayscale added 20,000 ETH to its Ethereum Trust.\u00a0However, Grayscale's BTC stash is worth $34 billion, which dwarfs its ETH holdings of $5.8 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, a pseudonymous trader known as Bitcoin Jack noted that despite these latest ETH inflows, one single entity, namely MicroStrategy, is adding 20,000 BTC\u00a0worth almost $1 billion to its balance sheet.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Bitcointreasuries, companies are currently holding over 1.2 million BTC worth over $48 billion dollars \u2014 and that figure does not yet\u00a0include Tesla.\u00a0\n\nIn other words, there is a big difference between the amount of Bitcoin that is being acquired by institutions compared to Ether. Based on this trend, the trader said BTC outperforming ETH is not a surprise. He said:\n\nIn the near term, one variable that could catalyze a larger accumulation trend for Ether is the listing of Ethereum futures by CME. As Cointelegraph reported, CME listed Ethereum futures on Feb. 9, the day ETH broke out and achieved a new all-time high.\n\nIt has been less than two weeks since the CME Ethereum futures market launched, and many trading desks and institutions are likely still in the process of preparing their infrastructure. Hence, the actual demand and trading volume for ETH in the CME Ethereum futures market will likely take time to grow, as seen with Bitcoin, until funds begin actively trading the asset.\n\nAt the same time, with the cryptocurrency bull market is in full, major investment funds and retail investors may be experiencing FOMO, according to Paolo Ardoino, the CTO at Bitfinex. He explained:\n\nLastly, one major factor that underpins Bitcoin's \"digital store of value\" proposition is the capped supply of BTC contrary to the unknown total supply of Ether. Therefore, besides the brand image, this digital scarcity aspect is likely what's driving institutions first and foremost to Bitcoin. \n\nMeanwhile, other cryptocurrencies like ETH remain alternatives or \"altcoins\" and are typically considered for the purpose of diversifying, albeit in much smaller amounts if any, as exemplified by Grayscale's holdings.\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Two NYC bars are for sale \u2014 asking price is 25 bitcoin", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/pf.E1D0Bf9xAOkzuMDgcHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/62f05ae0-7302-11eb-bfbf-f3b92472ae90", "auther": "Alexis Christoforous", "body": "A long-time restaurant owner in New York City is looking to sell his two bars for bitcoin. Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Ask them about cryptocurrency predictions for 2021. As Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), XRP (CCC:XRP-USD) and others have rocketed in value, never before has Wall Street seemed so hesitant about \u201cdigital gold,\u201d a name they use to invoke a margin of safety.\n\nBut as any experienced crypto investor knows, that\u2019s not the way cryptocurrencies work. Instead, it\u2019s a digital popularity contest where winners keep winning and losers bite the dust.\n\nSo, which cryptocurrencies can make you rich in 2021?\n\nTo answer that question, we need to explore the world of altcoins \u2014 up-and-coming coins that you can buy for cheap. That\u2019s because it pays to get in early. For example, $1,000 invested in Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) would be worth $3.3 million today. Meanwhile, $1,000 invested in Bitcoin today might earn \u201cjust\u201d 4-5x upside if you believe JP Morgan\u2019s lofty $146,000 target price.\n\nBut there are also significant risks because cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. Instead, their worth comes from their users. The more users a coin has, the more useful it becomes, and the higher its price goes. But when a coin falls out of favor, there\u2019s nothing to stop it from going to zero. That means investing in cryptocurrency requires strong belief that others will eventually buy it from you for even more.\n\nToday, people invest in crypto for one reason alone: to make money. So far, cryptocurrencies have delivered on that promise. Mom-and-pop investors have profited handsomely as Bitcoin and other currencies have rocketed in value.\n\nBut the risks in 2021 are growing \u2014 at their core, cryptocurrencies only serve to transfer wealth from one party to another. And some new competitors have recently popped up.\n\n\u201cChina has already developed a Central Bank-backed crypto, and in the U.S. it was discussed as part of the C-19 stimulus,\u201d writes Laura Gonzalez, Ph.D., associate professor of Finance at California State University, Long Beach. \u201cThere is ample evidence of speculation as well, and the value of the current cryptos will be affected by the upcoming central-bank backed digital currencies.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unregulated cryptocurrencies will one day compete against state-sponsored ones too.\n\nHere\u2019s the takeaway: if you have an extremely conservative portfolio and need to add \u201crisk-on\u201d assets, choosing a basket of top-rated cryptocurrencies could be right for you. It\u2019s a cheap way to gain massive macroeconomic risk exposure. But don\u2019t get fooled by thinking of crypto as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d If 2021 sees a surprise economic slowdown, no amount of hope will keep crypto afloat.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to take those risks, then you might want to start your search with the top 28 cryptocurrencies you need to know for 2021:\n\nWhile each has enormous potential, some are safer bets than others. As such, I\u2019ve organized the cryptocurrencies based on their overall risk-to-reward potential from most balanced to least. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at the wild world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum is a relative newcomer that has risen up the ranks thanks to its superior technology and its ability to create \u201csmart contracts.\u201d\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $200 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: $102020 Return: 470%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nEther, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is a technologically advanced version of Bitcoin that stands to grow even faster. Rather than hold itself as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d Ethereum runs on a series of contracts. That makes it more like Google Wallet or Apple Pay \u2014 a system that can approve or delay transactions based on real-world events. Online buyers and sellers, for instance, could set up trades that only follow through when the postal service independently verifies the delivery of goods.\n\nEthereum is also blazingly fast compared to Bitcoin: transactions only take 15 seconds to clear, rather than 15 minutes. Although trading costs are still high, its speed makes Ethereum useful for real-time use, rather than only as a store of value. Finally, Ethereum also has widespread adoption, with over 600,000 wallet addresses in use. As developers add services and protocols to make cryptocurrencies more useful, Ethereum looks set to keep winning.\n\nThese qualities have pushed Ethereum to my No. 1 spot in terms of risk-to-reward potential. Despite it having a later start than many other currencies, it has a winning combination of widespread usage, technological superiority and relative safety (compared to smaller coins, at least).\n\nBitcoin is the most widely adopted cryptocurrency. Although it\u2019s not the most technologically advanced, it continues to lead the pack.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $920 billionYear Established: 2009Cost Per Transaction: $152020 Return: 309%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe first successful cryptocurrency continues to lead the pack. With its first-mover advantage, Bitcoin not only won early name recognition. It also became the de-facto cryptocurrency for mainstream investors. Smaller investors can use Square (NYSE:SQ) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) services to buy as little as $1 (or as much as they can \u201chodl\u201d). Meanwhile, institutional investors can use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to transact millions of dollars in futures.\n\nThat makes Bitcoin an essential allocation. The world\u2019s No. 1 coin makes up close to two-thirds of the entire cryptocurrency market, providing liquidity between smaller altcoins. Its size also makes it resistant to 51% attacks, where large cryptocurrency miners attempt to use computing heft to try manipulating the blockchain.\n\nHowever, popular as it may be, Bitcoin has some downsides. As one of the earliest blockchains, Bitcoin\u2019s ledger is large and unwieldy. Transactions can cost $12 to complete and take over 15 minutes to clear. That\u2019s fine for its purpose as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d but it prevents BTC from use as a day-to-day currency. (People paying in Bitcoin will often use third-party services to transact small amounts).\n\nBitcoin is also extremely sensitive to macroeconomic movements \u2014 the currency lost half its value in the most recent U.S. stock market downturn. And if 2021 reveals a weak economic recovery or mutated strain of the novel coronavirus, Bitcoin could easily lose 50-80% of its value. But for those looking to invest in cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the most liquid option. It\u2019s an essential coin to hold, and one that receives top marks for in 2021.\n\nXRP is a centralized cryptocurrency that\u2019s geared toward taking out the high costs of inter-bank transfers.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $24 billionYear Established: 2012Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 16%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIf you could only bet on one cryptocurrency this year, XRP would be it. XRP is the largest currency to have 10x potential for 2021.\n\nXRP is the odd duckling of the cryptocurrency world. Founded by Ripple Labs, XRP is a centralized currency that\u2019s mined, managed and administered by Ripple Labs (instead of a broad-based community). On one hand, that gives the coin the benefits of Visa (NYSE:V) and other centralized payments processors. These include the ability to negotiate with large banks, execute trades quickly and control policies.\n\nOn the other hand, critics are right to question: \u201cWhy use a cryptocurrency in the first place then?\u201d\n\nXRP has also had its share of accounting issues. Specifically, in December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and two executives for selling XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Ripple also controls over half of the XRP supply.\n\nStill, XRP has enormous potential. The currency is used by financial institutions as an alternative to the SWIFT network, giving it a real-world application.

After lagging Bitcoin in 2020, Stellar surprised analysts and investors alike by rocketing 200% in the first week of January. The coin has continued to outperform expectations since.\n\nMuch of its success comes from XRP\u2019s misfortunes. Much like XRP, Stellar was designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. As regulatory issues mount for rival XRP, Stellar has quickly moved to fill the void. But some of it has also come down to luck. In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowed banks to start using independent node verification networks. The same week, the Ukrainian government announced a partnership with Stellar Development to create a national digital currency.\n\nAll this grants perfect investment conditions for Stellar, a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nCardano is the largest third-generation cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s packed with plenty more upside potential in 2021.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 441%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nADA, which runs on the Cardano network is one of the most technologically exciting cryptocurrencies to date.

And its use of smart contracts means that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum. In short, it\u2019s a third-generation coin that improves on its predecessors.\n\nADA/Cardano still has plenty of work to do in the year ahead. After all, having a superior technological product means nothing if people won\u2019t adopt it. But three key areas make it a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nFirst, ADA has momentum. The currency took just three years to hit a $10 billion market cap \u2014 one-third the time it took Bitcoin to do the same. Second, it sits at just 30 cents per coin, making it a tempting target for punters to run up. Finally, it has the ability to handle transactions and smart contracts. This makes it a natural enhancement for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nAn internet meme turned cryptocurrency, Dogecoin teaches the world about making money.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $7 billionYear Established: 2013Cost Per Transaction: 3 cents2020 Return: 118%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2013, IBM (NYSE:IBM) software engineer Billy Markus founded Dogecoin as a meme joke.

In 2017, DOGE briefly rocketed 85,000% as the internet found its new amusement; it subsequently lost 98% of its value.\n\nBut in the world of cryptocurrencies and memes alike, second acts DO exist. In December 2020, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sent Dogecoin back up 200% in a week simply by tweeting about it. As 2021 rolls around, this newfound popularity could send the coin up to speculative heights. Dogecoin does have its merits: its faster block time makes it better at processing payments than Bitcoin can.

From a technological standpoint, Polkadot\u2019s key difference is its use of parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that can run in parallel. That solves a massive issue for Bitcoin, which has a single, growing blockchain that all miners (and transactors) need to store. Developers have also added scalability, smart contracts and security.\n\nStill, investors need to remember that, in the world of cryptocurrencies, the best technologies aren\u2019t always the winners \u2014 it will take strong marketing (and some luck) to get Polkadot to rival its larger competitors.\n\nNEO \u2014 \u201cthe Chinese Ethereum\u201d \u2014 looks set to shine if the Chinese Communist Party allows it.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $3 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 63%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by NEO\u2019s sleepy looking returns in 2020.

Since then, the network has written $6.2 billion in loans and produced $11 million in interest income, making it more like a bank than a currency. And by registering as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Celsius has soared even as other regulatory related currencies like XRP have struggled. In fact, its 2020 return was one of the highest of any other coin.\n\nStill, Celsius has plenty of risk for potential investors. As companies from Bear Stearns to Lehman Brothers found, bad loans can quickly threaten the stability of an entire lending operation. And the Celsius Network has raised red flags in the past, particularly with its unclear collateral requirements. In other words, Celsius could also blow up like a bank if they don\u2019t have the right controls in place.\n\nNevertheless, CEL could still continue to rise. It\u2019s one of the largest pure-play P2P lenders in the crypto space, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in 2021.\n\nWant to have your own blockchain?

That makes LINK an anomaly in the cryptocurrency world \u2014 a coin that\u2019s relatively agnostic to whichever blockchain it\u2019s working on. It\u2019s a formula that sounds good in theory.\n\nFrom an investor standpoint, however, Chainlink\u2019s complexity has worked against it. Making use of the protocol still requires hardcore programming knowledge, and that shrinks its potential audience. What Chainlink needs is a strong sponsor \u2014 a business like Ripple Labs, for example \u2014 to market and implement its smart contracts as required.\n\nIf the currency can find that sponsor, LINK will soar. Otherwise, investors can expect the currency to stall in 2021 as newer smart-contract coins take over.\n\nLisk is an early delegated proof-of-stake coin that was bested by competitors.

Built on JavaScript, one of the most common programming languages, Lisk promised to open application developments to a far wider range of developers.\n\nThe optimism, however, didn\u2019t last. As Lisk\u2019s programming issues began to emerge, the coin\u2019s price began to sink \u2014 certain quirks in its programming language made it relatively inefficient and prone to non-deterministic behavior. By 2017, LSK had shed almost all its value to settle at just 10 cents. And despite a second massive run-up in the 2018 cryptocurrency bubble, the coin has since settled back, dropping off the top-100 coin charts by market cap.\n\nInterest in the coin, however, has refused to completely disappear. Earlier this year, Robinhood added Lisk to its list of tracked cryptocurrencies, sending prices up over 250%. That means, while Lisk might have significant technological issues, renewed interest in the coin could incentivize developers back to the drawing board to improve the coin. If that happens (and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d), Lisk could quickly regain strength and challenge the larger coins once again.\n\nMonero is the No. 1 privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $4 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: 4 cents2020 Return: 244%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMonero has long been a favored coin for its privacy applications.

And its community has continued to improve its privacy \u2014 from improving its decoy transactions to obscuring recipient identities.\n\nBut Monero ran into early issues. Because transactions are so private, it quickly became a favorite of Darknet users looking to hide their tracks. After suffering a series of scandals, XMR\u2019s price plummeted in 2017. Yet, the cryptocurrency has had a revival in recent months.

These transactions are secured by OMG Network\u2019s coin, OMG.\n\nDespite its relative promise, however, investor interest in the OMG Network has been muted. Like Dai/MakerDAO and other cryptocurrencies that rely on other blockchains, OMG has had trouble raising enough interest to create life of its own. Still, it\u2019s one of the handful of coins Robinhood tracks, making it a potential smaller break-out coin for 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t expect fireworks.

Litecoin\u2019s size also makes it less vulnerable to a \u201c51% attack\u201d than other Bitcoin-like currencies.\n\nMy two-star rating comes down to momentum. Although it was once a popular Bitcoin alternative, Litecoin has since struggled to differentiate itself from its bigger brother.

Put another way, the proverbial $1,000 invested in Ethereum last year would now be worth about $7,000.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Source: Shutterstock\n\n\nIn early February, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) introduced futures contracts in Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, which started in 2015 as a programmable blockchain. Such futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell Ether at a predetermined price at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace\u00a0contributor Vivian Medithi covered the topic earlier this month and highlighted, \u201cAnalysts expect to see increased institutional investment in ether as a result of the introduction of futures contracts, bolstering the recent bullish run in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s move comes about three years after its December 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures. At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon. So as a small allocation to a portfolio, it could be worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

A Shiba Inu-themed cryptocurrency that was the brainchild of two software engineers has taken the investing world by storm. After years of being overshadowed by more popular coins like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) and Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD), Dogecoin got its turn in the spotlight after Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) billionaire boss tweeted \u201cWho let the Doge out.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 29 the currency was up 800%, becoming the \u201ccrypto (GameStop (NYSE:GME) gme\u201d according to one Reddit user. A seemingly unknown coin now has the internet abuzz. If there\u2019s one lesson we can learn from this, it\u2019s that memes and tweets have the power to move markets.\n\nAlthough many may have heard about Dogecoin for the first time in the last couple of weeks, the cryptocurrency has actually been around since 2013. The coin was the product of a joke by two software engineers who wanted to pay homage to Bitcoin\u2019s then-questionable reputation. A coin that meant to garner nothing more than a few laughs has now become the face of the cryptocurrency industry. Its claim to fame is the result of a series of tweets and memes.\n\nFor reasons that still remain unclear, Dogecoin caught the attention of billionaire Elon Musk. Tesla\u2019s tenacious CEO took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to tweet about the coin, writing \u201cno highs, no lows, only Doge\u201d along with a Lion King meme with the Shiba Inu dog on Simba\u2019s face.\n\nNot long after this, Dogecoin\u2019s price skyrocketed, surging more than 800% in 24 hours. Other billionaires and pop culture icons like Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg got in on the action, tweeting about the currency as well.\n\nDogecoin is proof of the radical shift in market power with people participating in the rally for a sense of community. Although the coin has no intrinsic value like stocks or bonds, investors are rallying together to get its value to $1. The Dogecoin phenomenon is a case study in how culture and technology have the ability to literally move markets. Just as we saw in GameStop stock\u2019s meteoric rally last month.\n\nDogecoin has dipped 20% since its Feb. 7 high of 0.087159. Nevertheless, the currency is still up 1,350% this year with a market value of $8 billion. While many have expressed enthusiasm about the currency, others remain cautious.\n\nAn article by MarketWatch explains that unlike traditional Bitcoin which is limited in supply, Dogecoin has no built-in limit. This means that it can be mined for hundreds or thousands at any given time. Ultimately, the currency value is the result of a mass-market movement that remains untethered.\n\nSo the currency, as it stands, is largely speculative. Billy Markus, the founder of Dogecoin, recently stated the rally is \u201cnot something (he) can comprehend.\u201d He likened the rally to that of stocks like GameStop and AMC (NYSE:AMC) \u2014 both of which have cooled down considerably from their highs. Many researchers have also urged investors to exercise greater caution when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin.\n\nThe rise in the currency\u2019s price can serve as a real temptation to investors but its long-term growth remains unsustainable. On one hand, the currency is a great investment alternative in an environment where interest rates are close to zero. But on the flip side, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional investments, Bitcoin is disproportionately controlled with 95% of the currency controlled by just 2% of the market.\n\nThe recent rally in Dogecoin is a testament to the power of memes. While the price spikes are definitely attractive, it\u2019s also worth noting that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. According to Garrick Hileman of blockchain.com, Dogecoin could lose 90% of its value.\n\nWith this being a real possibility (as we saw with GME and AMC stock), I wouldn\u2019t go all-in on Dogecoin. However, if you want to be a part of the mass market movement, Dogecoin does trade on the cheap and is worth a small investment. Even if things don\u2019t go your way, it could serve as a great learning opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya Premkumar has a finance degree from the University of Houston, Texas.

ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run. ETH often outperforms BTC, however. It\u2019s up roughly 175% year-to-date, while BTC is up 89%.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has also had various wins of its own recently. On Feb. 8, ETH futures launched on CME Group, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange.\n\nThe NFT space, which runs on top of Ethereum, has also enjoyed a boom this year. Several notable celebrities and musicians have piled into the craze, among them Mark Cuban, Logan Paul, and Soulja Boy.

Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021. Described as an ETH buyback mechanism by EIP-1559 Tim Beiko, the update will see gas fees get burned to reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is now $232.8 billion.\n\nOriginal Post\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum fundamentals signal $2,000 ETH price is closer than it seems", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Cointelegraph", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/K.YZ2ppfF8jyenUdBuQnZA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/f0b2a0af24fd35f1926c73144b285c38", "auther": "", "body": "In the early hours of Feb. 15, Ether (ETH) price plunged to $1,660, followed by a 9% recovery within 10 hours. The move triggered $280 million in futures contracts liquidations, indicating excessive leverage from longs.\n\nAlthough the initial anxiety regarding CME's ETH futures launch on Feb. 8 seems to have faded, sustained excessive transaction fees might have undermined investors' confidence. Nevertheless, the fundamentals behind Ethereum remain solid, indicating ETH price should promptly recover from eventual dips.\n\nEven though the above metric might be interpreted positively, not every user can afford a $12 fee. A simple token swap on decentralized exchanges (DEX) can cost hundreds of dollars in gas fees, leaving small traders no choice but to abandon the network.\n\nMultiple proponents are testing sharding and layer-two solutions to circumvent this issue, including Skale and Optimistic Network. Eth2 will use sharding to split the blockchain into several parts and increase the number of transactions the network can process at once.\n\nThe phenomenal growth of total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance projects can't be disregarded. The adjusted metric attempts to clean readings from ETH price increases, therefore providing more reliable data.\n\nAs depicted above, the 34% increase over the past 30 days falls in line with ETH's 38% gain in February. Regardless of the transaction fees, there is still value created by automated market-making pools and staking mechanisms.\n\nTo better understand whether the recent crash reflects a potential local top and subsequent downtrend movement, one needs further data. Besides price action and technical analysis, investors should also gauge on-chain metrics such as network use. An excellent place to start is analyzing transactions and transfer value.\n\nCoin Metrics data shows the 14-day average transactions and transfers rallying above $9 billion in daily transactions, a 32% increase from the previous month. This significant increase in transaction and transfer value signals strength and suggests that Ether's price is sustainable at the current levels.\n\nAlthough there is no consensus among analysts on the short-term price impact of exchange withdrawals, its effect is either neutral or bullish. The opposite movement, large continuous inflows, is the only bearish scenario, as it indicates holders' willingness to sell.\n\nFrom Jan. 1 to Feb. 15, roughly 600,000 ETH was withdrawn from exchanges. Regardless of if whales are transferring to cold wallets or putting Ether into the DeFi ecosystem, those coins are less likely to be sold in the short term.\n\nConsidering this movement happened while Ethereum made a $1,870 all-time high, the indicator indicates holders' confidence. \n\nTo conclude, based on both on-chain metrics and trading perspective, there are encouraging signals that $2,000 is within reach and that dips are being bought up aggressively.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general. But you should at least know this reality before stepping forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Based on this trend, the trader said BTC outperforming ETH is not a surprise. He said:\n\nIn the near term, one variable that could catalyze a larger accumulation trend for Ether is the listing of Ethereum futures by CME. As Cointelegraph reported, CME listed Ethereum futures on Feb. 9, the day ETH broke out and achieved a new all-time high.\n\nIt has been less than two weeks since the CME Ethereum futures market launched, and many trading desks and institutions are likely still in the process of preparing their infrastructure. Hence, the actual demand and trading volume for ETH in the CME Ethereum futures market will likely take time to grow, as seen with Bitcoin, until funds begin actively trading the asset.\n\nAt the same time, with the cryptocurrency bull market is in full, major investment funds and retail investors may be experiencing FOMO, according to Paolo Ardoino, the CTO at Bitfinex. He explained:\n\nLastly, one major factor that underpins Bitcoin's \"digital store of value\" proposition is the capped supply of BTC contrary to the unknown total supply of Ether. Therefore, besides the brand image, this digital scarcity aspect is likely what's driving institutions first and foremost to Bitcoin. \n\nMeanwhile, other cryptocurrencies like ETH remain alternatives or \"altcoins\" and are typically considered for the purpose of diversifying, albeit in much smaller amounts if any, as exemplified by Grayscale's holdings.\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Two NYC bars are for sale \u2014 asking price is 25 bitcoin", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/pf.E1D0Bf9xAOkzuMDgcHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/62f05ae0-7302-11eb-bfbf-f3b92472ae90", "auther": "Alexis Christoforous", "body": "A long-time restaurant owner in New York City is looking to sell his two bars for bitcoin. Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Ask them about cryptocurrency predictions for 2021. As Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), XRP (CCC:XRP-USD) and others have rocketed in value, never before has Wall Street seemed so hesitant about \u201cdigital gold,\u201d a name they use to invoke a margin of safety.\n\nBut as any experienced crypto investor knows, that\u2019s not the way cryptocurrencies work. Instead, it\u2019s a digital popularity contest where winners keep winning and losers bite the dust.\n\nSo, which cryptocurrencies can make you rich in 2021?\n\nTo answer that question, we need to explore the world of altcoins \u2014 up-and-coming coins that you can buy for cheap. That\u2019s because it pays to get in early. For example, $1,000 invested in Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) would be worth $3.3 million today. Meanwhile, $1,000 invested in Bitcoin today might earn \u201cjust\u201d 4-5x upside if you believe JP Morgan\u2019s lofty $146,000 target price.\n\nBut there are also significant risks because cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. Instead, their worth comes from their users. The more users a coin has, the more useful it becomes, and the higher its price goes. But when a coin falls out of favor, there\u2019s nothing to stop it from going to zero. That means investing in cryptocurrency requires strong belief that others will eventually buy it from you for even more.\n\nToday, people invest in crypto for one reason alone: to make money. So far, cryptocurrencies have delivered on that promise. Mom-and-pop investors have profited handsomely as Bitcoin and other currencies have rocketed in value.\n\nBut the risks in 2021 are growing \u2014 at their core, cryptocurrencies only serve to transfer wealth from one party to another. And some new competitors have recently popped up.\n\n\u201cChina has already developed a Central Bank-backed crypto, and in the U.S. it was discussed as part of the C-19 stimulus,\u201d writes Laura Gonzalez, Ph.D., associate professor of Finance at California State University, Long Beach. \u201cThere is ample evidence of speculation as well, and the value of the current cryptos will be affected by the upcoming central-bank backed digital currencies.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unregulated cryptocurrencies will one day compete against state-sponsored ones too.\n\nHere\u2019s the takeaway: if you have an extremely conservative portfolio and need to add \u201crisk-on\u201d assets, choosing a basket of top-rated cryptocurrencies could be right for you. It\u2019s a cheap way to gain massive macroeconomic risk exposure. But don\u2019t get fooled by thinking of crypto as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d If 2021 sees a surprise economic slowdown, no amount of hope will keep crypto afloat.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to take those risks, then you might want to start your search with the top 28 cryptocurrencies you need to know for 2021:\n\nWhile each has enormous potential, some are safer bets than others. As such, I\u2019ve organized the cryptocurrencies based on their overall risk-to-reward potential from most balanced to least. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at the wild world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum is a relative newcomer that has risen up the ranks thanks to its superior technology and its ability to create \u201csmart contracts.\u201d\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $200 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: $102020 Return: 470%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nEther, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is a technologically advanced version of Bitcoin that stands to grow even faster. Rather than hold itself as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d Ethereum runs on a series of contracts. That makes it more like Google Wallet or Apple Pay \u2014 a system that can approve or delay transactions based on real-world events. Online buyers and sellers, for instance, could set up trades that only follow through when the postal service independently verifies the delivery of goods.\n\nEthereum is also blazingly fast compared to Bitcoin: transactions only take 15 seconds to clear, rather than 15 minutes. Although trading costs are still high, its speed makes Ethereum useful for real-time use, rather than only as a store of value. Finally, Ethereum also has widespread adoption, with over 600,000 wallet addresses in use. As developers add services and protocols to make cryptocurrencies more useful, Ethereum looks set to keep winning.\n\nThese qualities have pushed Ethereum to my No. 1 spot in terms of risk-to-reward potential. Despite it having a later start than many other currencies, it has a winning combination of widespread usage, technological superiority and relative safety (compared to smaller coins, at least).\n\nBitcoin is the most widely adopted cryptocurrency. Although it\u2019s not the most technologically advanced, it continues to lead the pack.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $920 billionYear Established: 2009Cost Per Transaction: $152020 Return: 309%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe first successful cryptocurrency continues to lead the pack. With its first-mover advantage, Bitcoin not only won early name recognition. It also became the de-facto cryptocurrency for mainstream investors. Smaller investors can use Square (NYSE:SQ) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) services to buy as little as $1 (or as much as they can \u201chodl\u201d). Meanwhile, institutional investors can use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to transact millions of dollars in futures.\n\nThat makes Bitcoin an essential allocation. The world\u2019s No. 1 coin makes up close to two-thirds of the entire cryptocurrency market, providing liquidity between smaller altcoins. Its size also makes it resistant to 51% attacks, where large cryptocurrency miners attempt to use computing heft to try manipulating the blockchain.\n\nHowever, popular as it may be, Bitcoin has some downsides. As one of the earliest blockchains, Bitcoin\u2019s ledger is large and unwieldy. Transactions can cost $12 to complete and take over 15 minutes to clear. That\u2019s fine for its purpose as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d but it prevents BTC from use as a day-to-day currency. (People paying in Bitcoin will often use third-party services to transact small amounts).\n\nBitcoin is also extremely sensitive to macroeconomic movements \u2014 the currency lost half its value in the most recent U.S. stock market downturn. And if 2021 reveals a weak economic recovery or mutated strain of the novel coronavirus, Bitcoin could easily lose 50-80% of its value. But for those looking to invest in cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the most liquid option. It\u2019s an essential coin to hold, and one that receives top marks for in 2021.\n\nXRP is a centralized cryptocurrency that\u2019s geared toward taking out the high costs of inter-bank transfers.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $24 billionYear Established: 2012Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 16%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIf you could only bet on one cryptocurrency this year, XRP would be it. XRP is the largest currency to have 10x potential for 2021.\n\nXRP is the odd duckling of the cryptocurrency world. Founded by Ripple Labs, XRP is a centralized currency that\u2019s mined, managed and administered by Ripple Labs (instead of a broad-based community). On one hand, that gives the coin the benefits of Visa (NYSE:V) and other centralized payments processors. These include the ability to negotiate with large banks, execute trades quickly and control policies.\n\nOn the other hand, critics are right to question: \u201cWhy use a cryptocurrency in the first place then?\u201d\n\nXRP has also had its share of accounting issues. Specifically, in December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and two executives for selling XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Ripple also controls over half of the XRP supply.\n\nStill, XRP has enormous potential. The currency is used by financial institutions as an alternative to the SWIFT network, giving it a real-world application. And its low price-per-coin makes it a tempting target for punters \u2014 it\u2019s easier to see XRP rising 1,000% to $3.5 than BTC doing the same to $454,000.\n\nA well-placed contender to XRP\u2019s crown, Stellar offers low-cost, cross-border transactions.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $11 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 189%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n2021 is shaping to become Stellar\u2019s year. After lagging Bitcoin in 2020, Stellar surprised analysts and investors alike by rocketing 200% in the first week of January. The coin has continued to outperform expectations since.\n\nMuch of its success comes from XRP\u2019s misfortunes. Much like XRP, Stellar was designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. As regulatory issues mount for rival XRP, Stellar has quickly moved to fill the void. But some of it has also come down to luck. In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowed banks to start using independent node verification networks. The same week, the Ukrainian government announced a partnership with Stellar Development to create a national digital currency.\n\nAll this grants perfect investment conditions for Stellar, a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nCardano is the largest third-generation cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s packed with plenty more upside potential in 2021.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 441%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nADA, which runs on the Cardano network is one of the most technologically exciting cryptocurrencies to date. Its proof-of-stake system means it can operate more efficiently than the standard proof-of-work system. And its use of smart contracts means that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum. In short, it\u2019s a third-generation coin that improves on its predecessors.\n\nADA/Cardano still has plenty of work to do in the year ahead. After all, having a superior technological product means nothing if people won\u2019t adopt it. But three key areas make it a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nFirst, ADA has momentum. The currency took just three years to hit a $10 billion market cap \u2014 one-third the time it took Bitcoin to do the same. Second, it sits at just 30 cents per coin, making it a tempting target for punters to run up. Finally, it has the ability to handle transactions and smart contracts. This makes it a natural enhancement for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nAn internet meme turned cryptocurrency, Dogecoin teaches the world about making money.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $7 billionYear Established: 2013Cost Per Transaction: 3 cents2020 Return: 118%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2013, IBM (NYSE:IBM) software engineer Billy Markus founded Dogecoin as a meme joke. And like most memes, Dogecoin saw its 15 minutes of fame. In 2017, DOGE briefly rocketed 85,000% as the internet found its new amusement; it subsequently lost 98% of its value.\n\nBut in the world of cryptocurrencies and memes alike, second acts DO exist. In December 2020, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sent Dogecoin back up 200% in a week simply by tweeting about it. As 2021 rolls around, this newfound popularity could send the coin up to speculative heights. Dogecoin does have its merits: its faster block time makes it better at processing payments than Bitcoin can. But in an asset class where popularity trounces usability any day of the week, Dogecoin could quickly return 1,000%.\n\nJust make sure you take your profits.\n\nAlong with Cardano/ADA, Polkadot is another promising third-generation cryptocurrency to consider.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 205%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn December, Binance announced a $10 million fund to support projects on Polkadot, a new cryptocurrency. DOT\u2019s price shot up 41% within a week. And more gains could be on the way.\n\nFounded by Gavin Wood, the Chief Technology Officer of the Ethereum Project, its protocol improves on older blockchains. From a technological standpoint, Polkadot\u2019s key difference is its use of parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that can run in parallel. That solves a massive issue for Bitcoin, which has a single, growing blockchain that all miners (and transactors) need to store. Developers have also added scalability, smart contracts and security.\n\nStill, investors need to remember that, in the world of cryptocurrencies, the best technologies aren\u2019t always the winners \u2014 it will take strong marketing (and some luck) to get Polkadot to rival its larger competitors.\n\nNEO \u2014 \u201cthe Chinese Ethereum\u201d \u2014 looks set to shine if the Chinese Communist Party allows it.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $3 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 63%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by NEO\u2019s sleepy looking returns in 2020. NEO (formerly known as Antshares) is one of China\u2019s earliest and largest cryptocurrency ventures. The coin fell hard in 2018 as the Chinese government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. But in 2021, the coin staged a remarkable resurgence as Chinese regulators turned their ire to Ant Group, a payments processor.\n\nWith the Chinese Communist Party now rethinking its stance on cryptocurrencies, NEO has a chance to shine once again.\n\nLender Celsius is a cryptocurrency with the potential to become a bank.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2018Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 3,717%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2018, Celsius Network crowdfunded $20 million to create a cryptocurrency lending platform. Since then, the network has written $6.2 billion in loans and produced $11 million in interest income, making it more like a bank than a currency. And by registering as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Celsius has soared even as other regulatory related currencies like XRP have struggled. In fact, its 2020 return was one of the highest of any other coin.\n\nStill, Celsius has plenty of risk for potential investors. As companies from Bear Stearns to Lehman Brothers found, bad loans can quickly threaten the stability of an entire lending operation. And the Celsius Network has raised red flags in the past, particularly with its unclear collateral requirements. In other words, Celsius could also blow up like a bank if they don\u2019t have the right controls in place.\n\nNevertheless, CEL could still continue to rise. It\u2019s one of the largest pure-play P2P lenders in the crypto space, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in 2021.\n\nWant to have your own blockchain?

Having traded sideways in 2020, Nano suddenly jumped 400% in the first week of 2021. Why? Some may point to a December hack on an Italian cryptocurrency exchange. Others might point to Nano\u2019s reasonably superior technology. But in the microcap altcoin world, timing has far more to do with luck.\n\nHowever, now that demand is rising, keep watch. A short-term spike is often how new coins gain popularity. With its ability to assign entire blockchains to individual accounts, Nano looks like an attractive Bitcoin alternative.\n\nChainlink is a cryptocurrency that allows others to run smart contracts. But can LINK succeed on its own?\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $13 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 428%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nChainlink is as different as they come. Rather than operate its own blockchain, Chainlink runs smart contracts on other blockchains. That makes LINK an anomaly in the cryptocurrency world \u2014 a coin that\u2019s relatively agnostic to whichever blockchain it\u2019s working on. It\u2019s a formula that sounds good in theory.\n\nFrom an investor standpoint, however, Chainlink\u2019s complexity has worked against it. Making use of the protocol still requires hardcore programming knowledge, and that shrinks its potential audience. What Chainlink needs is a strong sponsor \u2014 a business like Ripple Labs, for example \u2014 to market and implement its smart contracts as required.\n\nIf the currency can find that sponsor, LINK will soar. Otherwise, investors can expect the currency to stall in 2021 as newer smart-contract coins take over.\n\nLisk is an early delegated proof-of-stake coin that was bested by competitors. Can it regain its strength?\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: <$1 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 104%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nLisk was launched in 2016 to a great deal of optimism. The delegated proof-of-stake coin initially priced at $8 as excited ICO investors saw LSK as an alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s issues. Built on JavaScript, one of the most common programming languages, Lisk promised to open application developments to a far wider range of developers.\n\nThe optimism, however, didn\u2019t last. As Lisk\u2019s programming issues began to emerge, the coin\u2019s price began to sink \u2014 certain quirks in its programming language made it relatively inefficient and prone to non-deterministic behavior. By 2017, LSK had shed almost all its value to settle at just 10 cents. And despite a second massive run-up in the 2018 cryptocurrency bubble, the coin has since settled back, dropping off the top-100 coin charts by market cap.\n\nInterest in the coin, however, has refused to completely disappear. Earlier this year, Robinhood added Lisk to its list of tracked cryptocurrencies, sending prices up over 250%. That means, while Lisk might have significant technological issues, renewed interest in the coin could incentivize developers back to the drawing board to improve the coin. If that happens (and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d), Lisk could quickly regain strength and challenge the larger coins once again.\n\nMonero is the No. 1 privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $4 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: 4 cents2020 Return: 244%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMonero has long been a favored coin for its privacy applications.

And its community has continued to improve its privacy \u2014 from improving its decoy transactions to obscuring recipient identities.\n\nBut Monero ran into early issues. Because transactions are so private, it quickly became a favorite of Darknet users looking to hide their tracks. After suffering a series of scandals, XMR\u2019s price plummeted in 2017. Yet, the cryptocurrency has had a revival in recent months. Since February, the currency has increased by almost 300% as privacy concerns have taken center stage.\n\nAs we move into 2021, XMR looks like a cryptocurrency with second-wind potential. Investors should take note.\n\nOMG is a coin built on the Ethereum network looks set to ride ETH\u2019s coattails\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 280%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nFounded in 2017, OMG Network was built to help Ethereum gain scale. Rather than run every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, the OMG network would use sidechains to group several transactions together before sending them to the main blockchain. These transactions are secured by OMG Network\u2019s coin, OMG.\n\nDespite its relative promise, however, investor interest in the OMG Network has been muted. Like Dai/MakerDAO and other cryptocurrencies that rely on other blockchains, OMG has had trouble raising enough interest to create life of its own. Still, it\u2019s one of the handful of coins Robinhood tracks, making it a potential smaller break-out coin for 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t expect fireworks.

By the second week of February, QTUM had risen 270%.\n\nBut there\u2019s where the similarities begin to end. Unlike Lisk, which is written in the more-commonly used JavaScript, QTUM is written in far faster C. That has allowed its community to develop strong protocols that have kept up with many of Bitcoin\u2019s own modifications.\n\nQTUM remains a niche coin \u2014 as of the beginning of 2021, the cryptocurrency remains outside the top-50 by market cap. But as investors start to look further afield for interesting technologies, QTUM could see its moment to shine.\n\nWith its value linked 1:1 to the U.S. Dollar, Tether is useful for short-term holdings.

That makes Tether useful as 1) a currency, 2) a short-term savings tool and 3) a method of arbitrage between different exchanges.\n\nAs a long-term investment, however, it\u2019s not particularly interesting. Tether\u2019s value won\u2019t ever deviate far from $1. Past accounting scandals have also threatened the coin\u2019s stability. In 2017, the coin dropped to 92 cents, and controversy seems to keep cropping up every couple of months.\n\nNevertheless, Tether is still useful for transferring cryptocurrency between wallets without major price risk. And with many exchanges now offering up to 12% interest on stablecoins, it\u2019s a currency that still shouldn\u2019t get overlooked in 2021.\n\nAs the largest \u201cBitcoin clone,\u201d Litecoin still hasn\u2019t managed a life of its own.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $8 billionYear Established: 2011Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 200%Score: \u2605\u2605\n\nLitecoin is the largest of the \u201cBitcoin clones,\u201d making it far more understandable for most investors.

That has made the younger fork cheaper and faster than Bitcoin to verify. Litecoin\u2019s size also makes it less vulnerable to a \u201c51% attack\u201d than other Bitcoin-like currencies.\n\nMy two-star rating comes down to momentum. Although it was once a popular Bitcoin alternative, Litecoin has since struggled to differentiate itself from its bigger brother. While it could be a good holding for 2021, it\u2019s going to ride Bitcoin\u2019s success rather than shine on its own.\n\nBinance\u2019s homegrown coin has use on its platform, but not much else.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $5 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: N/A2020 Return: 160%Score: \u2605\u2605\n\nBinance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, launched its own currency to reduce transaction costs.

A Shiba Inu-themed cryptocurrency that was the brainchild of two software engineers has taken the investing world by storm. After years of being overshadowed by more popular coins like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) and Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD), Dogecoin got its turn in the spotlight after Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) billionaire boss tweeted \u201cWho let the Doge out.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 29 the currency was up 800%, becoming the \u201ccrypto (GameStop (NYSE:GME) gme\u201d according to one Reddit user. A seemingly unknown coin now has the internet abuzz. If there\u2019s one lesson we can learn from this, it\u2019s that memes and tweets have the power to move markets.\n\nAlthough many may have heard about Dogecoin for the first time in the last couple of weeks, the cryptocurrency has actually been around since 2013. The coin was the product of a joke by two software engineers who wanted to pay homage to Bitcoin\u2019s then-questionable reputation. A coin that meant to garner nothing more than a few laughs has now become the face of the cryptocurrency industry. Its claim to fame is the result of a series of tweets and memes.\n\nFor reasons that still remain unclear, Dogecoin caught the attention of billionaire Elon Musk. Tesla\u2019s tenacious CEO took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to tweet about the coin, writing \u201cno highs, no lows, only Doge\u201d along with a Lion King meme with the Shiba Inu dog on Simba\u2019s face.\n\nNot long after this, Dogecoin\u2019s price skyrocketed, surging more than 800% in 24 hours. Other billionaires and pop culture icons like Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg got in on the action, tweeting about the currency as well.\n\nDogecoin is proof of the radical shift in market power with people participating in the rally for a sense of community. Although the coin has no intrinsic value like stocks or bonds, investors are rallying together to get its value to $1. The Dogecoin phenomenon is a case study in how culture and technology have the ability to literally move markets. Just as we saw in GameStop stock\u2019s meteoric rally last month.\n\nDogecoin has dipped 20% since its Feb. 7 high of 0.087159. Nevertheless, the currency is still up 1,350% this year with a market value of $8 billion. While many have expressed enthusiasm about the currency, others remain cautious.\n\nAn article by MarketWatch explains that unlike traditional Bitcoin which is limited in supply, Dogecoin has no built-in limit. This means that it can be mined for hundreds or thousands at any given time. Ultimately, the currency value is the result of a mass-market movement that remains untethered.\n\nSo the currency, as it stands, is largely speculative. Billy Markus, the founder of Dogecoin, recently stated the rally is \u201cnot something (he) can comprehend.\u201d He likened the rally to that of stocks like GameStop and AMC (NYSE:AMC) \u2014 both of which have cooled down considerably from their highs. Many researchers have also urged investors to exercise greater caution when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin.\n\nThe rise in the currency\u2019s price can serve as a real temptation to investors but its long-term growth remains unsustainable. On one hand, the currency is a great investment alternative in an environment where interest rates are close to zero. But on the flip side, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional investments, Bitcoin is disproportionately controlled with 95% of the currency controlled by just 2% of the market.\n\nThe recent rally in Dogecoin is a testament to the power of memes. While the price spikes are definitely attractive, it\u2019s also worth noting that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. According to Garrick Hileman of blockchain.com, Dogecoin could lose 90% of its value.\n\nWith this being a real possibility (as we saw with GME and AMC stock), I wouldn\u2019t go all-in on Dogecoin. However, if you want to be a part of the mass market movement, Dogecoin does trade on the cheap and is worth a small investment. Even if things don\u2019t go your way, it could serve as a great learning opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya Premkumar has a finance degree from the University of Houston, Texas.

ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run. ETH often outperforms BTC, however. It\u2019s up roughly 175% year-to-date, while BTC is up 89%.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has also had various wins of its own recently. On Feb. 8, ETH futures launched on CME Group, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange.\n\nThe NFT space, which runs on top of Ethereum, has also enjoyed a boom this year. Several notable celebrities and musicians have piled into the craze, among them Mark Cuban, Logan Paul, and Soulja Boy. This week, iconic auction house Christie\u2019s announced its plans to list an NFT by Beeple. They\u2019ll accept ETH in the auction.\n\nDeFi, meanwhile, continues to grow. There\u2019s over $43 billion locked in DeFi protocols today, according to DeFi Pulse. Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021. Described as an ETH buyback mechanism by EIP-1559 Tim Beiko, the update will see gas fees get burned to reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is now $232.8 billion.\n\nOriginal Post\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum fundamentals signal $2,000 ETH price is closer than it seems", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Cointelegraph", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/K.YZ2ppfF8jyenUdBuQnZA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/f0b2a0af24fd35f1926c73144b285c38", "auther": "", "body": "In the early hours of Feb. 15, Ether (ETH) price plunged to $1,660, followed by a 9% recovery within 10 hours. The move triggered $280 million in futures contracts liquidations, indicating excessive leverage from longs.\n\nAlthough the initial anxiety regarding CME's ETH futures launch on Feb. 8 seems to have faded, sustained excessive transaction fees might have undermined investors' confidence. Nevertheless, the fundamentals behind Ethereum remain solid, indicating ETH price should promptly recover from eventual dips.\n\nEven though the above metric might be interpreted positively, not every user can afford a $12 fee. A simple token swap on decentralized exchanges (DEX) can cost hundreds of dollars in gas fees, leaving small traders no choice but to abandon the network.\n\nMultiple proponents are testing sharding and layer-two solutions to circumvent this issue, including Skale and Optimistic Network. Eth2 will use sharding to split the blockchain into several parts and increase the number of transactions the network can process at once.\n\nThe phenomenal growth of total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance projects can't be disregarded. The adjusted metric attempts to clean readings from ETH price increases, therefore providing more reliable data.\n\nAs depicted above, the 34% increase over the past 30 days falls in line with ETH's 38% gain in February. Regardless of the transaction fees, there is still value created by automated market-making pools and staking mechanisms.\n\nTo better understand whether the recent crash reflects a potential local top and subsequent downtrend movement, one needs further data. Besides price action and technical analysis, investors should also gauge on-chain metrics such as network use. An excellent place to start is analyzing transactions and transfer value.\n\nCoin Metrics data shows the 14-day average transactions and transfers rallying above $9 billion in daily transactions, a 32% increase from the previous month. This significant increase in transaction and transfer value signals strength and suggests that Ether's price is sustainable at the current levels.\n\nAlthough there is no consensus among analysts on the short-term price impact of exchange withdrawals, its effect is either neutral or bullish. The opposite movement, large continuous inflows, is the only bearish scenario, as it indicates holders' willingness to sell.\n\nFrom Jan. 1 to Feb. 15, roughly 600,000 ETH was withdrawn from exchanges. Regardless of if whales are transferring to cold wallets or putting Ether into the DeFi ecosystem, those coins are less likely to be sold in the short term.\n\nConsidering this movement happened while Ethereum made a $1,870 all-time high, the indicator indicates holders' confidence. \n\nTo conclude, based on both on-chain metrics and trading perspective, there are encouraging signals that $2,000 is within reach and that dips are being bought up aggressively.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general.

Based on this trend, the trader said BTC outperforming ETH is not a surprise. He said:\n\nIn the near term, one variable that could catalyze a larger accumulation trend for Ether is the listing of Ethereum futures by CME. As Cointelegraph reported, CME listed Ethereum futures on Feb. 9, the day ETH broke out and achieved a new all-time high.\n\nIt has been less than two weeks since the CME Ethereum futures market launched, and many trading desks and institutions are likely still in the process of preparing their infrastructure. Hence, the actual demand and trading volume for ETH in the CME Ethereum futures market will likely take time to grow, as seen with Bitcoin, until funds begin actively trading the asset.\n\nAt the same time, with the cryptocurrency bull market is in full, major investment funds and retail investors may be experiencing FOMO, according to Paolo Ardoino, the CTO at Bitfinex. He explained:\n\nLastly, one major factor that underpins Bitcoin's \"digital store of value\" proposition is the capped supply of BTC contrary to the unknown total supply of Ether. Therefore, besides the brand image, this digital scarcity aspect is likely what's driving institutions first and foremost to Bitcoin. \n\nMeanwhile, other cryptocurrencies like ETH remain alternatives or \"altcoins\" and are typically considered for the purpose of diversifying, albeit in much smaller amounts if any, as exemplified by Grayscale's holdings.\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Two NYC bars are for sale \u2014 asking price is 25 bitcoin", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/pf.E1D0Bf9xAOkzuMDgcHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/62f05ae0-7302-11eb-bfbf-f3b92472ae90", "auther": "Alexis Christoforous", "body": "A long-time restaurant owner in New York City is looking to sell his two bars for bitcoin.

Ask them about cryptocurrency predictions for 2021. As Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), XRP (CCC:XRP-USD) and others have rocketed in value, never before has Wall Street seemed so hesitant about \u201cdigital gold,\u201d a name they use to invoke a margin of safety.\n\nBut as any experienced crypto investor knows, that\u2019s not the way cryptocurrencies work. Instead, it\u2019s a digital popularity contest where winners keep winning and losers bite the dust.\n\nSo, which cryptocurrencies can make you rich in 2021?\n\nTo answer that question, we need to explore the world of altcoins \u2014 up-and-coming coins that you can buy for cheap. That\u2019s because it pays to get in early. For example, $1,000 invested in Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) would be worth $3.3 million today. Meanwhile, $1,000 invested in Bitcoin today might earn \u201cjust\u201d 4-5x upside if you believe JP Morgan\u2019s lofty $146,000 target price.\n\nBut there are also significant risks because cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. Instead, their worth comes from their users. The more users a coin has, the more useful it becomes, and the higher its price goes. But when a coin falls out of favor, there\u2019s nothing to stop it from going to zero. That means investing in cryptocurrency requires strong belief that others will eventually buy it from you for even more.\n\nToday, people invest in crypto for one reason alone: to make money. So far, cryptocurrencies have delivered on that promise. Mom-and-pop investors have profited handsomely as Bitcoin and other currencies have rocketed in value.\n\nBut the risks in 2021 are growing \u2014 at their core, cryptocurrencies only serve to transfer wealth from one party to another. And some new competitors have recently popped up.\n\n\u201cChina has already developed a Central Bank-backed crypto, and in the U.S. it was discussed as part of the C-19 stimulus,\u201d writes Laura Gonzalez, Ph.D., associate professor of Finance at California State University, Long Beach. \u201cThere is ample evidence of speculation as well, and the value of the current cryptos will be affected by the upcoming central-bank backed digital currencies.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unregulated cryptocurrencies will one day compete against state-sponsored ones too.\n\nHere\u2019s the takeaway: if you have an extremely conservative portfolio and need to add \u201crisk-on\u201d assets, choosing a basket of top-rated cryptocurrencies could be right for you. It\u2019s a cheap way to gain massive macroeconomic risk exposure. But don\u2019t get fooled by thinking of crypto as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d If 2021 sees a surprise economic slowdown, no amount of hope will keep crypto afloat.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to take those risks, then you might want to start your search with the top 28 cryptocurrencies you need to know for 2021:\n\nWhile each has enormous potential, some are safer bets than others. As such, I\u2019ve organized the cryptocurrencies based on their overall risk-to-reward potential from most balanced to least. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at the wild world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum is a relative newcomer that has risen up the ranks thanks to its superior technology and its ability to create \u201csmart contracts.\u201d\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $200 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: $102020 Return: 470%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nEther, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is a technologically advanced version of Bitcoin that stands to grow even faster. Rather than hold itself as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d Ethereum runs on a series of contracts. That makes it more like Google Wallet or Apple Pay \u2014 a system that can approve or delay transactions based on real-world events. Online buyers and sellers, for instance, could set up trades that only follow through when the postal service independently verifies the delivery of goods.\n\nEthereum is also blazingly fast compared to Bitcoin: transactions only take 15 seconds to clear, rather than 15 minutes. Although trading costs are still high, its speed makes Ethereum useful for real-time use, rather than only as a store of value. Finally, Ethereum also has widespread adoption, with over 600,000 wallet addresses in use. As developers add services and protocols to make cryptocurrencies more useful, Ethereum looks set to keep winning.\n\nThese qualities have pushed Ethereum to my No. 1 spot in terms of risk-to-reward potential. Despite it having a later start than many other currencies, it has a winning combination of widespread usage, technological superiority and relative safety (compared to smaller coins, at least).\n\nBitcoin is the most widely adopted cryptocurrency. Although it\u2019s not the most technologically advanced, it continues to lead the pack.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $920 billionYear Established: 2009Cost Per Transaction: $152020 Return: 309%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe first successful cryptocurrency continues to lead the pack. With its first-mover advantage, Bitcoin not only won early name recognition. It also became the de-facto cryptocurrency for mainstream investors. Smaller investors can use Square (NYSE:SQ) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) services to buy as little as $1 (or as much as they can \u201chodl\u201d). Meanwhile, institutional investors can use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to transact millions of dollars in futures.\n\nThat makes Bitcoin an essential allocation. The world\u2019s No. 1 coin makes up close to two-thirds of the entire cryptocurrency market, providing liquidity between smaller altcoins. Its size also makes it resistant to 51% attacks, where large cryptocurrency miners attempt to use computing heft to try manipulating the blockchain.\n\nHowever, popular as it may be, Bitcoin has some downsides. As one of the earliest blockchains, Bitcoin\u2019s ledger is large and unwieldy. Transactions can cost $12 to complete and take over 15 minutes to clear. That\u2019s fine for its purpose as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d but it prevents BTC from use as a day-to-day currency. (People paying in Bitcoin will often use third-party services to transact small amounts).\n\nBitcoin is also extremely sensitive to macroeconomic movements \u2014 the currency lost half its value in the most recent U.S. stock market downturn. And if 2021 reveals a weak economic recovery or mutated strain of the novel coronavirus, Bitcoin could easily lose 50-80% of its value. But for those looking to invest in cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the most liquid option. It\u2019s an essential coin to hold, and one that receives top marks for in 2021.\n\nXRP is a centralized cryptocurrency that\u2019s geared toward taking out the high costs of inter-bank transfers.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $24 billionYear Established: 2012Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 16%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIf you could only bet on one cryptocurrency this year, XRP would be it. XRP is the largest currency to have 10x potential for 2021.\n\nXRP is the odd duckling of the cryptocurrency world. Founded by Ripple Labs, XRP is a centralized currency that\u2019s mined, managed and administered by Ripple Labs (instead of a broad-based community). On one hand, that gives the coin the benefits of Visa (NYSE:V) and other centralized payments processors. These include the ability to negotiate with large banks, execute trades quickly and control policies.\n\nOn the other hand, critics are right to question: \u201cWhy use a cryptocurrency in the first place then?\u201d\n\nXRP has also had its share of accounting issues. Specifically, in December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and two executives for selling XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Ripple also controls over half of the XRP supply.\n\nStill, XRP has enormous potential. The currency is used by financial institutions as an alternative to the SWIFT network, giving it a real-world application. And its low price-per-coin makes it a tempting target for punters \u2014 it\u2019s easier to see XRP rising 1,000% to $3.5 than BTC doing the same to $454,000.\n\nA well-placed contender to XRP\u2019s crown, Stellar offers low-cost, cross-border transactions.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $11 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 189%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n2021 is shaping to become Stellar\u2019s year. After lagging Bitcoin in 2020, Stellar surprised analysts and investors alike by rocketing 200% in the first week of January. The coin has continued to outperform expectations since.\n\nMuch of its success comes from XRP\u2019s misfortunes. Much like XRP, Stellar was designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. As regulatory issues mount for rival XRP, Stellar has quickly moved to fill the void. But some of it has also come down to luck. In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowed banks to start using independent node verification networks. The same week, the Ukrainian government announced a partnership with Stellar Development to create a national digital currency.\n\nAll this grants perfect investment conditions for Stellar, a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nCardano is the largest third-generation cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s packed with plenty more upside potential in 2021.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 441%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nADA, which runs on the Cardano network is one of the most technologically exciting cryptocurrencies to date. Its proof-of-stake system means it can operate more efficiently than the standard proof-of-work system. And its use of smart contracts means that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum. In short, it\u2019s a third-generation coin that improves on its predecessors.\n\nADA/Cardano still has plenty of work to do in the year ahead. After all, having a superior technological product means nothing if people won\u2019t adopt it. But three key areas make it a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nFirst, ADA has momentum. The currency took just three years to hit a $10 billion market cap \u2014 one-third the time it took Bitcoin to do the same. Second, it sits at just 30 cents per coin, making it a tempting target for punters to run up. Finally, it has the ability to handle transactions and smart contracts. This makes it a natural enhancement for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nAn internet meme turned cryptocurrency, Dogecoin teaches the world about making money.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $7 billionYear Established: 2013Cost Per Transaction: 3 cents2020 Return: 118%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2013, IBM (NYSE:IBM) software engineer Billy Markus founded Dogecoin as a meme joke. And like most memes, Dogecoin saw its 15 minutes of fame. In 2017, DOGE briefly rocketed 85,000% as the internet found its new amusement; it subsequently lost 98% of its value.\n\nBut in the world of cryptocurrencies and memes alike, second acts DO exist. In December 2020, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sent Dogecoin back up 200% in a week simply by tweeting about it. As 2021 rolls around, this newfound popularity could send the coin up to speculative heights. Dogecoin does have its merits: its faster block time makes it better at processing payments than Bitcoin can. But in an asset class where popularity trounces usability any day of the week, Dogecoin could quickly return 1,000%.\n\nJust make sure you take your profits.\n\nAlong with Cardano/ADA, Polkadot is another promising third-generation cryptocurrency to consider.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 205%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn December, Binance announced a $10 million fund to support projects on Polkadot, a new cryptocurrency. DOT\u2019s price shot up 41% within a week. And more gains could be on the way.\n\nFounded by Gavin Wood, the Chief Technology Officer of the Ethereum Project, its protocol improves on older blockchains. From a technological standpoint, Polkadot\u2019s key difference is its use of parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that can run in parallel. That solves a massive issue for Bitcoin, which has a single, growing blockchain that all miners (and transactors) need to store. Developers have also added scalability, smart contracts and security.\n\nStill, investors need to remember that, in the world of cryptocurrencies, the best technologies aren\u2019t always the winners \u2014 it will take strong marketing (and some luck) to get Polkadot to rival its larger competitors.\n\nNEO \u2014 \u201cthe Chinese Ethereum\u201d \u2014 looks set to shine if the Chinese Communist Party allows it.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $3 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 63%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by NEO\u2019s sleepy looking returns in 2020. NEO (formerly known as Antshares) is one of China\u2019s earliest and largest cryptocurrency ventures. The coin fell hard in 2018 as the Chinese government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. But in 2021, the coin staged a remarkable resurgence as Chinese regulators turned their ire to Ant Group, a payments processor.\n\nWith the Chinese Communist Party now rethinking its stance on cryptocurrencies, NEO has a chance to shine once again.\n\nLender Celsius is a cryptocurrency with the potential to become a bank.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2018Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 3,717%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2018, Celsius Network crowdfunded $20 million to create a cryptocurrency lending platform. Since then, the network has written $6.2 billion in loans and produced $11 million in interest income, making it more like a bank than a currency. And by registering as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Celsius has soared even as other regulatory related currencies like XRP have struggled. In fact, its 2020 return was one of the highest of any other coin.\n\nStill, Celsius has plenty of risk for potential investors. As companies from Bear Stearns to Lehman Brothers found, bad loans can quickly threaten the stability of an entire lending operation. And the Celsius Network has raised red flags in the past, particularly with its unclear collateral requirements. In other words, Celsius could also blow up like a bank if they don\u2019t have the right controls in place.\n\nNevertheless, CEL could still continue to rise.

It\u2019s a formula that sounds good in theory.\n\nFrom an investor standpoint, however, Chainlink\u2019s complexity has worked against it. Making use of the protocol still requires hardcore programming knowledge, and that shrinks its potential audience. What Chainlink needs is a strong sponsor \u2014 a business like Ripple Labs, for example \u2014 to market and implement its smart contracts as required.\n\nIf the currency can find that sponsor, LINK will soar. Otherwise, investors can expect the currency to stall in 2021 as newer smart-contract coins take over.\n\nLisk is an early delegated proof-of-stake coin that was bested by competitors.

Built on JavaScript, one of the most common programming languages, Lisk promised to open application developments to a far wider range of developers.\n\nThe optimism, however, didn\u2019t last. As Lisk\u2019s programming issues began to emerge, the coin\u2019s price began to sink \u2014 certain quirks in its programming language made it relatively inefficient and prone to non-deterministic behavior. By 2017, LSK had shed almost all its value to settle at just 10 cents. And despite a second massive run-up in the 2018 cryptocurrency bubble, the coin has since settled back, dropping off the top-100 coin charts by market cap.\n\nInterest in the coin, however, has refused to completely disappear. Earlier this year, Robinhood added Lisk to its list of tracked cryptocurrencies, sending prices up over 250%. That means, while Lisk might have significant technological issues, renewed interest in the coin could incentivize developers back to the drawing board to improve the coin. If that happens (and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d), Lisk could quickly regain strength and challenge the larger coins once again.\n\nMonero is the No. 1 privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $4 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: 4 cents2020 Return: 244%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMonero has long been a favored coin for its privacy applications.

Like Dai/MakerDAO and other cryptocurrencies that rely on other blockchains, OMG has had trouble raising enough interest to create life of its own. Still, it\u2019s one of the handful of coins Robinhood tracks, making it a potential smaller break-out coin for 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t expect fireworks.

At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon.

Tesla\u2019s tenacious CEO took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to tweet about the coin, writing \u201cno highs, no lows, only Doge\u201d along with a Lion King meme with the Shiba Inu dog on Simba\u2019s face.\n\nNot long after this, Dogecoin\u2019s price skyrocketed, surging more than 800% in 24 hours. Other billionaires and pop culture icons like Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg got in on the action, tweeting about the currency as well.\n\nDogecoin is proof of the radical shift in market power with people participating in the rally for a sense of community. Although the coin has no intrinsic value like stocks or bonds, investors are rallying together to get its value to $1. The Dogecoin phenomenon is a case study in how culture and technology have the ability to literally move markets. Just as we saw in GameStop stock\u2019s meteoric rally last month.\n\nDogecoin has dipped 20% since its Feb. 7 high of 0.087159. Nevertheless, the currency is still up 1,350% this year with a market value of $8 billion. While many have expressed enthusiasm about the currency, others remain cautious.\n\nAn article by MarketWatch explains that unlike traditional Bitcoin which is limited in supply, Dogecoin has no built-in limit. This means that it can be mined for hundreds or thousands at any given time. Ultimately, the currency value is the result of a mass-market movement that remains untethered.\n\nSo the currency, as it stands, is largely speculative. Billy Markus, the founder of Dogecoin, recently stated the rally is \u201cnot something (he) can comprehend.\u201d He likened the rally to that of stocks like GameStop and AMC (NYSE:AMC) \u2014 both of which have cooled down considerably from their highs. Many researchers have also urged investors to exercise greater caution when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin.\n\nThe rise in the currency\u2019s price can serve as a real temptation to investors but its long-term growth remains unsustainable. On one hand, the currency is a great investment alternative in an environment where interest rates are close to zero. But on the flip side, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional investments, Bitcoin is disproportionately controlled with 95% of the currency controlled by just 2% of the market.\n\nThe recent rally in Dogecoin is a testament to the power of memes. While the price spikes are definitely attractive, it\u2019s also worth noting that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. According to Garrick Hileman of blockchain.com, Dogecoin could lose 90% of its value.\n\nWith this being a real possibility (as we saw with GME and AMC stock), I wouldn\u2019t go all-in on Dogecoin. However, if you want to be a part of the mass market movement, Dogecoin does trade on the cheap and is worth a small investment. Even if things don\u2019t go your way, it could serve as a great learning opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya Premkumar has a finance degree from the University of Houston, Texas.

The second-ranked crypto just set a new all-time high above $2,000.\n\nEthereum has broken a key psychological resistance barrier at $2,000.\n\nETH has crossed $2,000 for the first time. It\u2019s trading at $2,014 at the time of writing.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nThe digital asset has experienced a violent rise in recent weeks. On Jan. 4, it crossed $1,000 amid a flurry of activity across the crypto markets.\n\nThe run then intensified, with ETH touching $1,430 on Jan. 19, a record high at the time. ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run. ETH often outperforms BTC, however. It\u2019s up roughly 175% year-to-date, while BTC is up 89%.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has also had various wins of its own recently. On Feb. 8, ETH futures launched on CME Group, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange.\n\nThe NFT space, which runs on top of Ethereum, has also enjoyed a boom this year. Several notable celebrities and musicians have piled into the craze, among them Mark Cuban, Logan Paul, and Soulja Boy. This week, iconic auction house Christie\u2019s announced its plans to list an NFT by Beeple. They\u2019ll accept ETH in the auction.\n\nDeFi, meanwhile, continues to grow. There\u2019s over $43 billion locked in DeFi protocols today, according to DeFi Pulse. Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021. Described as an ETH buyback mechanism by EIP-1559 Tim Beiko, the update will see gas fees get burned to reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is now $232.8 billion.\n\nOriginal Post\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum fundamentals signal $2,000 ETH price is closer than it seems", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Cointelegraph", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/K.YZ2ppfF8jyenUdBuQnZA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/f0b2a0af24fd35f1926c73144b285c38", "auther": "", "body": "In the early hours of Feb. 15, Ether (ETH) price plunged to $1,660, followed by a 9% recovery within 10 hours. The move triggered $280 million in futures contracts liquidations, indicating excessive leverage from longs.\n\nAlthough the initial anxiety regarding CME's ETH futures launch on Feb. 8 seems to have faded, sustained excessive transaction fees might have undermined investors' confidence. Nevertheless, the fundamentals behind Ethereum remain solid, indicating ETH price should promptly recover from eventual dips.\n\nEven though the above metric might be interpreted positively, not every user can afford a $12 fee. A simple token swap on decentralized exchanges (DEX) can cost hundreds of dollars in gas fees, leaving small traders no choice but to abandon the network.\n\nMultiple proponents are testing sharding and layer-two solutions to circumvent this issue, including Skale and Optimistic Network. Eth2 will use sharding to split the blockchain into several parts and increase the number of transactions the network can process at once.\n\nThe phenomenal growth of total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance projects can't be disregarded. The adjusted metric attempts to clean readings from ETH price increases, therefore providing more reliable data.\n\nAs depicted above, the 34% increase over the past 30 days falls in line with ETH's 38% gain in February. Regardless of the transaction fees, there is still value created by automated market-making pools and staking mechanisms.\n\nTo better understand whether the recent crash reflects a potential local top and subsequent downtrend movement, one needs further data. Besides price action and technical analysis, investors should also gauge on-chain metrics such as network use. An excellent place to start is analyzing transactions and transfer value.\n\nCoin Metrics data shows the 14-day average transactions and transfers rallying above $9 billion in daily transactions, a 32% increase from the previous month. This significant increase in transaction and transfer value signals strength and suggests that Ether's price is sustainable at the current levels.\n\nAlthough there is no consensus among analysts on the short-term price impact of exchange withdrawals, its effect is either neutral or bullish. The opposite movement, large continuous inflows, is the only bearish scenario, as it indicates holders' willingness to sell.\n\nFrom Jan. 1 to Feb. 15, roughly 600,000 ETH was withdrawn from exchanges. Regardless of if whales are transferring to cold wallets or putting Ether into the DeFi ecosystem, those coins are less likely to be sold in the short term.\n\nConsidering this movement happened while Ethereum made a $1,870 all-time high, the indicator indicates holders' confidence. \n\nTo conclude, based on both on-chain metrics and trading perspective, there are encouraging signals that $2,000 is within reach and that dips are being bought up aggressively.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general.

Meanwhile, one popular cryptocurrency trader explains that this is \"simple math\" given the growing institutional demand for BTC.\u00a0\n\nWhile ETH is beating BTC in USD terms year-to-date, Bitcoin is gaining steam in February, up 60% compared to Ether's 50%.\u00a0\n\nEther did rally by roughly 6% over the last 24 hours as Grayscale added 20,000 ETH to its Ethereum Trust.\u00a0However, Grayscale's BTC stash is worth $34 billion, which dwarfs its ETH holdings of $5.8 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, a pseudonymous trader known as Bitcoin Jack noted that despite these latest ETH inflows, one single entity, namely MicroStrategy, is adding 20,000 BTC\u00a0worth almost $1 billion to its balance sheet.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Bitcointreasuries, companies are currently holding over 1.2 million BTC worth over $48 billion dollars \u2014 and that figure does not yet\u00a0include Tesla.\u00a0\n\nIn other words, there is a big difference between the amount of Bitcoin that is being acquired by institutions compared to Ether. Based on this trend, the trader said BTC outperforming ETH is not a surprise. He said:\n\nIn the near term, one variable that could catalyze a larger accumulation trend for Ether is the listing of Ethereum futures by CME. As Cointelegraph reported, CME listed Ethereum futures on Feb. 9, the day ETH broke out and achieved a new all-time high.\n\nIt has been less than two weeks since the CME Ethereum futures market launched, and many trading desks and institutions are likely still in the process of preparing their infrastructure. Hence, the actual demand and trading volume for ETH in the CME Ethereum futures market will likely take time to grow, as seen with Bitcoin, until funds begin actively trading the asset.\n\nAt the same time, with the cryptocurrency bull market is in full, major investment funds and retail investors may be experiencing FOMO, according to Paolo Ardoino, the CTO at Bitfinex. He explained:\n\nLastly, one major factor that underpins Bitcoin's \"digital store of value\" proposition is the capped supply of BTC contrary to the unknown total supply of Ether. Therefore, besides the brand image, this digital scarcity aspect is likely what's driving institutions first and foremost to Bitcoin. \n\nMeanwhile, other cryptocurrencies like ETH remain alternatives or \"altcoins\" and are typically considered for the purpose of diversifying, albeit in much smaller amounts if any, as exemplified by Grayscale's holdings.\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Two NYC bars are for sale \u2014 asking price is 25 bitcoin", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/pf.E1D0Bf9xAOkzuMDgcHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/62f05ae0-7302-11eb-bfbf-f3b92472ae90", "auther": "Alexis Christoforous", "body": "A long-time restaurant owner in New York City is looking to sell his two bars for bitcoin.

Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion.

Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven.

Ask them about cryptocurrency predictions for 2021. As Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), XRP (CCC:XRP-USD) and others have rocketed in value, never before has Wall Street seemed so hesitant about \u201cdigital gold,\u201d a name they use to invoke a margin of safety.\n\nBut as any experienced crypto investor knows, that\u2019s not the way cryptocurrencies work. Instead, it\u2019s a digital popularity contest where winners keep winning and losers bite the dust.\n\nSo, which cryptocurrencies can make you rich in 2021?\n\nTo answer that question, we need to explore the world of altcoins \u2014 up-and-coming coins that you can buy for cheap. That\u2019s because it pays to get in early. For example, $1,000 invested in Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) would be worth $3.3 million today. Meanwhile, $1,000 invested in Bitcoin today might earn \u201cjust\u201d 4-5x upside if you believe JP Morgan\u2019s lofty $146,000 target price.\n\nBut there are also significant risks because cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. Instead, their worth comes from their users. The more users a coin has, the more useful it becomes, and the higher its price goes. But when a coin falls out of favor, there\u2019s nothing to stop it from going to zero. That means investing in cryptocurrency requires strong belief that others will eventually buy it from you for even more.\n\nToday, people invest in crypto for one reason alone: to make money. So far, cryptocurrencies have delivered on that promise. Mom-and-pop investors have profited handsomely as Bitcoin and other currencies have rocketed in value.\n\nBut the risks in 2021 are growing \u2014 at their core, cryptocurrencies only serve to transfer wealth from one party to another. And some new competitors have recently popped up.\n\n\u201cChina has already developed a Central Bank-backed crypto, and in the U.S. it was discussed as part of the C-19 stimulus,\u201d writes Laura Gonzalez, Ph.D., associate professor of Finance at California State University, Long Beach. \u201cThere is ample evidence of speculation as well, and the value of the current cryptos will be affected by the upcoming central-bank backed digital currencies.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unregulated cryptocurrencies will one day compete against state-sponsored ones too.\n\nHere\u2019s the takeaway: if you have an extremely conservative portfolio and need to add \u201crisk-on\u201d assets, choosing a basket of top-rated cryptocurrencies could be right for you. It\u2019s a cheap way to gain massive macroeconomic risk exposure. But don\u2019t get fooled by thinking of crypto as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d If 2021 sees a surprise economic slowdown, no amount of hope will keep crypto afloat.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to take those risks, then you might want to start your search with the top 28 cryptocurrencies you need to know for 2021:\n\nWhile each has enormous potential, some are safer bets than others. As such, I\u2019ve organized the cryptocurrencies based on their overall risk-to-reward potential from most balanced to least. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at the wild world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum is a relative newcomer that has risen up the ranks thanks to its superior technology and its ability to create \u201csmart contracts.\u201d\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $200 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: $102020 Return: 470%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nEther, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is a technologically advanced version of Bitcoin that stands to grow even faster. Rather than hold itself as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d Ethereum runs on a series of contracts. That makes it more like Google Wallet or Apple Pay \u2014 a system that can approve or delay transactions based on real-world events. Online buyers and sellers, for instance, could set up trades that only follow through when the postal service independently verifies the delivery of goods.\n\nEthereum is also blazingly fast compared to Bitcoin: transactions only take 15 seconds to clear, rather than 15 minutes. Although trading costs are still high, its speed makes Ethereum useful for real-time use, rather than only as a store of value. Finally, Ethereum also has widespread adoption, with over 600,000 wallet addresses in use. As developers add services and protocols to make cryptocurrencies more useful, Ethereum looks set to keep winning.\n\nThese qualities have pushed Ethereum to my No. 1 spot in terms of risk-to-reward potential. Despite it having a later start than many other currencies, it has a winning combination of widespread usage, technological superiority and relative safety (compared to smaller coins, at least).\n\nBitcoin is the most widely adopted cryptocurrency. Although it\u2019s not the most technologically advanced, it continues to lead the pack.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $920 billionYear Established: 2009Cost Per Transaction: $152020 Return: 309%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe first successful cryptocurrency continues to lead the pack. With its first-mover advantage, Bitcoin not only won early name recognition. It also became the de-facto cryptocurrency for mainstream investors. Smaller investors can use Square (NYSE:SQ) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) services to buy as little as $1 (or as much as they can \u201chodl\u201d). Meanwhile, institutional investors can use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to transact millions of dollars in futures.\n\nThat makes Bitcoin an essential allocation. The world\u2019s No. 1 coin makes up close to two-thirds of the entire cryptocurrency market, providing liquidity between smaller altcoins. Its size also makes it resistant to 51% attacks, where large cryptocurrency miners attempt to use computing heft to try manipulating the blockchain.\n\nHowever, popular as it may be, Bitcoin has some downsides. As one of the earliest blockchains, Bitcoin\u2019s ledger is large and unwieldy. Transactions can cost $12 to complete and take over 15 minutes to clear. That\u2019s fine for its purpose as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d but it prevents BTC from use as a day-to-day currency. (People paying in Bitcoin will often use third-party services to transact small amounts).\n\nBitcoin is also extremely sensitive to macroeconomic movements \u2014 the currency lost half its value in the most recent U.S. stock market downturn. And if 2021 reveals a weak economic recovery or mutated strain of the novel coronavirus, Bitcoin could easily lose 50-80% of its value. But for those looking to invest in cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the most liquid option. It\u2019s an essential coin to hold, and one that receives top marks for in 2021.\n\nXRP is a centralized cryptocurrency that\u2019s geared toward taking out the high costs of inter-bank transfers.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $24 billionYear Established: 2012Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 16%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIf you could only bet on one cryptocurrency this year, XRP would be it. XRP is the largest currency to have 10x potential for 2021.\n\nXRP is the odd duckling of the cryptocurrency world. Founded by Ripple Labs, XRP is a centralized currency that\u2019s mined, managed and administered by Ripple Labs (instead of a broad-based community). On one hand, that gives the coin the benefits of Visa (NYSE:V) and other centralized payments processors. These include the ability to negotiate with large banks, execute trades quickly and control policies.\n\nOn the other hand, critics are right to question: \u201cWhy use a cryptocurrency in the first place then?\u201d\n\nXRP has also had its share of accounting issues. Specifically, in December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and two executives for selling XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Ripple also controls over half of the XRP supply.\n\nStill, XRP has enormous potential. The currency is used by financial institutions as an alternative to the SWIFT network, giving it a real-world application. And its low price-per-coin makes it a tempting target for punters \u2014 it\u2019s easier to see XRP rising 1,000% to $3.5 than BTC doing the same to $454,000.\n\nA well-placed contender to XRP\u2019s crown, Stellar offers low-cost, cross-border transactions.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $11 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 189%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n2021 is shaping to become Stellar\u2019s year. After lagging Bitcoin in 2020, Stellar surprised analysts and investors alike by rocketing 200% in the first week of January. The coin has continued to outperform expectations since.\n\nMuch of its success comes from XRP\u2019s misfortunes. Much like XRP, Stellar was designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. As regulatory issues mount for rival XRP, Stellar has quickly moved to fill the void. But some of it has also come down to luck. In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowed banks to start using independent node verification networks. The same week, the Ukrainian government announced a partnership with Stellar Development to create a national digital currency.\n\nAll this grants perfect investment conditions for Stellar, a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nCardano is the largest third-generation cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s packed with plenty more upside potential in 2021.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 441%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nADA, which runs on the Cardano network is one of the most technologically exciting cryptocurrencies to date. Its proof-of-stake system means it can operate more efficiently than the standard proof-of-work system. And its use of smart contracts means that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum. In short, it\u2019s a third-generation coin that improves on its predecessors.\n\nADA/Cardano still has plenty of work to do in the year ahead. After all, having a superior technological product means nothing if people won\u2019t adopt it. But three key areas make it a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nFirst, ADA has momentum. The currency took just three years to hit a $10 billion market cap \u2014 one-third the time it took Bitcoin to do the same. Second, it sits at just 30 cents per coin, making it a tempting target for punters to run up. Finally, it has the ability to handle transactions and smart contracts. This makes it a natural enhancement for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nAn internet meme turned cryptocurrency, Dogecoin teaches the world about making money.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $7 billionYear Established: 2013Cost Per Transaction: 3 cents2020 Return: 118%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2013, IBM (NYSE:IBM) software engineer Billy Markus founded Dogecoin as a meme joke. And like most memes, Dogecoin saw its 15 minutes of fame. In 2017, DOGE briefly rocketed 85,000% as the internet found its new amusement; it subsequently lost 98% of its value.\n\nBut in the world of cryptocurrencies and memes alike, second acts DO exist. In December 2020, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sent Dogecoin back up 200% in a week simply by tweeting about it. As 2021 rolls around, this newfound popularity could send the coin up to speculative heights. Dogecoin does have its merits: its faster block time makes it better at processing payments than Bitcoin can. But in an asset class where popularity trounces usability any day of the week, Dogecoin could quickly return 1,000%.\n\nJust make sure you take your profits.\n\nAlong with Cardano/ADA, Polkadot is another promising third-generation cryptocurrency to consider.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 205%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn December, Binance announced a $10 million fund to support projects on Polkadot, a new cryptocurrency. DOT\u2019s price shot up 41% within a week. And more gains could be on the way.\n\nFounded by Gavin Wood, the Chief Technology Officer of the Ethereum Project, its protocol improves on older blockchains. From a technological standpoint, Polkadot\u2019s key difference is its use of parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that can run in parallel. That solves a massive issue for Bitcoin, which has a single, growing blockchain that all miners (and transactors) need to store. Developers have also added scalability, smart contracts and security.\n\nStill, investors need to remember that, in the world of cryptocurrencies, the best technologies aren\u2019t always the winners \u2014 it will take strong marketing (and some luck) to get Polkadot to rival its larger competitors.\n\nNEO \u2014 \u201cthe Chinese Ethereum\u201d \u2014 looks set to shine if the Chinese Communist Party allows it.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $3 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 63%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by NEO\u2019s sleepy looking returns in 2020. NEO (formerly known as Antshares) is one of China\u2019s earliest and largest cryptocurrency ventures. The coin fell hard in 2018 as the Chinese government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. But in 2021, the coin staged a remarkable resurgence as Chinese regulators turned their ire to Ant Group, a payments processor.\n\nWith the Chinese Communist Party now rethinking its stance on cryptocurrencies, NEO has a chance to shine once again.\n\nLender Celsius is a cryptocurrency with the potential to become a bank.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2018Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 3,717%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2018, Celsius Network crowdfunded $20 million to create a cryptocurrency lending platform. Since then, the network has written $6.2 billion in loans and produced $11 million in interest income, making it more like a bank than a currency. And by registering as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Celsius has soared even as other regulatory related currencies like XRP have struggled. In fact, its 2020 return was one of the highest of any other coin.\n\nStill, Celsius has plenty of risk for potential investors. As companies from Bear Stearns to Lehman Brothers found, bad loans can quickly threaten the stability of an entire lending operation. And the Celsius Network has raised red flags in the past, particularly with its unclear collateral requirements. In other words, Celsius could also blow up like a bank if they don\u2019t have the right controls in place.\n\nNevertheless, CEL could still continue to rise. It\u2019s one of the largest pure-play P2P lenders in the crypto space, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in 2021.\n\nWant to have your own blockchain? Nano gives every user their own ledger.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: <$1 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: N/A2020 Return: 54%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nNano is a prime example of playing the cryptocurrency lottery. Having traded sideways in 2020, Nano suddenly jumped 400% in the first week of 2021. Why? Some may point to a December hack on an Italian cryptocurrency exchange. Others might point to Nano\u2019s reasonably superior technology. But in the microcap altcoin world, timing has far more to do with luck.\n\nHowever, now that demand is rising, keep watch. A short-term spike is often how new coins gain popularity. With its ability to assign entire blockchains to individual accounts, Nano looks like an attractive Bitcoin alternative.\n\nChainlink is a cryptocurrency that allows others to run smart contracts. But can LINK succeed on its own?\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $13 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 428%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nChainlink is as different as they come. Rather than operate its own blockchain, Chainlink runs smart contracts on other blockchains. That makes LINK an anomaly in the cryptocurrency world \u2014 a coin that\u2019s relatively agnostic to whichever blockchain it\u2019s working on. It\u2019s a formula that sounds good in theory.\n\nFrom an investor standpoint, however, Chainlink\u2019s complexity has worked against it. Making use of the protocol still requires hardcore programming knowledge, and that shrinks its potential audience. What Chainlink needs is a strong sponsor \u2014 a business like Ripple Labs, for example \u2014 to market and implement its smart contracts as required.\n\nIf the currency can find that sponsor, LINK will soar. Otherwise, investors can expect the currency to stall in 2021 as newer smart-contract coins take over.\n\nLisk is an early delegated proof-of-stake coin that was bested by competitors. Can it regain its strength?\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: <$1 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 104%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nLisk was launched in 2016 to a great deal of optimism. The delegated proof-of-stake coin initially priced at $8 as excited ICO investors saw LSK as an alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s issues. Built on JavaScript, one of the most common programming languages, Lisk promised to open application developments to a far wider range of developers.\n\nThe optimism, however, didn\u2019t last. As Lisk\u2019s programming issues began to emerge, the coin\u2019s price began to sink \u2014 certain quirks in its programming language made it relatively inefficient and prone to non-deterministic behavior. By 2017, LSK had shed almost all its value to settle at just 10 cents. And despite a second massive run-up in the 2018 cryptocurrency bubble, the coin has since settled back, dropping off the top-100 coin charts by market cap.\n\nInterest in the coin, however, has refused to completely disappear. Earlier this year, Robinhood added Lisk to its list of tracked cryptocurrencies, sending prices up over 250%. That means, while Lisk might have significant technological issues, renewed interest in the coin could incentivize developers back to the drawing board to improve the coin. If that happens (and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d), Lisk could quickly regain strength and challenge the larger coins once again.\n\nMonero is the No. 1 privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $4 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: 4 cents2020 Return: 244%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMonero has long been a favored coin for its privacy applications.

And its community has continued to improve its privacy \u2014 from improving its decoy transactions to obscuring recipient identities.\n\nBut Monero ran into early issues. Because transactions are so private, it quickly became a favorite of Darknet users looking to hide their tracks. After suffering a series of scandals, XMR\u2019s price plummeted in 2017. Yet, the cryptocurrency has had a revival in recent months. Since February, the currency has increased by almost 300% as privacy concerns have taken center stage.\n\nAs we move into 2021, XMR looks like a cryptocurrency with second-wind potential. Investors should take note.\n\nOMG is a coin built on the Ethereum network looks set to ride ETH\u2019s coattails\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 280%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nFounded in 2017, OMG Network was built to help Ethereum gain scale. Rather than run every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, the OMG network would use sidechains to group several transactions together before sending them to the main blockchain. These transactions are secured by OMG Network\u2019s coin, OMG.\n\nDespite its relative promise, however, investor interest in the OMG Network has been muted. Like Dai/MakerDAO and other cryptocurrencies that rely on other blockchains, OMG has had trouble raising enough interest to create life of its own. Still, it\u2019s one of the handful of coins Robinhood tracks, making it a potential smaller break-out coin for 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t expect fireworks.

By the second week of February, QTUM had risen 270%.\n\nBut there\u2019s where the similarities begin to end. Unlike Lisk, which is written in the more-commonly used JavaScript, QTUM is written in far faster C. That has allowed its community to develop strong protocols that have kept up with many of Bitcoin\u2019s own modifications.\n\nQTUM remains a niche coin \u2014 as of the beginning of 2021, the cryptocurrency remains outside the top-50 by market cap. But as investors start to look further afield for interesting technologies, QTUM could see its moment to shine.\n\nWith its value linked 1:1 to the U.S. Dollar, Tether is useful for short-term holdings.

That makes Tether useful as 1) a currency, 2) a short-term savings tool and 3) a method of arbitrage between different exchanges.\n\nAs a long-term investment, however, it\u2019s not particularly interesting. Tether\u2019s value won\u2019t ever deviate far from $1. Past accounting scandals have also threatened the coin\u2019s stability. In 2017, the coin dropped to 92 cents, and controversy seems to keep cropping up every couple of months.\n\nNevertheless, Tether is still useful for transferring cryptocurrency between wallets without major price risk. And with many exchanges now offering up to 12% interest on stablecoins, it\u2019s a currency that still shouldn\u2019t get overlooked in 2021.\n\nAs the largest \u201cBitcoin clone,\u201d Litecoin still hasn\u2019t managed a life of its own.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $8 billionYear Established: 2011Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 200%Score: \u2605\u2605\n\nLitecoin is the largest of the \u201cBitcoin clones,\u201d making it far more understandable for most investors.

That has made the younger fork cheaper and faster than Bitcoin to verify. Litecoin\u2019s size also makes it less vulnerable to a \u201c51% attack\u201d than other Bitcoin-like currencies.\n\nMy two-star rating comes down to momentum. Although it was once a popular Bitcoin alternative, Litecoin has since struggled to differentiate itself from its bigger brother.

Its 2020 returns have reflected that truth.\n\nAs investors look to 2021, Bitcoin SV remains a player that\u2019s likely a \u201cpass.\u201d The cryptocurrency, unfortunately, has too little name recognition and too little differentiation from Bitcoin.\n\nEOS is a new cryptocurrency entrant, but little technological differentiation makes it a low-potential coin.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $2 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 1%Score: \u2605\n\nEOS, the currency of the EOS.IO protocol, has mostly traded sideways throughout its history. As a currency, it looks much like Ethereum\u2019s network, with several improvements in the way transactions are approved. But as an investment, it has remained somewhat of a disappointment.\n\nWhile EOS makes the list because of its relatively large size, investors looking at this lesser-known coin should watch for any significant uptake news before investing.\n\nVeChain is a Chinese cryptocurrency helping track food safety.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: N/A2020 Return: 260%Score: \u2605\n\nVeChain is a Chinese-based cryptocurrency that works with food groups to track food and safety. In July 2019, it inked a deal with Walmart China for its Blockchain Food Safety program. And in September 2020, it joined forces with a Chinese food safety group that includes McDonald\u2019s China.\n\nWhile its trajectory still seems unclear, these wins have helped its placement on this list, making VeChain a nominal coin to track.\n\nDai is a stablecoin that\u2019s greasing the wheels of the Ethereum network.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 0%Score: \u2605\n\nLike Tether, Dai is a stablecoin whose value is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. Dollar.

In the past, it has also allowed savers to earn up to 8.75% interest. The rate has since dropped to zero.\n\nThat\u2019s why investors looking for simple buy-and-hold altcoins should consider Tether instead.

Put another way, the proverbial $1,000 invested in Ethereum last year would now be worth about $7,000.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Source: Shutterstock\n\n\nIn early February, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) introduced futures contracts in Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, which started in 2015 as a programmable blockchain. Such futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell Ether at a predetermined price at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace\u00a0contributor Vivian Medithi covered the topic earlier this month and highlighted, \u201cAnalysts expect to see increased institutional investment in ether as a result of the introduction of futures contracts, bolstering the recent bullish run in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s move comes about three years after its December 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures. At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon. So as a small allocation to a portfolio, it could be worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

A Shiba Inu-themed cryptocurrency that was the brainchild of two software engineers has taken the investing world by storm. After years of being overshadowed by more popular coins like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) and Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD), Dogecoin got its turn in the spotlight after Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) billionaire boss tweeted \u201cWho let the Doge out.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 29 the currency was up 800%, becoming the \u201ccrypto (GameStop (NYSE:GME) gme\u201d according to one Reddit user. A seemingly unknown coin now has the internet abuzz. If there\u2019s one lesson we can learn from this, it\u2019s that memes and tweets have the power to move markets.\n\nAlthough many may have heard about Dogecoin for the first time in the last couple of weeks, the cryptocurrency has actually been around since 2013. The coin was the product of a joke by two software engineers who wanted to pay homage to Bitcoin\u2019s then-questionable reputation. A coin that meant to garner nothing more than a few laughs has now become the face of the cryptocurrency industry. Its claim to fame is the result of a series of tweets and memes.\n\nFor reasons that still remain unclear, Dogecoin caught the attention of billionaire Elon Musk. Tesla\u2019s tenacious CEO took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to tweet about the coin, writing \u201cno highs, no lows, only Doge\u201d along with a Lion King meme with the Shiba Inu dog on Simba\u2019s face.\n\nNot long after this, Dogecoin\u2019s price skyrocketed, surging more than 800% in 24 hours. Other billionaires and pop culture icons like Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg got in on the action, tweeting about the currency as well.\n\nDogecoin is proof of the radical shift in market power with people participating in the rally for a sense of community. Although the coin has no intrinsic value like stocks or bonds, investors are rallying together to get its value to $1. The Dogecoin phenomenon is a case study in how culture and technology have the ability to literally move markets. Just as we saw in GameStop stock\u2019s meteoric rally last month.\n\nDogecoin has dipped 20% since its Feb. 7 high of 0.087159. Nevertheless, the currency is still up 1,350% this year with a market value of $8 billion. While many have expressed enthusiasm about the currency, others remain cautious.\n\nAn article by MarketWatch explains that unlike traditional Bitcoin which is limited in supply, Dogecoin has no built-in limit. This means that it can be mined for hundreds or thousands at any given time. Ultimately, the currency value is the result of a mass-market movement that remains untethered.\n\nSo the currency, as it stands, is largely speculative. Billy Markus, the founder of Dogecoin, recently stated the rally is \u201cnot something (he) can comprehend.\u201d He likened the rally to that of stocks like GameStop and AMC (NYSE:AMC) \u2014 both of which have cooled down considerably from their highs. Many researchers have also urged investors to exercise greater caution when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin.\n\nThe rise in the currency\u2019s price can serve as a real temptation to investors but its long-term growth remains unsustainable. On one hand, the currency is a great investment alternative in an environment where interest rates are close to zero. But on the flip side, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional investments, Bitcoin is disproportionately controlled with 95% of the currency controlled by just 2% of the market.\n\nThe recent rally in Dogecoin is a testament to the power of memes. While the price spikes are definitely attractive, it\u2019s also worth noting that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. According to Garrick Hileman of blockchain.com, Dogecoin could lose 90% of its value.\n\nWith this being a real possibility (as we saw with GME and AMC stock), I wouldn\u2019t go all-in on Dogecoin. However, if you want to be a part of the mass market movement, Dogecoin does trade on the cheap and is worth a small investment. Even if things don\u2019t go your way, it could serve as a great learning opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya Premkumar has a finance degree from the University of Houston, Texas.

There\u2019s over $43 billion locked in DeFi protocols today, according to DeFi Pulse. Despite competition from growing platforms like Polkadot, DeFi mostly centers around the Ethereum ecosystem today.\n\nOne major Ethereum development on the horizon is the EIP-1559 update, which could drop by the end of 2021.

The move triggered $280 million in futures contracts liquidations, indicating excessive leverage from longs.\n\nAlthough the initial anxiety regarding CME's ETH futures launch on Feb. 8 seems to have faded, sustained excessive transaction fees might have undermined investors' confidence. Nevertheless, the fundamentals behind Ethereum remain solid, indicating ETH price should promptly recover from eventual dips.\n\nEven though the above metric might be interpreted positively, not every user can afford a $12 fee. A simple token swap on decentralized exchanges (DEX) can cost hundreds of dollars in gas fees, leaving small traders no choice but to abandon the network.\n\nMultiple proponents are testing sharding and layer-two solutions to circumvent this issue, including Skale and Optimistic Network. Eth2 will use sharding to split the blockchain into several parts and increase the number of transactions the network can process at once.\n\nThe phenomenal growth of total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance projects can't be disregarded. The adjusted metric attempts to clean readings from ETH price increases, therefore providing more reliable data.\n\nAs depicted above, the 34% increase over the past 30 days falls in line with ETH's 38% gain in February. Regardless of the transaction fees, there is still value created by automated market-making pools and staking mechanisms.\n\nTo better understand whether the recent crash reflects a potential local top and subsequent downtrend movement, one needs further data. Besides price action and technical analysis, investors should also gauge on-chain metrics such as network use. An excellent place to start is analyzing transactions and transfer value.\n\nCoin Metrics data shows the 14-day average transactions and transfers rallying above $9 billion in daily transactions, a 32% increase from the previous month. This significant increase in transaction and transfer value signals strength and suggests that Ether's price is sustainable at the current levels.\n\nAlthough there is no consensus among analysts on the short-term price impact of exchange withdrawals, its effect is either neutral or bullish. The opposite movement, large continuous inflows, is the only bearish scenario, as it indicates holders' willingness to sell.\n\nFrom Jan. 1 to Feb. 15, roughly 600,000 ETH was withdrawn from exchanges. Regardless of if whales are transferring to cold wallets or putting Ether into the DeFi ecosystem, those coins are less likely to be sold in the short term.\n\nConsidering this movement happened while Ethereum made a $1,870 all-time high, the indicator indicates holders' confidence. \n\nTo conclude, based on both on-chain metrics and trading perspective, there are encouraging signals that $2,000 is within reach and that dips are being bought up aggressively.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general.

Meanwhile, one popular cryptocurrency trader explains that this is \"simple math\" given the growing institutional demand for BTC.\u00a0\n\nWhile ETH is beating BTC in USD terms year-to-date, Bitcoin is gaining steam in February, up 60% compared to Ether's 50%.\u00a0\n\nEther did rally by roughly 6% over the last 24 hours as Grayscale added 20,000 ETH to its Ethereum Trust.\u00a0However, Grayscale's BTC stash is worth $34 billion, which dwarfs its ETH holdings of $5.8 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, a pseudonymous trader known as Bitcoin Jack noted that despite these latest ETH inflows, one single entity, namely MicroStrategy, is adding 20,000 BTC\u00a0worth almost $1 billion to its balance sheet.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Bitcointreasuries, companies are currently holding over 1.2 million BTC worth over $48 billion dollars \u2014 and that figure does not yet\u00a0include Tesla.\u00a0\n\nIn other words, there is a big difference between the amount of Bitcoin that is being acquired by institutions compared to Ether. Based on this trend, the trader said BTC outperforming ETH is not a surprise. He said:\n\nIn the near term, one variable that could catalyze a larger accumulation trend for Ether is the listing of Ethereum futures by CME. As Cointelegraph reported, CME listed Ethereum futures on Feb. 9, the day ETH broke out and achieved a new all-time high.\n\nIt has been less than two weeks since the CME Ethereum futures market launched, and many trading desks and institutions are likely still in the process of preparing their infrastructure. Hence, the actual demand and trading volume for ETH in the CME Ethereum futures market will likely take time to grow, as seen with Bitcoin, until funds begin actively trading the asset.\n\nAt the same time, with the cryptocurrency bull market is in full, major investment funds and retail investors may be experiencing FOMO, according to Paolo Ardoino, the CTO at Bitfinex. He explained:\n\nLastly, one major factor that underpins Bitcoin's \"digital store of value\" proposition is the capped supply of BTC contrary to the unknown total supply of Ether. Therefore, besides the brand image, this digital scarcity aspect is likely what's driving institutions first and foremost to Bitcoin. \n\nMeanwhile, other cryptocurrencies like ETH remain alternatives or \"altcoins\" and are typically considered for the purpose of diversifying, albeit in much smaller amounts if any, as exemplified by Grayscale's holdings.\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Two NYC bars are for sale \u2014 asking price is 25 bitcoin", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/pf.E1D0Bf9xAOkzuMDgcHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/62f05ae0-7302-11eb-bfbf-f3b92472ae90", "auther": "Alexis Christoforous", "body": "A long-time restaurant owner in New York City is looking to sell his two bars for bitcoin. Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Ask them about cryptocurrency predictions for 2021. As Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), XRP (CCC:XRP-USD) and others have rocketed in value, never before has Wall Street seemed so hesitant about \u201cdigital gold,\u201d a name they use to invoke a margin of safety.\n\nBut as any experienced crypto investor knows, that\u2019s not the way cryptocurrencies work. Instead, it\u2019s a digital popularity contest where winners keep winning and losers bite the dust.\n\nSo, which cryptocurrencies can make you rich in 2021?\n\nTo answer that question, we need to explore the world of altcoins \u2014 up-and-coming coins that you can buy for cheap. That\u2019s because it pays to get in early. For example, $1,000 invested in Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) would be worth $3.3 million today. Meanwhile, $1,000 invested in Bitcoin today might earn \u201cjust\u201d 4-5x upside if you believe JP Morgan\u2019s lofty $146,000 target price.\n\nBut there are also significant risks because cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. Instead, their worth comes from their users. The more users a coin has, the more useful it becomes, and the higher its price goes. But when a coin falls out of favor, there\u2019s nothing to stop it from going to zero. That means investing in cryptocurrency requires strong belief that others will eventually buy it from you for even more.\n\nToday, people invest in crypto for one reason alone: to make money. So far, cryptocurrencies have delivered on that promise. Mom-and-pop investors have profited handsomely as Bitcoin and other currencies have rocketed in value.\n\nBut the risks in 2021 are growing \u2014 at their core, cryptocurrencies only serve to transfer wealth from one party to another. And some new competitors have recently popped up.\n\n\u201cChina has already developed a Central Bank-backed crypto, and in the U.S. it was discussed as part of the C-19 stimulus,\u201d writes Laura Gonzalez, Ph.D., associate professor of Finance at California State University, Long Beach. \u201cThere is ample evidence of speculation as well, and the value of the current cryptos will be affected by the upcoming central-bank backed digital currencies.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unregulated cryptocurrencies will one day compete against state-sponsored ones too.\n\nHere\u2019s the takeaway: if you have an extremely conservative portfolio and need to add \u201crisk-on\u201d assets, choosing a basket of top-rated cryptocurrencies could be right for you. It\u2019s a cheap way to gain massive macroeconomic risk exposure. But don\u2019t get fooled by thinking of crypto as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d If 2021 sees a surprise economic slowdown, no amount of hope will keep crypto afloat.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to take those risks, then you might want to start your search with the top 28 cryptocurrencies you need to know for 2021:\n\nWhile each has enormous potential, some are safer bets than others. As such, I\u2019ve organized the cryptocurrencies based on their overall risk-to-reward potential from most balanced to least. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at the wild world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum is a relative newcomer that has risen up the ranks thanks to its superior technology and its ability to create \u201csmart contracts.\u201d\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $200 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: $102020 Return: 470%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nEther, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is a technologically advanced version of Bitcoin that stands to grow even faster. Rather than hold itself as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d Ethereum runs on a series of contracts. That makes it more like Google Wallet or Apple Pay \u2014 a system that can approve or delay transactions based on real-world events. Online buyers and sellers, for instance, could set up trades that only follow through when the postal service independently verifies the delivery of goods.\n\nEthereum is also blazingly fast compared to Bitcoin: transactions only take 15 seconds to clear, rather than 15 minutes. Although trading costs are still high, its speed makes Ethereum useful for real-time use, rather than only as a store of value. Finally, Ethereum also has widespread adoption, with over 600,000 wallet addresses in use. As developers add services and protocols to make cryptocurrencies more useful, Ethereum looks set to keep winning.\n\nThese qualities have pushed Ethereum to my No. 1 spot in terms of risk-to-reward potential. Despite it having a later start than many other currencies, it has a winning combination of widespread usage, technological superiority and relative safety (compared to smaller coins, at least).\n\nBitcoin is the most widely adopted cryptocurrency. Although it\u2019s not the most technologically advanced, it continues to lead the pack.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $920 billionYear Established: 2009Cost Per Transaction: $152020 Return: 309%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe first successful cryptocurrency continues to lead the pack. With its first-mover advantage, Bitcoin not only won early name recognition. It also became the de-facto cryptocurrency for mainstream investors. Smaller investors can use Square (NYSE:SQ) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) services to buy as little as $1 (or as much as they can \u201chodl\u201d). Meanwhile, institutional investors can use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to transact millions of dollars in futures.\n\nThat makes Bitcoin an essential allocation. The world\u2019s No. 1 coin makes up close to two-thirds of the entire cryptocurrency market, providing liquidity between smaller altcoins. Its size also makes it resistant to 51% attacks, where large cryptocurrency miners attempt to use computing heft to try manipulating the blockchain.\n\nHowever, popular as it may be, Bitcoin has some downsides. As one of the earliest blockchains, Bitcoin\u2019s ledger is large and unwieldy. Transactions can cost $12 to complete and take over 15 minutes to clear. That\u2019s fine for its purpose as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d but it prevents BTC from use as a day-to-day currency. (People paying in Bitcoin will often use third-party services to transact small amounts).\n\nBitcoin is also extremely sensitive to macroeconomic movements \u2014 the currency lost half its value in the most recent U.S. stock market downturn. And if 2021 reveals a weak economic recovery or mutated strain of the novel coronavirus, Bitcoin could easily lose 50-80% of its value. But for those looking to invest in cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the most liquid option. It\u2019s an essential coin to hold, and one that receives top marks for in 2021.\n\nXRP is a centralized cryptocurrency that\u2019s geared toward taking out the high costs of inter-bank transfers.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $24 billionYear Established: 2012Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 16%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIf you could only bet on one cryptocurrency this year, XRP would be it. XRP is the largest currency to have 10x potential for 2021.\n\nXRP is the odd duckling of the cryptocurrency world. Founded by Ripple Labs, XRP is a centralized currency that\u2019s mined, managed and administered by Ripple Labs (instead of a broad-based community). On one hand, that gives the coin the benefits of Visa (NYSE:V) and other centralized payments processors. These include the ability to negotiate with large banks, execute trades quickly and control policies.\n\nOn the other hand, critics are right to question: \u201cWhy use a cryptocurrency in the first place then?\u201d\n\nXRP has also had its share of accounting issues. Specifically, in December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and two executives for selling XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Ripple also controls over half of the XRP supply.\n\nStill, XRP has enormous potential. The currency is used by financial institutions as an alternative to the SWIFT network, giving it a real-world application. And its low price-per-coin makes it a tempting target for punters \u2014 it\u2019s easier to see XRP rising 1,000% to $3.5 than BTC doing the same to $454,000.\n\nA well-placed contender to XRP\u2019s crown, Stellar offers low-cost, cross-border transactions.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $11 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 189%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n2021 is shaping to become Stellar\u2019s year. After lagging Bitcoin in 2020, Stellar surprised analysts and investors alike by rocketing 200% in the first week of January. The coin has continued to outperform expectations since.\n\nMuch of its success comes from XRP\u2019s misfortunes. Much like XRP, Stellar was designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. As regulatory issues mount for rival XRP, Stellar has quickly moved to fill the void. But some of it has also come down to luck. In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowed banks to start using independent node verification networks. The same week, the Ukrainian government announced a partnership with Stellar Development to create a national digital currency.\n\nAll this grants perfect investment conditions for Stellar, a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nCardano is the largest third-generation cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s packed with plenty more upside potential in 2021.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 441%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nADA, which runs on the Cardano network is one of the most technologically exciting cryptocurrencies to date. Its proof-of-stake system means it can operate more efficiently than the standard proof-of-work system. And its use of smart contracts means that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum. In short, it\u2019s a third-generation coin that improves on its predecessors.\n\nADA/Cardano still has plenty of work to do in the year ahead. After all, having a superior technological product means nothing if people won\u2019t adopt it. But three key areas make it a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nFirst, ADA has momentum. The currency took just three years to hit a $10 billion market cap \u2014 one-third the time it took Bitcoin to do the same. Second, it sits at just 30 cents per coin, making it a tempting target for punters to run up. Finally, it has the ability to handle transactions and smart contracts. This makes it a natural enhancement for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nAn internet meme turned cryptocurrency, Dogecoin teaches the world about making money.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $7 billionYear Established: 2013Cost Per Transaction: 3 cents2020 Return: 118%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2013, IBM (NYSE:IBM) software engineer Billy Markus founded Dogecoin as a meme joke. And like most memes, Dogecoin saw its 15 minutes of fame. In 2017, DOGE briefly rocketed 85,000% as the internet found its new amusement; it subsequently lost 98% of its value.\n\nBut in the world of cryptocurrencies and memes alike, second acts DO exist. In December 2020, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sent Dogecoin back up 200% in a week simply by tweeting about it. As 2021 rolls around, this newfound popularity could send the coin up to speculative heights. Dogecoin does have its merits: its faster block time makes it better at processing payments than Bitcoin can. But in an asset class where popularity trounces usability any day of the week, Dogecoin could quickly return 1,000%.\n\nJust make sure you take your profits.\n\nAlong with Cardano/ADA, Polkadot is another promising third-generation cryptocurrency to consider.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 205%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn December, Binance announced a $10 million fund to support projects on Polkadot, a new cryptocurrency.

And more gains could be on the way.\n\nFounded by Gavin Wood, the Chief Technology Officer of the Ethereum Project, its protocol improves on older blockchains. From a technological standpoint, Polkadot\u2019s key difference is its use of parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that can run in parallel. That solves a massive issue for Bitcoin, which has a single, growing blockchain that all miners (and transactors) need to store. Developers have also added scalability, smart contracts and security.\n\nStill, investors need to remember that, in the world of cryptocurrencies, the best technologies aren\u2019t always the winners \u2014 it will take strong marketing (and some luck) to get Polkadot to rival its larger competitors.\n\nNEO \u2014 \u201cthe Chinese Ethereum\u201d \u2014 looks set to shine if the Chinese Communist Party allows it.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $3 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 63%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by NEO\u2019s sleepy looking returns in 2020. NEO (formerly known as Antshares) is one of China\u2019s earliest and largest cryptocurrency ventures. The coin fell hard in 2018 as the Chinese government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. But in 2021, the coin staged a remarkable resurgence as Chinese regulators turned their ire to Ant Group, a payments processor.\n\nWith the Chinese Communist Party now rethinking its stance on cryptocurrencies, NEO has a chance to shine once again.\n\nLender Celsius is a cryptocurrency with the potential to become a bank.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2018Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 3,717%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2018, Celsius Network crowdfunded $20 million to create a cryptocurrency lending platform. Since then, the network has written $6.2 billion in loans and produced $11 million in interest income, making it more like a bank than a currency. And by registering as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Celsius has soared even as other regulatory related currencies like XRP have struggled. In fact, its 2020 return was one of the highest of any other coin.\n\nStill, Celsius has plenty of risk for potential investors. As companies from Bear Stearns to Lehman Brothers found, bad loans can quickly threaten the stability of an entire lending operation. And the Celsius Network has raised red flags in the past, particularly with its unclear collateral requirements. In other words, Celsius could also blow up like a bank if they don\u2019t have the right controls in place.\n\nNevertheless, CEL could still continue to rise. It\u2019s one of the largest pure-play P2P lenders in the crypto space, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in 2021.\n\nWant to have your own blockchain?

Others might point to Nano\u2019s reasonably superior technology. But in the microcap altcoin world, timing has far more to do with luck.\n\nHowever, now that demand is rising, keep watch. A short-term spike is often how new coins gain popularity. With its ability to assign entire blockchains to individual accounts, Nano looks like an attractive Bitcoin alternative.\n\nChainlink is a cryptocurrency that allows others to run smart contracts.

Rather than operate its own blockchain, Chainlink runs smart contracts on other blockchains. That makes LINK an anomaly in the cryptocurrency world \u2014 a coin that\u2019s relatively agnostic to whichever blockchain it\u2019s working on. It\u2019s a formula that sounds good in theory.\n\nFrom an investor standpoint, however, Chainlink\u2019s complexity has worked against it. Making use of the protocol still requires hardcore programming knowledge, and that shrinks its potential audience. What Chainlink needs is a strong sponsor \u2014 a business like Ripple Labs, for example \u2014 to market and implement its smart contracts as required.\n\nIf the currency can find that sponsor, LINK will soar. Otherwise, investors can expect the currency to stall in 2021 as newer smart-contract coins take over.\n\nLisk is an early delegated proof-of-stake coin that was bested by competitors.

The delegated proof-of-stake coin initially priced at $8 as excited ICO investors saw LSK as an alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s issues. Built on JavaScript, one of the most common programming languages, Lisk promised to open application developments to a far wider range of developers.\n\nThe optimism, however, didn\u2019t last. As Lisk\u2019s programming issues began to emerge, the coin\u2019s price began to sink \u2014 certain quirks in its programming language made it relatively inefficient and prone to non-deterministic behavior. By 2017, LSK had shed almost all its value to settle at just 10 cents. And despite a second massive run-up in the 2018 cryptocurrency bubble, the coin has since settled back, dropping off the top-100 coin charts by market cap.\n\nInterest in the coin, however, has refused to completely disappear. Earlier this year, Robinhood added Lisk to its list of tracked cryptocurrencies, sending prices up over 250%. That means, while Lisk might have significant technological issues, renewed interest in the coin could incentivize developers back to the drawing board to improve the coin. If that happens (and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d), Lisk could quickly regain strength and challenge the larger coins once again.\n\nMonero is the No. 1 privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $4 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: 4 cents2020 Return: 244%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMonero has long been a favored coin for its privacy applications.

And its community has continued to improve its privacy \u2014 from improving its decoy transactions to obscuring recipient identities.\n\nBut Monero ran into early issues. Because transactions are so private, it quickly became a favorite of Darknet users looking to hide their tracks. After suffering a series of scandals, XMR\u2019s price plummeted in 2017. Yet, the cryptocurrency has had a revival in recent months. Since February, the currency has increased by almost 300% as privacy concerns have taken center stage.\n\nAs we move into 2021, XMR looks like a cryptocurrency with second-wind potential.

These transactions are secured by OMG Network\u2019s coin, OMG.\n\nDespite its relative promise, however, investor interest in the OMG Network has been muted. Like Dai/MakerDAO and other cryptocurrencies that rely on other blockchains, OMG has had trouble raising enough interest to create life of its own. Still, it\u2019s one of the handful of coins Robinhood tracks, making it a potential smaller break-out coin for 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t expect fireworks.

By the second week of February, QTUM had risen 270%.\n\nBut there\u2019s where the similarities begin to end. Unlike Lisk, which is written in the more-commonly used JavaScript, QTUM is written in far faster C. That has allowed its community to develop strong protocols that have kept up with many of Bitcoin\u2019s own modifications.\n\nQTUM remains a niche coin \u2014 as of the beginning of 2021, the cryptocurrency remains outside the top-50 by market cap.

Litecoin\u2019s size also makes it less vulnerable to a \u201c51% attack\u201d than other Bitcoin-like currencies.\n\nMy two-star rating comes down to momentum. Although it was once a popular Bitcoin alternative, Litecoin has since struggled to differentiate itself from its bigger brother.

Put another way, the proverbial $1,000 invested in Ethereum last year would now be worth about $7,000.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Source: Shutterstock\n\n\nIn early February, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) introduced futures contracts in Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, which started in 2015 as a programmable blockchain. Such futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell Ether at a predetermined price at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace\u00a0contributor Vivian Medithi covered the topic earlier this month and highlighted, \u201cAnalysts expect to see increased institutional investment in ether as a result of the introduction of futures contracts, bolstering the recent bullish run in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s move comes about three years after its December 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures. At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon. So as a small allocation to a portfolio, it could be worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

A Shiba Inu-themed cryptocurrency that was the brainchild of two software engineers has taken the investing world by storm. After years of being overshadowed by more popular coins like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) and Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD), Dogecoin got its turn in the spotlight after Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) billionaire boss tweeted \u201cWho let the Doge out.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 29 the currency was up 800%, becoming the \u201ccrypto (GameStop (NYSE:GME) gme\u201d according to one Reddit user. A seemingly unknown coin now has the internet abuzz. If there\u2019s one lesson we can learn from this, it\u2019s that memes and tweets have the power to move markets.\n\nAlthough many may have heard about Dogecoin for the first time in the last couple of weeks, the cryptocurrency has actually been around since 2013. The coin was the product of a joke by two software engineers who wanted to pay homage to Bitcoin\u2019s then-questionable reputation. A coin that meant to garner nothing more than a few laughs has now become the face of the cryptocurrency industry. Its claim to fame is the result of a series of tweets and memes.\n\nFor reasons that still remain unclear, Dogecoin caught the attention of billionaire Elon Musk. Tesla\u2019s tenacious CEO took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to tweet about the coin, writing \u201cno highs, no lows, only Doge\u201d along with a Lion King meme with the Shiba Inu dog on Simba\u2019s face.\n\nNot long after this, Dogecoin\u2019s price skyrocketed, surging more than 800% in 24 hours. Other billionaires and pop culture icons like Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg got in on the action, tweeting about the currency as well.\n\nDogecoin is proof of the radical shift in market power with people participating in the rally for a sense of community. Although the coin has no intrinsic value like stocks or bonds, investors are rallying together to get its value to $1. The Dogecoin phenomenon is a case study in how culture and technology have the ability to literally move markets. Just as we saw in GameStop stock\u2019s meteoric rally last month.\n\nDogecoin has dipped 20% since its Feb. 7 high of 0.087159. Nevertheless, the currency is still up 1,350% this year with a market value of $8 billion. While many have expressed enthusiasm about the currency, others remain cautious.\n\nAn article by MarketWatch explains that unlike traditional Bitcoin which is limited in supply, Dogecoin has no built-in limit. This means that it can be mined for hundreds or thousands at any given time. Ultimately, the currency value is the result of a mass-market movement that remains untethered.\n\nSo the currency, as it stands, is largely speculative. Billy Markus, the founder of Dogecoin, recently stated the rally is \u201cnot something (he) can comprehend.\u201d He likened the rally to that of stocks like GameStop and AMC (NYSE:AMC) \u2014 both of which have cooled down considerably from their highs. Many researchers have also urged investors to exercise greater caution when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin.\n\nThe rise in the currency\u2019s price can serve as a real temptation to investors but its long-term growth remains unsustainable. On one hand, the currency is a great investment alternative in an environment where interest rates are close to zero. But on the flip side, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional investments, Bitcoin is disproportionately controlled with 95% of the currency controlled by just 2% of the market.\n\nThe recent rally in Dogecoin is a testament to the power of memes. While the price spikes are definitely attractive, it\u2019s also worth noting that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. According to Garrick Hileman of blockchain.com, Dogecoin could lose 90% of its value.\n\nWith this being a real possibility (as we saw with GME and AMC stock), I wouldn\u2019t go all-in on Dogecoin. However, if you want to be a part of the mass market movement, Dogecoin does trade on the cheap and is worth a small investment. Even if things don\u2019t go your way, it could serve as a great learning opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya Premkumar has a finance degree from the University of Houston, Texas.

It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run.

The move triggered $280 million in futures contracts liquidations, indicating excessive leverage from longs.\n\nAlthough the initial anxiety regarding CME's ETH futures launch on Feb. 8 seems to have faded, sustained excessive transaction fees might have undermined investors' confidence. Nevertheless, the fundamentals behind Ethereum remain solid, indicating ETH price should promptly recover from eventual dips.\n\nEven though the above metric might be interpreted positively, not every user can afford a $12 fee. A simple token swap on decentralized exchanges (DEX) can cost hundreds of dollars in gas fees, leaving small traders no choice but to abandon the network.\n\nMultiple proponents are testing sharding and layer-two solutions to circumvent this issue, including Skale and Optimistic Network. Eth2 will use sharding to split the blockchain into several parts and increase the number of transactions the network can process at once.\n\nThe phenomenal growth of total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance projects can't be disregarded. The adjusted metric attempts to clean readings from ETH price increases, therefore providing more reliable data.\n\nAs depicted above, the 34% increase over the past 30 days falls in line with ETH's 38% gain in February. Regardless of the transaction fees, there is still value created by automated market-making pools and staking mechanisms.\n\nTo better understand whether the recent crash reflects a potential local top and subsequent downtrend movement, one needs further data. Besides price action and technical analysis, investors should also gauge on-chain metrics such as network use. An excellent place to start is analyzing transactions and transfer value.\n\nCoin Metrics data shows the 14-day average transactions and transfers rallying above $9 billion in daily transactions, a 32% increase from the previous month. This significant increase in transaction and transfer value signals strength and suggests that Ether's price is sustainable at the current levels.\n\nAlthough there is no consensus among analysts on the short-term price impact of exchange withdrawals, its effect is either neutral or bullish. The opposite movement, large continuous inflows, is the only bearish scenario, as it indicates holders' willingness to sell.\n\nFrom Jan. 1 to Feb. 15, roughly 600,000 ETH was withdrawn from exchanges. Regardless of if whales are transferring to cold wallets or putting Ether into the DeFi ecosystem, those coins are less likely to be sold in the short term.\n\nConsidering this movement happened while Ethereum made a $1,870 all-time high, the indicator indicates holders' confidence. \n\nTo conclude, based on both on-chain metrics and trading perspective, there are encouraging signals that $2,000 is within reach and that dips are being bought up aggressively.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general. But you should at least know this reality before stepping forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Based on this trend, the trader said BTC outperforming ETH is not a surprise. He said:\n\nIn the near term, one variable that could catalyze a larger accumulation trend for Ether is the listing of Ethereum futures by CME. As Cointelegraph reported, CME listed Ethereum futures on Feb. 9, the day ETH broke out and achieved a new all-time high.\n\nIt has been less than two weeks since the CME Ethereum futures market launched, and many trading desks and institutions are likely still in the process of preparing their infrastructure. Hence, the actual demand and trading volume for ETH in the CME Ethereum futures market will likely take time to grow, as seen with Bitcoin, until funds begin actively trading the asset.\n\nAt the same time, with the cryptocurrency bull market is in full, major investment funds and retail investors may be experiencing FOMO, according to Paolo Ardoino, the CTO at Bitfinex. He explained:\n\nLastly, one major factor that underpins Bitcoin's \"digital store of value\" proposition is the capped supply of BTC contrary to the unknown total supply of Ether. Therefore, besides the brand image, this digital scarcity aspect is likely what's driving institutions first and foremost to Bitcoin. \n\nMeanwhile, other cryptocurrencies like ETH remain alternatives or \"altcoins\" and are typically considered for the purpose of diversifying, albeit in much smaller amounts if any, as exemplified by Grayscale's holdings.\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Two NYC bars are for sale \u2014 asking price is 25 bitcoin", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/pf.E1D0Bf9xAOkzuMDgcHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/62f05ae0-7302-11eb-bfbf-f3b92472ae90", "auther": "Alexis Christoforous", "body": "A long-time restaurant owner in New York City is looking to sell his two bars for bitcoin. Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter @AlexisTVNews.\n"}]}]
