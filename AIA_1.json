newest Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) upgrade, the network\u2019s largest overhaul since it went live on Ethereum in 2019, a blog post shared with CoinDesk claims. Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Carried Out 'Nerdy' Test of Blockchain Payments in Space, Exec Says\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nasarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei. Gas fees are currently at historic highs with an average transaction surpassing $40 Tuesday, according to Blockchair.\n\nRelated: East Caribbean Central Bank Conducts 'Milestone' Retail Digital Currency Transaction\n\nNot only will the update lessen congestion on Ethereum, but it should decrease call latency, Nazarov said.\n\n\u201cReally what OCR does is take the computation we were doing on-chain and porting it out to an off-chain environment, and that is creating a very large 10x increase in efficiency, which means we can put a lot more data on-chain,\u201d Nazarov said.\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n"}, {"headline": "DeFi Tech, CeFi Speed: dYdX Touts New StarkWare Integration", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 hour ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/MpHfICs7RZt5VjC40w206A--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/10b142a491c7fe36ccc61908814e56c1", "auther": "William Foxley", "body": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) trading venue dYdX is now onboarding users to a new version of its platform built on StarkWare\u2019s Cairo software.\n\nCross-margin perpetuals are now available to early signups at zero gas fees thanks to a proprietary implementation of the layer 2 solution.

The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen said bitcoin was \"inefficient\" as a means of payment and highly speculative.\n\nAnalysts also pointed to tweet from Elon Musk over the weekend saying bitcoin and ethereum prices \"seem high.\"\n\n\"Tesla and bitcoin are increasingly tied together and the latter had a crazy day, trading down -16.53% at one point before closing -4.21% in its worst daily performance this month,\" said Jim Reid, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"It\u2019s not clear if the moves were prompted by a delayed reaction to an Elon Musk tweet on Saturday in which he said that the bitcoin did 'seem high'.\"\n\nThe slump follows a surge over the last few months that has propelled the market to new highs. Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Tesla scores about $1 billion in profits from Bitcoin: Wedbush's Dan Ives", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/DRFv6hd8jl8ukNhrQl4EXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1790a240-37e3-11ea-bd6c-b09fddc3cadb", "auther": "Ines Ferr\u00e9", "body": "Tesla's (TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the electric vehicle company about $1 billion in profits \u2014 at least on paper, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives.\n\n\"That\u2019s more than all they made on EV vehicles in 2020, but that continues to be the double-edge sword. It\u2019s going to add risk to the story, and we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the volatility,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla announced it had invested about $1.5 billion in bitcoin and may accept the cryptocurrency for payment of products in the 'near future.' That day the price of bitcoin shot up to new highs, surging nearly 14%.\n\nDespite the recent price movements in cryptocurrencies, Ives believes Bitcoin is still a \"sideshow\" when it comes to the Tesla story.\n\n\"Most investors I talk to still view the goalposts relatively contained in terms of the assets, and it\u2019s a side show because ultimately the overall story here is the transformational EV story,\" said Ives. \"Right now it\u2019s Tesla\u2018s world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of EVs.\"\n\nIves doesn't see the moves in cryptocurrency as part the overall valuation of the company.\n\n\"I still view Bitcoin as not being factored into the price. If that starts to be 3 to 4 billion [dollars] that they invest or more, then that starts to be something more significant... but right now we think China alone is worth $100 per share.\" said Ives.\n\n\"We still believe although a ripple effect, less than 5% of public companies will be investing in bitcoin over the next 12 to 18 months until at least there are more regulatory goal posts put in,\" said the analyst.\n\nCEO Elon Musk mentions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enough to move prices.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

Once that consolidation ended though, it was off to the races again.\n\nNow pushing through the 161.8% extension, let\u2019s see if Litecoin can push up to $250, then $269.50, as the two-times range extension comes into play near the latter.\n-  7 Stocks Riding the Crypto Craze \n\nOn the downside, I would love to see the 161.8% extension act as support, as well as $200. Below puts this week\u2019s low in play near $186.50.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nLast but not least is Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL). Up almost 17% this week, shares are rallying into earnings scheduled for Monday.\n\nThis one has been on fire, reclaiming its 10-day, 21-day, 50-day and 100-day moving averages amid the four-day rally. It doesn\u2019t look like much after such a wide trading range over the last year, but it\u2019s a nice run. Ahead of earnings does make it a little tricky, though.\n\nOver the 50% retracement and its short-term moving averages puts the bulls in control for the moment. On a bullish earnings reaction, let\u2019s see if shares can clear the recent high near $85. Above puts the 61.8% retracement in play, then the $100 mark.\n\nOn a bearish reaction, see if RCL stock holds the 100-day moving average \u2014 the lowest of the four listed above. Below uptrend support (blue line) and the 38.2% retracement and 200-day moving average are in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  Top Stock Picker Reveals His Next Potential Winner \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

newest Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) upgrade, the network\u2019s largest overhaul since it went live on Ethereum in 2019, a blog post shared with CoinDesk claims. Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Carried Out 'Nerdy' Test of Blockchain Payments in Space, Exec Says\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nasarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei. Gas fees are currently at historic highs with an average transaction surpassing $40 Tuesday, according to Blockchair.\n\nRelated: East Caribbean Central Bank Conducts 'Milestone' Retail Digital Currency Transaction\n\nNot only will the update lessen congestion on Ethereum, but it should decrease call latency, Nazarov said.\n\n\u201cReally what OCR does is take the computation we were doing on-chain and porting it out to an off-chain environment, and that is creating a very large 10x increase in efficiency, which means we can put a lot more data on-chain,\u201d Nazarov said.\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n"}, {"headline": "DeFi Tech, CeFi Speed: dYdX Touts New StarkWare Integration", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 hour ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/MpHfICs7RZt5VjC40w206A--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/10b142a491c7fe36ccc61908814e56c1", "auther": "William Foxley", "body": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) trading venue dYdX is now onboarding users to a new version of its platform built on StarkWare\u2019s Cairo software.\n\nCross-margin perpetuals are now available to early signups at zero gas fees thanks to a proprietary implementation of the layer 2 solution.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions.

It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top.

From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD. And we see 2,342 to be the next target for ETH/USD for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Support Zone with $1775.00 Setting the Tone \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into .7916 \n-  NZD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Strengthens Over .7232, Weakens Under .7206 \n-  Stocks Move Higher Despite Rising Bond Yields \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n"}, {"headline": "Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rallies On After Passing $50K Psychological Level to $52K", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Dczf2PGBO5QrAV0J6CQSkw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/fbeb8a141a000522d9c355ff78ab803c", "auther": "Muyao Shen", "body": "Bitcoin broke above $52,000 Wednesday, with a market capitalization nearing $1 trillion.\n- Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $52,231.69 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).

newest Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) upgrade, the network\u2019s largest overhaul since it went live on Ethereum in 2019, a blog post shared with CoinDesk claims. Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Carried Out 'Nerdy' Test of Blockchain Payments in Space, Exec Says\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nasarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei. Gas fees are currently at historic highs with an average transaction surpassing $40 Tuesday, according to Blockchair.\n\nRelated: East Caribbean Central Bank Conducts 'Milestone' Retail Digital Currency Transaction\n\nNot only will the update lessen congestion on Ethereum, but it should decrease call latency, Nazarov said.\n\n\u201cReally what OCR does is take the computation we were doing on-chain and porting it out to an off-chain environment, and that is creating a very large 10x increase in efficiency, which means we can put a lot more data on-chain,\u201d Nazarov said.\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n- Chainlink Promises \u201910x Data\u2019 With New \u2018Off-Chain Reporting\u2019 Overhaul\n"}, {"headline": "DeFi Tech, CeFi Speed: dYdX Touts New StarkWare Integration", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 hour ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/MpHfICs7RZt5VjC40w206A--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/10b142a491c7fe36ccc61908814e56c1", "auther": "William Foxley", "body": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) trading venue dYdX is now onboarding users to a new version of its platform built on StarkWare\u2019s Cairo software.\n\nCross-margin perpetuals are now available to early signups at zero gas fees thanks to a proprietary implementation of the layer 2 solution.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions.

Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top.

This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC.

From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD. And we see 2,342 to be the next target for ETH/USD for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Support Zone with $1775.00 Setting the Tone \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into .7916 \n-  NZD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Strengthens Over .7232, Weakens Under .7206 \n-  Stocks Move Higher Despite Rising Bond Yields \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n"}, {"headline": "Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rallies On After Passing $50K Psychological Level to $52K", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Dczf2PGBO5QrAV0J6CQSkw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/fbeb8a141a000522d9c355ff78ab803c", "auther": "Muyao Shen", "body": "Bitcoin broke above $52,000 Wednesday, with a market capitalization nearing $1 trillion.\n- Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $52,231.69 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).

Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Carried Out 'Nerdy' Test of Blockchain Payments in Space, Exec Says\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nasarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions.

Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD. And we see 2,342 to be the next target for ETH/USD for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Support Zone with $1775.00 Setting the Tone \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into .7916 \n-  NZD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Strengthens Over .7232, Weakens Under .7206 \n-  Stocks Move Higher Despite Rising Bond Yields \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n"}, {"headline": "Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rallies On After Passing $50K Psychological Level to $52K", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Dczf2PGBO5QrAV0J6CQSkw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/fbeb8a141a000522d9c355ff78ab803c", "auther": "Muyao Shen", "body": "Bitcoin broke above $52,000 Wednesday, with a market capitalization nearing $1 trillion.\n- Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $52,231.69 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).

Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Carried Out 'Nerdy' Test of Blockchain Payments in Space, Exec Says\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nasarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions.

Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD. And we see 2,342 to be the next target for ETH/USD for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Support Zone with $1775.00 Setting the Tone \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into .7916 \n-  NZD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Strengthens Over .7232, Weakens Under .7206 \n-  Stocks Move Higher Despite Rising Bond Yields \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n"}, {"headline": "Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rallies On After Passing $50K Psychological Level to $52K", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Dczf2PGBO5QrAV0J6CQSkw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/fbeb8a141a000522d9c355ff78ab803c", "auther": "Muyao Shen", "body": "Bitcoin broke above $52,000 Wednesday, with a market capitalization nearing $1 trillion.\n- Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $52,231.69 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).

perpetuals are now available to early signups at zero gas fees thanks to a proprietary implementation of the layer 2 solution.

Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Carried Out 'Nerdy' Test of Blockchain Payments in Space, Exec Says\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nasarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions.

Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins?

He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven.

This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC.

From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

The number flipped positive on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cCoinbase [U.S. dollar] whales are like gatekeepers\u201d of the bull market, Ki said of investors with large holdings.\n\nEther (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $1,828.15 and climbing 4.45% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).\n\nOn the technical side, ether is in a consolidation phase after losing short-term momentum, according to Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies.\n\n\u201cI view the consolidation as healthy within the context of its steep uptrend,\u201d Stockton said. \u201cThe 20-day moving average at $1,556 is a gauge of initial support.\u201d\n\nRead more: Coinbase, Readying for Public Listing, Gets $77B Valuation From Nasdaq Private Market\n\nEther\u2019s correlation with bitcoin has been flat this month at around 0.68, after it moved down to as low as 0.55 in January.\n\n\u201cAs long as bitcoin stays above $49,000 we can expect a rally in the altcoins, including ether,\u201d OKEx Insights\u2019 Naseer said. \u201cBut that will only happen when bitcoin\u2019s volatility drops a little.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, institutional interest in ether futures has grown significantly, according to data provided by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\n\u201cOne week after ether futures launched on CME, daily trading volume reached a total of $75.8 million yesterday \u2013 almost doubling Friday\u2019s volume of $40 million,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a tweet Wednesday. \u201cMeanwhile, open interest has increased to $62 million.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the CME\u2019s new ether futures contract last week might be one reason why ether\u2019s price has underperformed, said trader and analyst Alex Kruger.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Favorite Lossless Lottery Will Airdrop Its POOL Token Today\n\n\u201cEther is a high beta asset to bitcoin, and it is supposed to move in line,\u201d Kruger said. \u201cSometimes its own set of technical and or fundamental drivers kick in and make price trajectories or performance differences.\u201d\n\nDigital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in green Wednesday.

It has gained almost 20% this week.\n\nIn December it soared past Visa (V) to make it the world\u2019s largest financial service.\n\nBitcoin has been fuelled of late by acceptance from mainstream investors and companies, such as Tesla (TSLA) and Mastercard (MA).\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla invested $1.5bn in the cryptocurrency, and said it may even start accepting it as payment for its products.\n\nIn a filing with the SEC, Tesla said it has \u201cinvested an aggregate $1.5bn in bitcoin,\u201d and \u201cmay acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term.\u201d\n\nIt added that it expects to \u201cbegin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for [its] products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which [it] may or may not liquidate upon receipt.\u201d\n\nIts popularity has also been boosted by Tesla\u2019s founder Elon Musk, who has often been seen tweeting about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe publicly declared on Thursday that he favours it to fiat currency as global interest rates are currently at record lows, saying Bitcoin is a \u201cless dumb form of liquidity than cash.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be clear, I am not an investor, I am an engineer,\u201d he said on Twitter. \"I don\u2019t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHowever, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn\u2019t look elsewhere.

The rise has coincided with a surge of populism in financial markets around the world.\n\nDogecoin hit a new all-time high this month, as celebrity attention including rapper Snoop Dogg continued to buoy up the price of the joke token.\n\nREAD MORE: Dogecoin hits new high after Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg tweets\n\nThe digital currency, which uses a Shiba Inu dog as its mascot, first started up as a joke in 2013 but has seen its market capitalisation pass $6bn.\n\nMusk first tweeted just the word \u201cDoge,\u201d followed by \u201cDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto,\u201d and \u201cNo highs, no lows, only Doge.\u201d He also posted a Lion King meme of him holding up the dogecoin dog as if it were Simba.\n\nHe said at the time: \"They are really just meant to be jokes, but you know Dogecoin was made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies obviously, but fate loves irony and often as a friend of mine says that the most ironic outcome or I'd say the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of earth in the future.\u201d\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n"}, {"headline": "4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: BA, DE, Litecoin, RCL", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace via Yahoo Finance", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/I_GHyyLeQaHlxgIMX3eotg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investorplace_417/13522e8441308910763ccbb76de3f676", "auther": "Bret Kenwell", "body": "It was an up-and-down session that\u2019s now mostly flat for the S&P 500.

The stock looks like a high-flying tech holding more than an industrial/agriculture company. That said, it does have some tech components to the business model.\n\nRegardless, this stock has been moving straight up for months now.

Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cThe most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Carried Out 'Nerdy' Test of Blockchain Payments in Space, Exec Says\n\nOCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs\u2019 academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.\n\nThe new update \u2013 which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds \u2013 aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\n\u201cThe initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,\u201d Nasarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.\n\nChainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider\u2019s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That\u2019s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions.

Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins?

He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top.

This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC.

Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

The number flipped positive on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cCoinbase [U.S. dollar] whales are like gatekeepers\u201d of the bull market, Ki said of investors with large holdings.\n\nEther (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $1,828.15 and climbing 4.45% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).\n\nOn the technical side, ether is in a consolidation phase after losing short-term momentum, according to Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies.\n\n\u201cI view the consolidation as healthy within the context of its steep uptrend,\u201d Stockton said. \u201cThe 20-day moving average at $1,556 is a gauge of initial support.\u201d\n\nRead more: Coinbase, Readying for Public Listing, Gets $77B Valuation From Nasdaq Private Market\n\nEther\u2019s correlation with bitcoin has been flat this month at around 0.68, after it moved down to as low as 0.55 in January.\n\n\u201cAs long as bitcoin stays above $49,000 we can expect a rally in the altcoins, including ether,\u201d OKEx Insights\u2019 Naseer said. \u201cBut that will only happen when bitcoin\u2019s volatility drops a little.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, institutional interest in ether futures has grown significantly, according to data provided by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\n\u201cOne week after ether futures launched on CME, daily trading volume reached a total of $75.8 million yesterday \u2013 almost doubling Friday\u2019s volume of $40 million,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a tweet Wednesday. \u201cMeanwhile, open interest has increased to $62 million.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the CME\u2019s new ether futures contract last week might be one reason why ether\u2019s price has underperformed, said trader and analyst Alex Kruger.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Favorite Lossless Lottery Will Airdrop Its POOL Token Today\n\n\u201cEther is a high beta asset to bitcoin, and it is supposed to move in line,\u201d Kruger said. \u201cSometimes its own set of technical and or fundamental drivers kick in and make price trajectories or performance differences.\u201d\n\nDigital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in green Wednesday.

The rise has coincided with a surge of populism in financial markets around the world.\n\nDogecoin hit a new all-time high this month, as celebrity attention including rapper Snoop Dogg continued to buoy up the price of the joke token.\n\nREAD MORE: Dogecoin hits new high after Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg tweets\n\nThe digital currency, which uses a Shiba Inu dog as its mascot, first started up as a joke in 2013 but has seen its market capitalisation pass $6bn.\n\nMusk first tweeted just the word \u201cDoge,\u201d followed by \u201cDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto,\u201d and \u201cNo highs, no lows, only Doge.\u201d He also posted a Lion King meme of him holding up the dogecoin dog as if it were Simba.\n\nHe said at the time: \"They are really just meant to be jokes, but you know Dogecoin was made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies obviously, but fate loves irony and often as a friend of mine says that the most ironic outcome or I'd say the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of earth in the future.\u201d\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n"}, {"headline": "4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: BA, DE, Litecoin, RCL", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace via Yahoo Finance", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/I_GHyyLeQaHlxgIMX3eotg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investorplace_417/13522e8441308910763ccbb76de3f676", "auther": "Bret Kenwell", "body": "It was an up-and-down session that\u2019s now mostly flat for the S&P 500.

The stock looks like a high-flying tech holding more than an industrial/agriculture company. That said, it does have some tech components to the business model.\n\nRegardless, this stock has been moving straight up for months now.
