The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen said bitcoin was \"inefficient\" as a means of payment and highly speculative.\n\nAnalysts also pointed to tweet from Elon Musk over the weekend saying bitcoin and ethereum prices \"seem high.\"\n\n\"Tesla and bitcoin are increasingly tied together and the latter had a crazy day, trading down -16.53% at one point before closing -4.21% in its worst daily performance this month,\" said Jim Reid, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"It\u2019s not clear if the moves were prompted by a delayed reaction to an Elon Musk tweet on Saturday in which he said that the bitcoin did 'seem high'.\"\n\nThe slump follows a surge over the last few months that has propelled the market to new highs. Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Tesla scores about $1 billion in profits from Bitcoin: Wedbush's Dan Ives", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "23 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/DRFv6hd8jl8ukNhrQl4EXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1790a240-37e3-11ea-bd6c-b09fddc3cadb", "auther": "Ines Ferr\u00e9", "body": "Tesla's (TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the electric vehicle company about $1 billion in profits \u2014 at least on paper, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives.\n\n\"That\u2019s more than all they made on EV vehicles in 2020, but that continues to be the double-edge sword.

Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD. And we see 2,342 to be the next target for ETH/USD for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Support Zone with $1775.00 Setting the Tone \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into .7916 \n-  NZD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Strengthens Over .7232, Weakens Under .7206 \n-  Stocks Move Higher Despite Rising Bond Yields \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n"}, {"headline": "Valid Points: How CME Ether Futures Work and Why They Matter", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Wq00tZtkHE.2hxhjF86mLA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/8fa5189d0a92dc9194382bb6e8e158e3", "auther": "Christine Kim and William Foxley", "body": "Trading in ether futures went live on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) late last Sunday with the February contract registering an opening price of $1,669.75.\u00a0\n\nIn less than two weeks, the open price of the February contract has jumped 5% to $1747.75 as ether spot prices have continued to climb upwards of $1,700.\n\nIn terms of weekly trading volume, CME ether futures contracts surpassed $160 million in its first full week of trading.\u00a0\n\nRelated: How to Bring Off-Chain Assets to DeFi\n\nAccording to Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, the initial activity of the CME\u2019s market for ether futures is promising but there\u2019s still a long way to go before the product is fully established and mature enough to support other derivatives products such as options.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a really good job the first few days but obviously we want to see more in terms of on-screen liquidity. Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

Now at the three-times range extension and new record highs though, and I\u2019m in no hurry to chase this one either.\n\nAbove $335, and a run to $350 is possible, then $380. A break of the 10-week moving average will eventually happen, putting the 21-week moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nTuesday was Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). Wednesday was Bitcoin Cash (CCC:BCH-USD). Thursday was Etherium (CCC:ETH-USD). Now let\u2019s look at Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) as we wrap up the crypto week and as bitcoin hits a $1 trillion market capitalization today.\n\nLitecoin had a pretty rough correction from its 2019 high at $146.95 down to its 2020 low at $24.85. However, it\u2019s been on fire over the last few months.\n\nShares ripped up through the prior 2019 high, then consolidated its gains by finding support at the 10-week moving average. Once that consolidation ended though, it was off to the races again.\n\nNow pushing through the 161.8% extension, let\u2019s see if Litecoin can push up to $250, then $269.50, as the two-times range extension comes into play near the latter.\n-  7 Stocks Riding the Crypto Craze \n\nOn the downside, I would love to see the 161.8% extension act as support, as well as $200. Below puts this week\u2019s low in play near $186.50.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nLast but not least is Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL). Up almost 17% this week, shares are rallying into earnings scheduled for Monday.\n\nThis one has been on fire, reclaiming its 10-day, 21-day, 50-day and 100-day moving averages amid the four-day rally. It doesn\u2019t look like much after such a wide trading range over the last year, but it\u2019s a nice run. Ahead of earnings does make it a little tricky, though.\n\nOver the 50% retracement and its short-term moving averages puts the bulls in control for the moment. On a bullish earnings reaction, let\u2019s see if shares can clear the recent high near $85. Above puts the 61.8% retracement in play, then the $100 mark.\n\nOn a bearish reaction, see if RCL stock holds the 100-day moving average \u2014 the lowest of the four listed above. Below uptrend support (blue line) and the 38.2% retracement and 200-day moving average are in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  Top Stock Picker Reveals His Next Potential Winner \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

Why stick your neck out if you don't have to? I have my reasons for doing so this time around, so let's get into it. The SEC should move approval of a crypto ETF framework to the top of their agenda.\n\nLet me cut to the point. Then I'll tell you why I actually think this is important for folks who still read text longer than 280 characters. Here are my five arguments:\n\n1: The SEC's job is not, as is often claimed, to \"protect retail investors.\" You won't find that phrase in the '33 or '34 Acts (to my knowledge, but I'm sure some bigger nerd will counter). Instead, the heart of those two establishing acts (and most subsequent regulation) ensures that the markets work as fairly as possible. Sure, retail investors are included under the umbrella of 'investors,' but it's the system, not any specific individual, that the SEC is designed to regulate and protect. After all, it was established in response to widespread lack of faith in the capital markets following the Great Depression. The Commission is at the core about providing transparency & standardization -- making sure that all the market participants from swap dealers to Microsoft tell the truth and make sure transactions of capital flow through the economy in a standardized and verifiable way.\n\n2: The current state of access to crypto for U.S. investors is bonkers. Sure, there's an ecosystem of semi-regulated crypto exchanges. Sure, the IRS has given a little guidance so that crypto owners, traders, and investors can feel confident they won't end up Al Capone'd. But inaction by the SEC has forced the ecosystem to develop around them rather than with them. That's why we now have things like GBTC and BITW -- trusts that exist solely to trade on the least-regulated securities markets in the country, charge (sorry guys) way too much, and trade at ludicrous premia. These approaches are broken by design -- a design essentially forced by the SEC's unwilling hand.\n\n3: Like clockwork, the Ontario Securities Commission is showing us the way. Having beaten the U.S. to the punch on pretty much every significant ETF innovation (from mutual funds, to ETFs, to options-based ETFs, to non-transparent active, to rattle a few off the top of my head). The Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX: BTCC) launched this week and shot out of the gate without a hiccup. I say this not in some jingoistic 'America First' sense, but simply to point out that the OSC framework allows non-traditional assets to get wrapped up in ETFs with certain frameworks and guidelines. In other words, they created a transparent and standardized way to deal with new stuff. (It's called National Instrument 81-102). So now we have a $200 million (it will be by the time you read this) Bitcoin ETF trading just across the border.\n\n4: We actually have clear pathways to make this happen. Recent filings (and countless responses both public and private) from VanEck or Bitwise or Valkyrie have acquiesced or responded well to essentially every objection the SEC has made, whether it's been pricing sources or the lack of mainstream custody, or the impact of 'non-economic' traders. The markets have matured to the point where we have insured exchanges like Coinbase, and Bitcoin is already flowing through the balance sheets of dozens of companies and backdoor Bitcoin trading vehicles.\n\n5: Last but not least: the demand is obviously there. Bitcoin market cap is knocking on $1 Trillion. The crypto market cap will be $2 Trillion within a few months at current trends. Daily trading volumes dwarf many commodities and countless stocks. Pretending this doesn't exist isn't going to be helpful for anyone.\n\nI'm happy to wade through minutiae with readers, but the reality is that it's pretty straightforward. We know how to take a security like Bitcoin and stick it in a vault. We've been trading GLD since 2004. I want to be super clear here though: I'm still an enormous Bitcoin skeptic. I'm also a gold skeptic. Both are fundamentally psychological commodities. They have value because a group has decided they have value. That's fine: lots of things are psychological commodities, from art to collectible cars.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is the stalking horse for a much more interesting set of technologies. If you've been living in a cave (I'm a regular cave-dweller), the hot new thing in the Crypto world is decentralized finance, or 'DeFi.' This is just a catchy phrase for something a bunch of market nerds started talking about in the wake the global financial crisis: solving the last big inefficiencies of the market by using Blockchain.\n\nI will admit to being an absolute tourist here, but I've watched with real interest as DeFi has caught on. The phenomenon is actually unrelated to Bitcoin. Instead, most DeFi projects aren't a 'thing' in the sense that \"Bitcoin is a store of value.\" They're processes, ways of making other things happen. And most DeFi applications rely on the specific quirks of Ethereum and its copycats. Ethereum blends the value exchange mechanisms of cryptocurrencies (decentralized ledgers, transactions, community-based security, etc.) with the best parts of object-oriented programming and cloud computing. To really 'get it' requires a few leaps of faith, or at least it did for me. Nerdy readers like me should wade in deep, set up a private development environment, and write up some dummy 'hello world' style applications (here's where I started).\n\nEventually, I realized that smart-contracts with embedded value and computational power solve a ton of problems. Most importantly, they eliminate clearing and settlement in any traditional sense. Projects like Uniswap (or FTX, which is relatively locked down for Americans) are already replacing traditional exchange mechanisms for trading between crypto-assets. In FTX's case (U.S. Investors Need Not Apply), they've invented a system for taking stock ownership into the blockchain but nominating swap pairs of essentially any risk folks want to back (TSLA anyone?).\n\nIt's all unrelentingly cool.\n\nI'm not here to explain Uniswap and FTX, and DeFi. Smarter people are writing more exhaustive guides. But what I want to do is go back to something I mentioned two weeks ago in the chaos of the GameStop thing.\n\nIn a capitalist society, value is created or destroyed primarily in the national economy. You buy a share of stock for $100. A bunch of people decide they also like it, and it goes to $200. That $100 gain is 'trapped' on the national side of the economic barrier until you sell it and have spendable USD. That's why embedded gains 'feel' less real than cash in your bank account or coins in your pocket. They can disappear instantly should (for some exogenous reason) the very next price assigned to your stock be zero.\n\nOne of the reasons Bitcoin is so unsatisfying is because it's just so boring. All it does is store capital in the crypto-notional economy. Literally.\n\nEthereum (and its kin) is different. Uniswap, for example, needs Ethereum to work. It needs the actual tokens - the ETH itself - to do anything. So if I create a Uniswap token that allowed me to (purely hypothetically, of course) trade World of Warcraft in-game currency for airline flight miles, I need Ethereum but have no use for the U.S. Dollar. These things still have utility - the game currency allows me to participate in an activity I enjoy, the flight miles let me go on vacation. They still have notional value. They can swing wildly in relationship to each other based on supply and demand.\n\nThis is good. This is exciting. This solves real problems. It's enormously efficient. But there are real issues under the hood of how you make large-scale transactions work in this kind of environment. Folks like Uniswap and FTX have answers (like liquidity backstops and clever pooling mechanisms). But the missing link is out of their control. Which brings us to...\n\nThe Notional Barriers\n\nAs it stands, all of the intermediation between where the interesting stuff is happening (crypto) and the rest of the economy has to go through hard currency of some sort. You want to trade your shares of stock for Dogecoin, and you're going to have to go through cash and probably through a different set of accounts. It's an enormous drag on capital flow. That's why we have whole products like futures and swaps which allow you to move money around in the notional securitized economy without round-tripping through cash unless you want to.\n\nApproving a Bitcoin ETF in a vacuum -- while making a certain group of investors very happy -- isn't all that important. What is important is having a hand on the tiller for how capitalism itself evolves. What the SEC has is an opportunity to help drive the future of markets. I would argue that all of the next 20 years' interesting problems in securities markets have to do with crossing the barriers between these two notional economies and then between those economies and the real economy.\n\nWhy does crossing this notional boundary help? Quite literally, any transaction that currently involves exchanging dollars for any kind of capital asset could be made far more frictionless. House closings could take seconds with the right smart contract system. Rebalancing from stocks to bonds could become tax-less (without guidance) capital swaps. Moving any amount of capital from bucket A to bucket B could be -- with vision -- instantaneous and nearly free. That's what's at stake here: how the entire system works.\n\nAnd how do you start breaking and crossing these barriers? Step one is creating the framework for exchanging capital from the crypto notional economy and the securitized-notional economy. This is another way of saying in-kind exchange between the two, without having to buy and sell through cash. And that's just another way of describing an ETF. Remember ETFs? That's where this started. An ETF is just a vehicle for wrapping exposures in exchange tradable packages after all!) That's why we need a U.S.-listed and regulated Bitcoin ETF that uses a completely standard in-kind creation/redemption mechanism (unlike the Canadian Purpose Bitcoin ETF, which still relies on cash creations to get new Bitcoin into the trust). Bitcoin In, ETF shares out. ETF Shares in, Bitcoin Out. It's a first step in rethinking how capital moves.\n\nThe SEC (and, if we're honest, the U.S. Treasury) has a chance to lead here by working with the crypto community to create a viable framework for technologies and securities that helps smooth capital flow across these barriers.\n\nOr we can just wait for the Ontario Securities Commission to figure it out for us. They'll send us the schematics in a few years.\n\n(Obligatory caveats: I'm just one old nerd trying to keep up. If I missed something, I'm sure you'll let me know on Twitter @DaveNadig. Also, at the time of this being published, I own zero crypto assets. I have traded quite a few in the past month as a learning exercise, and I'm not promising I won't buy any in the future, but I ain't talking my book here).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM

The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Tesla scores about $1 billion in profits from Bitcoin: Wedbush's Dan Ives", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "23 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/DRFv6hd8jl8ukNhrQl4EXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1790a240-37e3-11ea-bd6c-b09fddc3cadb", "auther": "Ines Ferr\u00e9", "body": "Tesla's (TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the electric vehicle company about $1 billion in profits \u2014 at least on paper, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives.\n\n\"That\u2019s more than all they made on EV vehicles in 2020, but that continues to be the double-edge sword.

Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD. And we see 2,342 to be the next target for ETH/USD for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Support Zone with $1775.00 Setting the Tone \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into .7916 \n-  NZD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Strengthens Over .7232, Weakens Under .7206 \n-  Stocks Move Higher Despite Rising Bond Yields \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n"}, {"headline": "Valid Points: How CME Ether Futures Work and Why They Matter", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Wq00tZtkHE.2hxhjF86mLA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/8fa5189d0a92dc9194382bb6e8e158e3", "auther": "Christine Kim and William Foxley", "body": "Trading in ether futures went live on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) late last Sunday with the February contract registering an opening price of $1,669.75.\u00a0\n\nIn less than two weeks, the open price of the February contract has jumped 5% to $1747.75 as ether spot prices have continued to climb upwards of $1,700.\n\nIn terms of weekly trading volume, CME ether futures contracts surpassed $160 million in its first full week of trading.\u00a0\n\nRelated: How to Bring Off-Chain Assets to DeFi\n\nAccording to Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, the initial activity of the CME\u2019s market for ether futures is promising but there\u2019s still a long way to go before the product is fully established and mature enough to support other derivatives products such as options.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a really good job the first few days but obviously we want to see more in terms of on-screen liquidity. Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

Moving nicely on Friday, bulls will be looking for Boeing to give us a two-times weekly-up rotation by clearing the highs from the prior two weeks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf it can do that, as well as hurdle the 50% retracement, the $234 level could be in play, followed by the December high near $244. Above that puts the 61.8% retracement on the table near $250.\n-  7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don\u2019t Get Tired Of \n\nOn the downside, a break of the 10-week moving average puts the 21-week moving average on deck, followed by the $188 to $190 area.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nMan, what else can we say about Deere (NYSE:DE) at this point? The stock looks like a high-flying tech holding more than an industrial/agriculture company. That said, it does have some tech components to the business model.\n\nRegardless, this stock has been moving straight up for months now. Each dip to the 10-week moving average \u2014 including this week \u2014 has been bought aggressively by the bulls.\n\nThe institutional support is robust with this one, which would have me crossing it off my \u201cshort list\u201d in a hurry. Now at the three-times range extension and new record highs though, and I\u2019m in no hurry to chase this one either.\n\nAbove $335, and a run to $350 is possible, then $380. A break of the 10-week moving average will eventually happen, putting the 21-week moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nTuesday was Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). Wednesday was Bitcoin Cash (CCC:BCH-USD). Thursday was Etherium (CCC:ETH-USD). Now let\u2019s look at Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) as we wrap up the crypto week and as bitcoin hits a $1 trillion market capitalization today.\n\nLitecoin had a pretty rough correction from its 2019 high at $146.95 down to its 2020 low at $24.85. However, it\u2019s been on fire over the last few months.\n\nShares ripped up through the prior 2019 high, then consolidated its gains by finding support at the 10-week moving average. Once that consolidation ended though, it was off to the races again.\n\nNow pushing through the 161.8% extension, let\u2019s see if Litecoin can push up to $250, then $269.50, as the two-times range extension comes into play near the latter.\n-  7 Stocks Riding the Crypto Craze \n\nOn the downside, I would love to see the 161.8% extension act as support, as well as $200. Below puts this week\u2019s low in play near $186.50.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nLast but not least is Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL). Up almost 17% this week, shares are rallying into earnings scheduled for Monday.\n\nThis one has been on fire, reclaiming its 10-day, 21-day, 50-day and 100-day moving averages amid the four-day rally. It doesn\u2019t look like much after such a wide trading range over the last year, but it\u2019s a nice run. Ahead of earnings does make it a little tricky, though.\n\nOver the 50% retracement and its short-term moving averages puts the bulls in control for the moment. On a bullish earnings reaction, let\u2019s see if shares can clear the recent high near $85. Above puts the 61.8% retracement in play, then the $100 mark.\n\nOn a bearish reaction, see if RCL stock holds the 100-day moving average \u2014 the lowest of the four listed above. Below uptrend support (blue line) and the 38.2% retracement and 200-day moving average are in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  Top Stock Picker Reveals His Next Potential Winner \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

Why stick your neck out if you don't have to? I have my reasons for doing so this time around, so let's get into it. The SEC should move approval of a crypto ETF framework to the top of their agenda.\n\nLet me cut to the point. Then I'll tell you why I actually think this is important for folks who still read text longer than 280 characters. Here are my five arguments:\n\n1: The SEC's job is not, as is often claimed, to \"protect retail investors.\" You won't find that phrase in the '33 or '34 Acts (to my knowledge, but I'm sure some bigger nerd will counter). Instead, the heart of those two establishing acts (and most subsequent regulation) ensures that the markets work as fairly as possible. Sure, retail investors are included under the umbrella of 'investors,' but it's the system, not any specific individual, that the SEC is designed to regulate and protect. After all, it was established in response to widespread lack of faith in the capital markets following the Great Depression. The Commission is at the core about providing transparency & standardization -- making sure that all the market participants from swap dealers to Microsoft tell the truth and make sure transactions of capital flow through the economy in a standardized and verifiable way.\n\n2: The current state of access to crypto for U.S. investors is bonkers. Sure, there's an ecosystem of semi-regulated crypto exchanges. Sure, the IRS has given a little guidance so that crypto owners, traders, and investors can feel confident they won't end up Al Capone'd. But inaction by the SEC has forced the ecosystem to develop around them rather than with them. That's why we now have things like GBTC and BITW -- trusts that exist solely to trade on the least-regulated securities markets in the country, charge (sorry guys) way too much, and trade at ludicrous premia. These approaches are broken by design -- a design essentially forced by the SEC's unwilling hand.\n\n3: Like clockwork, the Ontario Securities Commission is showing us the way. Having beaten the U.S. to the punch on pretty much every significant ETF innovation (from mutual funds, to ETFs, to options-based ETFs, to non-transparent active, to rattle a few off the top of my head). The Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX: BTCC) launched this week and shot out of the gate without a hiccup. I say this not in some jingoistic 'America First' sense, but simply to point out that the OSC framework allows non-traditional assets to get wrapped up in ETFs with certain frameworks and guidelines. In other words, they created a transparent and standardized way to deal with new stuff. (It's called National Instrument 81-102). So now we have a $200 million (it will be by the time you read this) Bitcoin ETF trading just across the border.\n\n4: We actually have clear pathways to make this happen. Recent filings (and countless responses both public and private) from VanEck or Bitwise or Valkyrie have acquiesced or responded well to essentially every objection the SEC has made, whether it's been pricing sources or the lack of mainstream custody, or the impact of 'non-economic' traders. The markets have matured to the point where we have insured exchanges like Coinbase, and Bitcoin is already flowing through the balance sheets of dozens of companies and backdoor Bitcoin trading vehicles.\n\n5: Last but not least: the demand is obviously there. Bitcoin market cap is knocking on $1 Trillion. The crypto market cap will be $2 Trillion within a few months at current trends. Daily trading volumes dwarf many commodities and countless stocks. Pretending this doesn't exist isn't going to be helpful for anyone.\n\nI'm happy to wade through minutiae with readers, but the reality is that it's pretty straightforward. We know how to take a security like Bitcoin and stick it in a vault. We've been trading GLD since 2004. I want to be super clear here though: I'm still an enormous Bitcoin skeptic. I'm also a gold skeptic. Both are fundamentally psychological commodities. They have value because a group has decided they have value. That's fine: lots of things are psychological commodities, from art to collectible cars.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is the stalking horse for a much more interesting set of technologies. If you've been living in a cave (I'm a regular cave-dweller), the hot new thing in the Crypto world is decentralized finance, or 'DeFi.' This is just a catchy phrase for something a bunch of market nerds started talking about in the wake the global financial crisis: solving the last big inefficiencies of the market by using Blockchain.\n\nI will admit to being an absolute tourist here, but I've watched with real interest as DeFi has caught on. The phenomenon is actually unrelated to Bitcoin. Instead, most DeFi projects aren't a 'thing' in the sense that \"Bitcoin is a store of value.\" They're processes, ways of making other things happen. And most DeFi applications rely on the specific quirks of Ethereum and its copycats. Ethereum blends the value exchange mechanisms of cryptocurrencies (decentralized ledgers, transactions, community-based security, etc.) with the best parts of object-oriented programming and cloud computing. To really 'get it' requires a few leaps of faith, or at least it did for me. Nerdy readers like me should wade in deep, set up a private development environment, and write up some dummy 'hello world' style applications (here's where I started).\n\nEventually, I realized that smart-contracts with embedded value and computational power solve a ton of problems. Most importantly, they eliminate clearing and settlement in any traditional sense. Projects like Uniswap (or FTX, which is relatively locked down for Americans) are already replacing traditional exchange mechanisms for trading between crypto-assets. In FTX's case (U.S. Investors Need Not Apply), they've invented a system for taking stock ownership into the blockchain but nominating swap pairs of essentially any risk folks want to back (TSLA anyone?).\n\nIt's all unrelentingly cool.\n\nI'm not here to explain Uniswap and FTX, and DeFi. Smarter people are writing more exhaustive guides. But what I want to do is go back to something I mentioned two weeks ago in the chaos of the GameStop thing.\n\nIn a capitalist society, value is created or destroyed primarily in the national economy. You buy a share of stock for $100. A bunch of people decide they also like it, and it goes to $200. That $100 gain is 'trapped' on the national side of the economic barrier until you sell it and have spendable USD. That's why embedded gains 'feel' less real than cash in your bank account or coins in your pocket. They can disappear instantly should (for some exogenous reason) the very next price assigned to your stock be zero.\n\nOne of the reasons Bitcoin is so unsatisfying is because it's just so boring. All it does is store capital in the crypto-notional economy. Literally.\n\nEthereum (and its kin) is different. Uniswap, for example, needs Ethereum to work. It needs the actual tokens - the ETH itself - to do anything. So if I create a Uniswap token that allowed me to (purely hypothetically, of course) trade World of Warcraft in-game currency for airline flight miles, I need Ethereum but have no use for the U.S. Dollar. These things still have utility - the game currency allows me to participate in an activity I enjoy, the flight miles let me go on vacation. They still have notional value. They can swing wildly in relationship to each other based on supply and demand.\n\nThis is good. This is exciting. This solves real problems. It's enormously efficient. But there are real issues under the hood of how you make large-scale transactions work in this kind of environment. Folks like Uniswap and FTX have answers (like liquidity backstops and clever pooling mechanisms). But the missing link is out of their control. Which brings us to...\n\nThe Notional Barriers\n\nAs it stands, all of the intermediation between where the interesting stuff is happening (crypto) and the rest of the economy has to go through hard currency of some sort. You want to trade your shares of stock for Dogecoin, and you're going to have to go through cash and probably through a different set of accounts. It's an enormous drag on capital flow. That's why we have whole products like futures and swaps which allow you to move money around in the notional securitized economy without round-tripping through cash unless you want to.\n\nApproving a Bitcoin ETF in a vacuum -- while making a certain group of investors very happy -- isn't all that important. What is important is having a hand on the tiller for how capitalism itself evolves. What the SEC has is an opportunity to help drive the future of markets. I would argue that all of the next 20 years' interesting problems in securities markets have to do with crossing the barriers between these two notional economies and then between those economies and the real economy.\n\nWhy does crossing this notional boundary help? Quite literally, any transaction that currently involves exchanging dollars for any kind of capital asset could be made far more frictionless. House closings could take seconds with the right smart contract system. Rebalancing from stocks to bonds could become tax-less (without guidance) capital swaps. Moving any amount of capital from bucket A to bucket B could be -- with vision -- instantaneous and nearly free. That's what's at stake here: how the entire system works.\n\nAnd how do you start breaking and crossing these barriers? Step one is creating the framework for exchanging capital from the crypto notional economy and the securitized-notional economy. This is another way of saying in-kind exchange between the two, without having to buy and sell through cash. And that's just another way of describing an ETF. Remember ETFs? That's where this started. An ETF is just a vehicle for wrapping exposures in exchange tradable packages after all!) That's why we need a U.S.-listed and regulated Bitcoin ETF that uses a completely standard in-kind creation/redemption mechanism (unlike the Canadian Purpose Bitcoin ETF, which still relies on cash creations to get new Bitcoin into the trust). Bitcoin In, ETF shares out. ETF Shares in, Bitcoin Out. It's a first step in rethinking how capital moves.\n\nThe SEC (and, if we're honest, the U.S. Treasury) has a chance to lead here by working with the crypto community to create a viable framework for technologies and securities that helps smooth capital flow across these barriers.\n\nOr we can just wait for the Ontario Securities Commission to figure it out for us. They'll send us the schematics in a few years.\n\n(Obligatory caveats: I'm just one old nerd trying to keep up. If I missed something, I'm sure you'll let me know on Twitter @DaveNadig. Also, at the time of this being published, I own zero crypto assets. I have traded quite a few in the past month as a learning exercise, and I'm not promising I won't buy any in the future, but I ain't talking my book here).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions.

Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

Why stick your neck out if you don't have to? I have my reasons for doing so this time around, so let's get into it. The SEC should move approval of a crypto ETF framework to the top of their agenda.\n\nLet me cut to the point. Then I'll tell you why I actually think this is important for folks who still read text longer than 280 characters. Here are my five arguments:\n\n1: The SEC's job is not, as is often claimed, to \"protect retail investors.\" You won't find that phrase in the '33 or '34 Acts (to my knowledge, but I'm sure some bigger nerd will counter). Instead, the heart of those two establishing acts (and most subsequent regulation) ensures that the markets work as fairly as possible. Sure, retail investors are included under the umbrella of 'investors,' but it's the system, not any specific individual, that the SEC is designed to regulate and protect. After all, it was established in response to widespread lack of faith in the capital markets following the Great Depression. The Commission is at the core about providing transparency & standardization -- making sure that all the market participants from swap dealers to Microsoft tell the truth and make sure transactions of capital flow through the economy in a standardized and verifiable way.\n\n2: The current state of access to crypto for U.S. investors is bonkers. Sure, there's an ecosystem of semi-regulated crypto exchanges. Sure, the IRS has given a little guidance so that crypto owners, traders, and investors can feel confident they won't end up Al Capone'd. But inaction by the SEC has forced the ecosystem to develop around them rather than with them. That's why we now have things like GBTC and BITW -- trusts that exist solely to trade on the least-regulated securities markets in the country, charge (sorry guys) way too much, and trade at ludicrous premia. These approaches are broken by design -- a design essentially forced by the SEC's unwilling hand.\n\n3: Like clockwork, the Ontario Securities Commission is showing us the way. Having beaten the U.S. to the punch on pretty much every significant ETF innovation (from mutual funds, to ETFs, to options-based ETFs, to non-transparent active, to rattle a few off the top of my head). The Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX: BTCC) launched this week and shot out of the gate without a hiccup. I say this not in some jingoistic 'America First' sense, but simply to point out that the OSC framework allows non-traditional assets to get wrapped up in ETFs with certain frameworks and guidelines. In other words, they created a transparent and standardized way to deal with new stuff. (It's called National Instrument 81-102). So now we have a $200 million (it will be by the time you read this) Bitcoin ETF trading just across the border.\n\n4: We actually have clear pathways to make this happen. Recent filings (and countless responses both public and private) from VanEck or Bitwise or Valkyrie have acquiesced or responded well to essentially every objection the SEC has made, whether it's been pricing sources or the lack of mainstream custody, or the impact of 'non-economic' traders. The markets have matured to the point where we have insured exchanges like Coinbase, and Bitcoin is already flowing through the balance sheets of dozens of companies and backdoor Bitcoin trading vehicles.\n\n5: Last but not least: the demand is obviously there. Bitcoin market cap is knocking on $1 Trillion. The crypto market cap will be $2 Trillion within a few months at current trends. Daily trading volumes dwarf many commodities and countless stocks. Pretending this doesn't exist isn't going to be helpful for anyone.\n\nI'm happy to wade through minutiae with readers, but the reality is that it's pretty straightforward. We know how to take a security like Bitcoin and stick it in a vault. We've been trading GLD since 2004. I want to be super clear here though: I'm still an enormous Bitcoin skeptic. I'm also a gold skeptic. Both are fundamentally psychological commodities. They have value because a group has decided they have value. That's fine: lots of things are psychological commodities, from art to collectible cars.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is the stalking horse for a much more interesting set of technologies. If you've been living in a cave (I'm a regular cave-dweller), the hot new thing in the Crypto world is decentralized finance, or 'DeFi.' This is just a catchy phrase for something a bunch of market nerds started talking about in the wake the global financial crisis: solving the last big inefficiencies of the market by using Blockchain.\n\nI will admit to being an absolute tourist here, but I've watched with real interest as DeFi has caught on. The phenomenon is actually unrelated to Bitcoin. Instead, most DeFi projects aren't a 'thing' in the sense that \"Bitcoin is a store of value.\" They're processes, ways of making other things happen. And most DeFi applications rely on the specific quirks of Ethereum and its copycats. Ethereum blends the value exchange mechanisms of cryptocurrencies (decentralized ledgers, transactions, community-based security, etc.) with the best parts of object-oriented programming and cloud computing. To really 'get it' requires a few leaps of faith, or at least it did for me. Nerdy readers like me should wade in deep, set up a private development environment, and write up some dummy 'hello world' style applications (here's where I started).\n\nEventually, I realized that smart-contracts with embedded value and computational power solve a ton of problems. Most importantly, they eliminate clearing and settlement in any traditional sense. Projects like Uniswap (or FTX, which is relatively locked down for Americans) are already replacing traditional exchange mechanisms for trading between crypto-assets. In FTX's case (U.S. Investors Need Not Apply), they've invented a system for taking stock ownership into the blockchain but nominating swap pairs of essentially any risk folks want to back (TSLA anyone?).\n\nIt's all unrelentingly cool.\n\nI'm not here to explain Uniswap and FTX, and DeFi. Smarter people are writing more exhaustive guides. But what I want to do is go back to something I mentioned two weeks ago in the chaos of the GameStop thing.\n\nIn a capitalist society, value is created or destroyed primarily in the national economy. You buy a share of stock for $100. A bunch of people decide they also like it, and it goes to $200. That $100 gain is 'trapped' on the national side of the economic barrier until you sell it and have spendable USD. That's why embedded gains 'feel' less real than cash in your bank account or coins in your pocket. They can disappear instantly should (for some exogenous reason) the very next price assigned to your stock be zero.\n\nOne of the reasons Bitcoin is so unsatisfying is because it's just so boring. All it does is store capital in the crypto-notional economy. Literally.\n\nEthereum (and its kin) is different. Uniswap, for example, needs Ethereum to work. It needs the actual tokens - the ETH itself - to do anything. So if I create a Uniswap token that allowed me to (purely hypothetically, of course) trade World of Warcraft in-game currency for airline flight miles, I need Ethereum but have no use for the U.S. Dollar. These things still have utility - the game currency allows me to participate in an activity I enjoy, the flight miles let me go on vacation. They still have notional value. They can swing wildly in relationship to each other based on supply and demand.\n\nThis is good. This is exciting. This solves real problems. It's enormously efficient. But there are real issues under the hood of how you make large-scale transactions work in this kind of environment. Folks like Uniswap and FTX have answers (like liquidity backstops and clever pooling mechanisms). But the missing link is out of their control. Which brings us to...\n\nThe Notional Barriers\n\nAs it stands, all of the intermediation between where the interesting stuff is happening (crypto) and the rest of the economy has to go through hard currency of some sort. You want to trade your shares of stock for Dogecoin, and you're going to have to go through cash and probably through a different set of accounts. It's an enormous drag on capital flow. That's why we have whole products like futures and swaps which allow you to move money around in the notional securitized economy without round-tripping through cash unless you want to.\n\nApproving a Bitcoin ETF in a vacuum -- while making a certain group of investors very happy -- isn't all that important. What is important is having a hand on the tiller for how capitalism itself evolves. What the SEC has is an opportunity to help drive the future of markets. I would argue that all of the next 20 years' interesting problems in securities markets have to do with crossing the barriers between these two notional economies and then between those economies and the real economy.\n\nWhy does crossing this notional boundary help? Quite literally, any transaction that currently involves exchanging dollars for any kind of capital asset could be made far more frictionless. House closings could take seconds with the right smart contract system. Rebalancing from stocks to bonds could become tax-less (without guidance) capital swaps. Moving any amount of capital from bucket A to bucket B could be -- with vision -- instantaneous and nearly free. That's what's at stake here: how the entire system works.\n\nAnd how do you start breaking and crossing these barriers? Step one is creating the framework for exchanging capital from the crypto notional economy and the securitized-notional economy. This is another way of saying in-kind exchange between the two, without having to buy and sell through cash. And that's just another way of describing an ETF. Remember ETFs? That's where this started. An ETF is just a vehicle for wrapping exposures in exchange tradable packages after all!) That's why we need a U.S.-listed and regulated Bitcoin ETF that uses a completely standard in-kind creation/redemption mechanism (unlike the Canadian Purpose Bitcoin ETF, which still relies on cash creations to get new Bitcoin into the trust). Bitcoin In, ETF shares out. ETF Shares in, Bitcoin Out. It's a first step in rethinking how capital moves.\n\nThe SEC (and, if we're honest, the U.S. Treasury) has a chance to lead here by working with the crypto community to create a viable framework for technologies and securities that helps smooth capital flow across these barriers.\n\nOr we can just wait for the Ontario Securities Commission to figure it out for us. They'll send us the schematics in a few years.\n\n(Obligatory caveats: I'm just one old nerd trying to keep up. If I missed something, I'm sure you'll let me know on Twitter @DaveNadig. Also, at the time of this being published, I own zero crypto assets. I have traded quite a few in the past month as a learning exercise, and I'm not promising I won't buy any in the future, but I ain't talking my book here).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM

The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Tesla scores about $1 billion in profits from Bitcoin: Wedbush's Dan Ives", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "23 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/DRFv6hd8jl8ukNhrQl4EXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1790a240-37e3-11ea-bd6c-b09fddc3cadb", "auther": "Ines Ferr\u00e9", "body": "Tesla's (TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the electric vehicle company about $1 billion in profits \u2014 at least on paper, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives.\n\n\"That\u2019s more than all they made on EV vehicles in 2020, but that continues to be the double-edge sword.

I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD. And we see 2,342 to be the next target for ETH/USD for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Support Zone with $1775.00 Setting the Tone \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into .7916 \n-  NZD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Strengthens Over .7232, Weakens Under .7206 \n-  Stocks Move Higher Despite Rising Bond Yields \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n"}, {"headline": "Valid Points: How CME Ether Futures Work and Why They Matter", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Wq00tZtkHE.2hxhjF86mLA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/8fa5189d0a92dc9194382bb6e8e158e3", "auther": "Christine Kim and William Foxley", "body": "Trading in ether futures went live on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) late last Sunday with the February contract registering an opening price of $1,669.75.\u00a0\n\nIn less than two weeks, the open price of the February contract has jumped 5% to $1747.75 as ether spot prices have continued to climb upwards of $1,700.\n\nIn terms of weekly trading volume, CME ether futures contracts surpassed $160 million in its first full week of trading.\u00a0\n\nRelated: How to Bring Off-Chain Assets to DeFi\n\nAccording to Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, the initial activity of the CME\u2019s market for ether futures is promising but there\u2019s still a long way to go before the product is fully established and mature enough to support other derivatives products such as options.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a really good job the first few days but obviously we want to see more in terms of on-screen liquidity. Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

Moving nicely on Friday, bulls will be looking for Boeing to give us a two-times weekly-up rotation by clearing the highs from the prior two weeks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf it can do that, as well as hurdle the 50% retracement, the $234 level could be in play, followed by the December high near $244. Above that puts the 61.8% retracement on the table near $250.\n-  7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don\u2019t Get Tired Of \n\nOn the downside, a break of the 10-week moving average puts the 21-week moving average on deck, followed by the $188 to $190 area.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nMan, what else can we say about Deere (NYSE:DE) at this point? The stock looks like a high-flying tech holding more than an industrial/agriculture company. That said, it does have some tech components to the business model.\n\nRegardless, this stock has been moving straight up for months now. Each dip to the 10-week moving average \u2014 including this week \u2014 has been bought aggressively by the bulls.\n\nThe institutional support is robust with this one, which would have me crossing it off my \u201cshort list\u201d in a hurry. Now at the three-times range extension and new record highs though, and I\u2019m in no hurry to chase this one either.\n\nAbove $335, and a run to $350 is possible, then $380. A break of the 10-week moving average will eventually happen, putting the 21-week moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nTuesday was Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). Wednesday was Bitcoin Cash (CCC:BCH-USD). Thursday was Etherium (CCC:ETH-USD). Now let\u2019s look at Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) as we wrap up the crypto week and as bitcoin hits a $1 trillion market capitalization today.\n\nLitecoin had a pretty rough correction from its 2019 high at $146.95 down to its 2020 low at $24.85. However, it\u2019s been on fire over the last few months.\n\nShares ripped up through the prior 2019 high, then consolidated its gains by finding support at the 10-week moving average. Once that consolidation ended though, it was off to the races again.\n\nNow pushing through the 161.8% extension, let\u2019s see if Litecoin can push up to $250, then $269.50, as the two-times range extension comes into play near the latter.\n-  7 Stocks Riding the Crypto Craze \n\nOn the downside, I would love to see the 161.8% extension act as support, as well as $200. Below puts this week\u2019s low in play near $186.50.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nLast but not least is Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL). Up almost 17% this week, shares are rallying into earnings scheduled for Monday.\n\nThis one has been on fire, reclaiming its 10-day, 21-day, 50-day and 100-day moving averages amid the four-day rally. It doesn\u2019t look like much after such a wide trading range over the last year, but it\u2019s a nice run. Ahead of earnings does make it a little tricky, though.\n\nOver the 50% retracement and its short-term moving averages puts the bulls in control for the moment. On a bullish earnings reaction, let\u2019s see if shares can clear the recent high near $85. Above puts the 61.8% retracement in play, then the $100 mark.\n\nOn a bearish reaction, see if RCL stock holds the 100-day moving average \u2014 the lowest of the four listed above. Below uptrend support (blue line) and the 38.2% retracement and 200-day moving average are in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.\n-  Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG \n-  Top Stock Picker Reveals His Next Potential Winner \n-  It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

Why stick your neck out if you don't have to? I have my reasons for doing so this time around, so let's get into it. The SEC should move approval of a crypto ETF framework to the top of their agenda.\n\nLet me cut to the point. Then I'll tell you why I actually think this is important for folks who still read text longer than 280 characters. Here are my five arguments:\n\n1: The SEC's job is not, as is often claimed, to \"protect retail investors.\" You won't find that phrase in the '33 or '34 Acts (to my knowledge, but I'm sure some bigger nerd will counter). Instead, the heart of those two establishing acts (and most subsequent regulation) ensures that the markets work as fairly as possible. Sure, retail investors are included under the umbrella of 'investors,' but it's the system, not any specific individual, that the SEC is designed to regulate and protect. After all, it was established in response to widespread lack of faith in the capital markets following the Great Depression. The Commission is at the core about providing transparency & standardization -- making sure that all the market participants from swap dealers to Microsoft tell the truth and make sure transactions of capital flow through the economy in a standardized and verifiable way.\n\n2: The current state of access to crypto for U.S. investors is bonkers. Sure, there's an ecosystem of semi-regulated crypto exchanges. Sure, the IRS has given a little guidance so that crypto owners, traders, and investors can feel confident they won't end up Al Capone'd. But inaction by the SEC has forced the ecosystem to develop around them rather than with them. That's why we now have things like GBTC and BITW -- trusts that exist solely to trade on the least-regulated securities markets in the country, charge (sorry guys) way too much, and trade at ludicrous premia. These approaches are broken by design -- a design essentially forced by the SEC's unwilling hand.\n\n3: Like clockwork, the Ontario Securities Commission is showing us the way. Having beaten the U.S. to the punch on pretty much every significant ETF innovation (from mutual funds, to ETFs, to options-based ETFs, to non-transparent active, to rattle a few off the top of my head). The Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX: BTCC) launched this week and shot out of the gate without a hiccup. I say this not in some jingoistic 'America First' sense, but simply to point out that the OSC framework allows non-traditional assets to get wrapped up in ETFs with certain frameworks and guidelines. In other words, they created a transparent and standardized way to deal with new stuff. (It's called National Instrument 81-102). So now we have a $200 million (it will be by the time you read this) Bitcoin ETF trading just across the border.\n\n4: We actually have clear pathways to make this happen. Recent filings (and countless responses both public and private) from VanEck or Bitwise or Valkyrie have acquiesced or responded well to essentially every objection the SEC has made, whether it's been pricing sources or the lack of mainstream custody, or the impact of 'non-economic' traders. The markets have matured to the point where we have insured exchanges like Coinbase, and Bitcoin is already flowing through the balance sheets of dozens of companies and backdoor Bitcoin trading vehicles.\n\n5: Last but not least: the demand is obviously there. Bitcoin market cap is knocking on $1 Trillion. The crypto market cap will be $2 Trillion within a few months at current trends. Daily trading volumes dwarf many commodities and countless stocks. Pretending this doesn't exist isn't going to be helpful for anyone.\n\nI'm happy to wade through minutiae with readers, but the reality is that it's pretty straightforward. We know how to take a security like Bitcoin and stick it in a vault. We've been trading GLD since 2004. I want to be super clear here though: I'm still an enormous Bitcoin skeptic. I'm also a gold skeptic. Both are fundamentally psychological commodities. They have value because a group has decided they have value. That's fine: lots of things are psychological commodities, from art to collectible cars.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is the stalking horse for a much more interesting set of technologies. If you've been living in a cave (I'm a regular cave-dweller), the hot new thing in the Crypto world is decentralized finance, or 'DeFi.' This is just a catchy phrase for something a bunch of market nerds started talking about in the wake the global financial crisis: solving the last big inefficiencies of the market by using Blockchain.\n\nI will admit to being an absolute tourist here, but I've watched with real interest as DeFi has caught on. The phenomenon is actually unrelated to Bitcoin. Instead, most DeFi projects aren't a 'thing' in the sense that \"Bitcoin is a store of value.\" They're processes, ways of making other things happen. And most DeFi applications rely on the specific quirks of Ethereum and its copycats. Ethereum blends the value exchange mechanisms of cryptocurrencies (decentralized ledgers, transactions, community-based security, etc.) with the best parts of object-oriented programming and cloud computing. To really 'get it' requires a few leaps of faith, or at least it did for me. Nerdy readers like me should wade in deep, set up a private development environment, and write up some dummy 'hello world' style applications (here's where I started).\n\nEventually, I realized that smart-contracts with embedded value and computational power solve a ton of problems. Most importantly, they eliminate clearing and settlement in any traditional sense. Projects like Uniswap (or FTX, which is relatively locked down for Americans) are already replacing traditional exchange mechanisms for trading between crypto-assets. In FTX's case (U.S. Investors Need Not Apply), they've invented a system for taking stock ownership into the blockchain but nominating swap pairs of essentially any risk folks want to back (TSLA anyone?).\n\nIt's all unrelentingly cool.\n\nI'm not here to explain Uniswap and FTX, and DeFi. Smarter people are writing more exhaustive guides. But what I want to do is go back to something I mentioned two weeks ago in the chaos of the GameStop thing.\n\nIn a capitalist society, value is created or destroyed primarily in the national economy. You buy a share of stock for $100. A bunch of people decide they also like it, and it goes to $200. That $100 gain is 'trapped' on the national side of the economic barrier until you sell it and have spendable USD. That's why embedded gains 'feel' less real than cash in your bank account or coins in your pocket. They can disappear instantly should (for some exogenous reason) the very next price assigned to your stock be zero.\n\nOne of the reasons Bitcoin is so unsatisfying is because it's just so boring. All it does is store capital in the crypto-notional economy. Literally.\n\nEthereum (and its kin) is different. Uniswap, for example, needs Ethereum to work. It needs the actual tokens - the ETH itself - to do anything. So if I create a Uniswap token that allowed me to (purely hypothetically, of course) trade World of Warcraft in-game currency for airline flight miles, I need Ethereum but have no use for the U.S. Dollar. These things still have utility - the game currency allows me to participate in an activity I enjoy, the flight miles let me go on vacation. They still have notional value. They can swing wildly in relationship to each other based on supply and demand.\n\nThis is good. This is exciting. This solves real problems. It's enormously efficient. But there are real issues under the hood of how you make large-scale transactions work in this kind of environment. Folks like Uniswap and FTX have answers (like liquidity backstops and clever pooling mechanisms). But the missing link is out of their control. Which brings us to...\n\nThe Notional Barriers\n\nAs it stands, all of the intermediation between where the interesting stuff is happening (crypto) and the rest of the economy has to go through hard currency of some sort. You want to trade your shares of stock for Dogecoin, and you're going to have to go through cash and probably through a different set of accounts. It's an enormous drag on capital flow. That's why we have whole products like futures and swaps which allow you to move money around in the notional securitized economy without round-tripping through cash unless you want to.\n\nApproving a Bitcoin ETF in a vacuum -- while making a certain group of investors very happy -- isn't all that important. What is important is having a hand on the tiller for how capitalism itself evolves. What the SEC has is an opportunity to help drive the future of markets. I would argue that all of the next 20 years' interesting problems in securities markets have to do with crossing the barriers between these two notional economies and then between those economies and the real economy.\n\nWhy does crossing this notional boundary help? Quite literally, any transaction that currently involves exchanging dollars for any kind of capital asset could be made far more frictionless. House closings could take seconds with the right smart contract system. Rebalancing from stocks to bonds could become tax-less (without guidance) capital swaps. Moving any amount of capital from bucket A to bucket B could be -- with vision -- instantaneous and nearly free. That's what's at stake here: how the entire system works.\n\nAnd how do you start breaking and crossing these barriers? Step one is creating the framework for exchanging capital from the crypto notional economy and the securitized-notional economy. This is another way of saying in-kind exchange between the two, without having to buy and sell through cash. And that's just another way of describing an ETF. Remember ETFs? That's where this started. An ETF is just a vehicle for wrapping exposures in exchange tradable packages after all!) That's why we need a U.S.-listed and regulated Bitcoin ETF that uses a completely standard in-kind creation/redemption mechanism (unlike the Canadian Purpose Bitcoin ETF, which still relies on cash creations to get new Bitcoin into the trust). Bitcoin In, ETF shares out. ETF Shares in, Bitcoin Out. It's a first step in rethinking how capital moves.\n\nThe SEC (and, if we're honest, the U.S. Treasury) has a chance to lead here by working with the crypto community to create a viable framework for technologies and securities that helps smooth capital flow across these barriers.\n\nOr we can just wait for the Ontario Securities Commission to figure it out for us. They'll send us the schematics in a few years.\n\n(Obligatory caveats: I'm just one old nerd trying to keep up. If I missed something, I'm sure you'll let me know on Twitter @DaveNadig. Also, at the time of this being published, I own zero crypto assets. I have traded quite a few in the past month as a learning exercise, and I'm not promising I won't buy any in the future, but I ain't talking my book here).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

Why stick your neck out if you don't have to? I have my reasons for doing so this time around, so let's get into it. The SEC should move approval of a crypto ETF framework to the top of their agenda.\n\nLet me cut to the point. Then I'll tell you why I actually think this is important for folks who still read text longer than 280 characters. Here are my five arguments:\n\n1: The SEC's job is not, as is often claimed, to \"protect retail investors.\" You won't find that phrase in the '33 or '34 Acts (to my knowledge, but I'm sure some bigger nerd will counter). Instead, the heart of those two establishing acts (and most subsequent regulation) ensures that the markets work as fairly as possible. Sure, retail investors are included under the umbrella of 'investors,' but it's the system, not any specific individual, that the SEC is designed to regulate and protect. After all, it was established in response to widespread lack of faith in the capital markets following the Great Depression. The Commission is at the core about providing transparency & standardization -- making sure that all the market participants from swap dealers to Microsoft tell the truth and make sure transactions of capital flow through the economy in a standardized and verifiable way.\n\n2: The current state of access to crypto for U.S. investors is bonkers. Sure, there's an ecosystem of semi-regulated crypto exchanges. Sure, the IRS has given a little guidance so that crypto owners, traders, and investors can feel confident they won't end up Al Capone'd. But inaction by the SEC has forced the ecosystem to develop around them rather than with them. That's why we now have things like GBTC and BITW -- trusts that exist solely to trade on the least-regulated securities markets in the country, charge (sorry guys) way too much, and trade at ludicrous premia. These approaches are broken by design -- a design essentially forced by the SEC's unwilling hand.\n\n3: Like clockwork, the Ontario Securities Commission is showing us the way. Having beaten the U.S. to the punch on pretty much every significant ETF innovation (from mutual funds, to ETFs, to options-based ETFs, to non-transparent active, to rattle a few off the top of my head). The Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX: BTCC) launched this week and shot out of the gate without a hiccup. I say this not in some jingoistic 'America First' sense, but simply to point out that the OSC framework allows non-traditional assets to get wrapped up in ETFs with certain frameworks and guidelines. In other words, they created a transparent and standardized way to deal with new stuff. (It's called National Instrument 81-102). So now we have a $200 million (it will be by the time you read this) Bitcoin ETF trading just across the border.\n\n4: We actually have clear pathways to make this happen. Recent filings (and countless responses both public and private) from VanEck or Bitwise or Valkyrie have acquiesced or responded well to essentially every objection the SEC has made, whether it's been pricing sources or the lack of mainstream custody, or the impact of 'non-economic' traders. The markets have matured to the point where we have insured exchanges like Coinbase, and Bitcoin is already flowing through the balance sheets of dozens of companies and backdoor Bitcoin trading vehicles.\n\n5: Last but not least: the demand is obviously there. Bitcoin market cap is knocking on $1 Trillion. The crypto market cap will be $2 Trillion within a few months at current trends. Daily trading volumes dwarf many commodities and countless stocks. Pretending this doesn't exist isn't going to be helpful for anyone.\n\nI'm happy to wade through minutiae with readers, but the reality is that it's pretty straightforward. We know how to take a security like Bitcoin and stick it in a vault. We've been trading GLD since 2004. I want to be super clear here though: I'm still an enormous Bitcoin skeptic. I'm also a gold skeptic. Both are fundamentally psychological commodities. They have value because a group has decided they have value. That's fine: lots of things are psychological commodities, from art to collectible cars.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is the stalking horse for a much more interesting set of technologies. If you've been living in a cave (I'm a regular cave-dweller), the hot new thing in the Crypto world is decentralized finance, or 'DeFi.' This is just a catchy phrase for something a bunch of market nerds started talking about in the wake the global financial crisis: solving the last big inefficiencies of the market by using Blockchain.\n\nI will admit to being an absolute tourist here, but I've watched with real interest as DeFi has caught on. The phenomenon is actually unrelated to Bitcoin. Instead, most DeFi projects aren't a 'thing' in the sense that \"Bitcoin is a store of value.\" They're processes, ways of making other things happen. And most DeFi applications rely on the specific quirks of Ethereum and its copycats. Ethereum blends the value exchange mechanisms of cryptocurrencies (decentralized ledgers, transactions, community-based security, etc.) with the best parts of object-oriented programming and cloud computing. To really 'get it' requires a few leaps of faith, or at least it did for me. Nerdy readers like me should wade in deep, set up a private development environment, and write up some dummy 'hello world' style applications (here's where I started).\n\nEventually, I realized that smart-contracts with embedded value and computational power solve a ton of problems. Most importantly, they eliminate clearing and settlement in any traditional sense. Projects like Uniswap (or FTX, which is relatively locked down for Americans) are already replacing traditional exchange mechanisms for trading between crypto-assets. In FTX's case (U.S. Investors Need Not Apply), they've invented a system for taking stock ownership into the blockchain but nominating swap pairs of essentially any risk folks want to back (TSLA anyone?).\n\nIt's all unrelentingly cool.\n\nI'm not here to explain Uniswap and FTX, and DeFi. Smarter people are writing more exhaustive guides. But what I want to do is go back to something I mentioned two weeks ago in the chaos of the GameStop thing.\n\nIn a capitalist society, value is created or destroyed primarily in the national economy. You buy a share of stock for $100. A bunch of people decide they also like it, and it goes to $200. That $100 gain is 'trapped' on the national side of the economic barrier until you sell it and have spendable USD. That's why embedded gains 'feel' less real than cash in your bank account or coins in your pocket. They can disappear instantly should (for some exogenous reason) the very next price assigned to your stock be zero.\n\nOne of the reasons Bitcoin is so unsatisfying is because it's just so boring. All it does is store capital in the crypto-notional economy. Literally.\n\nEthereum (and its kin) is different. Uniswap, for example, needs Ethereum to work. It needs the actual tokens - the ETH itself - to do anything. So if I create a Uniswap token that allowed me to (purely hypothetically, of course) trade World of Warcraft in-game currency for airline flight miles, I need Ethereum but have no use for the U.S. Dollar. These things still have utility - the game currency allows me to participate in an activity I enjoy, the flight miles let me go on vacation. They still have notional value. They can swing wildly in relationship to each other based on supply and demand.\n\nThis is good. This is exciting. This solves real problems. It's enormously efficient. But there are real issues under the hood of how you make large-scale transactions work in this kind of environment. Folks like Uniswap and FTX have answers (like liquidity backstops and clever pooling mechanisms). But the missing link is out of their control. Which brings us to...\n\nThe Notional Barriers\n\nAs it stands, all of the intermediation between where the interesting stuff is happening (crypto) and the rest of the economy has to go through hard currency of some sort. You want to trade your shares of stock for Dogecoin, and you're going to have to go through cash and probably through a different set of accounts. It's an enormous drag on capital flow. That's why we have whole products like futures and swaps which allow you to move money around in the notional securitized economy without round-tripping through cash unless you want to.\n\nApproving a Bitcoin ETF in a vacuum -- while making a certain group of investors very happy -- isn't all that important. What is important is having a hand on the tiller for how capitalism itself evolves. What the SEC has is an opportunity to help drive the future of markets. I would argue that all of the next 20 years' interesting problems in securities markets have to do with crossing the barriers between these two notional economies and then between those economies and the real economy.\n\nWhy does crossing this notional boundary help? Quite literally, any transaction that currently involves exchanging dollars for any kind of capital asset could be made far more frictionless. House closings could take seconds with the right smart contract system. Rebalancing from stocks to bonds could become tax-less (without guidance) capital swaps. Moving any amount of capital from bucket A to bucket B could be -- with vision -- instantaneous and nearly free. That's what's at stake here: how the entire system works.\n\nAnd how do you start breaking and crossing these barriers? Step one is creating the framework for exchanging capital from the crypto notional economy and the securitized-notional economy. This is another way of saying in-kind exchange between the two, without having to buy and sell through cash. And that's just another way of describing an ETF. Remember ETFs? That's where this started. An ETF is just a vehicle for wrapping exposures in exchange tradable packages after all!) That's why we need a U.S.-listed and regulated Bitcoin ETF that uses a completely standard in-kind creation/redemption mechanism (unlike the Canadian Purpose Bitcoin ETF, which still relies on cash creations to get new Bitcoin into the trust). Bitcoin In, ETF shares out. ETF Shares in, Bitcoin Out. It's a first step in rethinking how capital moves.\n\nThe SEC (and, if we're honest, the U.S. Treasury) has a chance to lead here by working with the crypto community to create a viable framework for technologies and securities that helps smooth capital flow across these barriers.\n\nOr we can just wait for the Ontario Securities Commission to figure it out for us. They'll send us the schematics in a few years.\n\n(Obligatory caveats: I'm just one old nerd trying to keep up. If I missed something, I'm sure you'll let me know on Twitter @DaveNadig. Also, at the time of this being published, I own zero crypto assets. I have traded quite a few in the past month as a learning exercise, and I'm not promising I won't buy any in the future, but I ain't talking my book here).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions.

Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price.

Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD.

Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

Why stick your neck out if you don't have to? I have my reasons for doing so this time around, so let's get into it. The SEC should move approval of a crypto ETF framework to the top of their agenda.\n\nLet me cut to the point. Then I'll tell you why I actually think this is important for folks who still read text longer than 280 characters. Here are my five arguments:\n\n1: The SEC's job is not, as is often claimed, to \"protect retail investors.\" You won't find that phrase in the '33 or '34 Acts (to my knowledge, but I'm sure some bigger nerd will counter). Instead, the heart of those two establishing acts (and most subsequent regulation) ensures that the markets work as fairly as possible. Sure, retail investors are included under the umbrella of 'investors,' but it's the system, not any specific individual, that the SEC is designed to regulate and protect. After all, it was established in response to widespread lack of faith in the capital markets following the Great Depression. The Commission is at the core about providing transparency & standardization -- making sure that all the market participants from swap dealers to Microsoft tell the truth and make sure transactions of capital flow through the economy in a standardized and verifiable way.\n\n2: The current state of access to crypto for U.S. investors is bonkers. Sure, there's an ecosystem of semi-regulated crypto exchanges. Sure, the IRS has given a little guidance so that crypto owners, traders, and investors can feel confident they won't end up Al Capone'd. But inaction by the SEC has forced the ecosystem to develop around them rather than with them. That's why we now have things like GBTC and BITW -- trusts that exist solely to trade on the least-regulated securities markets in the country, charge (sorry guys) way too much, and trade at ludicrous premia. These approaches are broken by design -- a design essentially forced by the SEC's unwilling hand.\n\n3: Like clockwork, the Ontario Securities Commission is showing us the way. Having beaten the U.S. to the punch on pretty much every significant ETF innovation (from mutual funds, to ETFs, to options-based ETFs, to non-transparent active, to rattle a few off the top of my head). The Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX: BTCC) launched this week and shot out of the gate without a hiccup. I say this not in some jingoistic 'America First' sense, but simply to point out that the OSC framework allows non-traditional assets to get wrapped up in ETFs with certain frameworks and guidelines. In other words, they created a transparent and standardized way to deal with new stuff. (It's called National Instrument 81-102). So now we have a $200 million (it will be by the time you read this) Bitcoin ETF trading just across the border.\n\n4: We actually have clear pathways to make this happen. Recent filings (and countless responses both public and private) from VanEck or Bitwise or Valkyrie have acquiesced or responded well to essentially every objection the SEC has made, whether it's been pricing sources or the lack of mainstream custody, or the impact of 'non-economic' traders. The markets have matured to the point where we have insured exchanges like Coinbase, and Bitcoin is already flowing through the balance sheets of dozens of companies and backdoor Bitcoin trading vehicles.\n\n5: Last but not least: the demand is obviously there. Bitcoin market cap is knocking on $1 Trillion. The crypto market cap will be $2 Trillion within a few months at current trends. Daily trading volumes dwarf many commodities and countless stocks. Pretending this doesn't exist isn't going to be helpful for anyone.\n\nI'm happy to wade through minutiae with readers, but the reality is that it's pretty straightforward. We know how to take a security like Bitcoin and stick it in a vault. We've been trading GLD since 2004. I want to be super clear here though: I'm still an enormous Bitcoin skeptic. I'm also a gold skeptic. Both are fundamentally psychological commodities. They have value because a group has decided they have value. That's fine: lots of things are psychological commodities, from art to collectible cars.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is the stalking horse for a much more interesting set of technologies. If you've been living in a cave (I'm a regular cave-dweller), the hot new thing in the Crypto world is decentralized finance, or 'DeFi.' This is just a catchy phrase for something a bunch of market nerds started talking about in the wake the global financial crisis: solving the last big inefficiencies of the market by using Blockchain.\n\nI will admit to being an absolute tourist here, but I've watched with real interest as DeFi has caught on. The phenomenon is actually unrelated to Bitcoin. Instead, most DeFi projects aren't a 'thing' in the sense that \"Bitcoin is a store of value.\" They're processes, ways of making other things happen. And most DeFi applications rely on the specific quirks of Ethereum and its copycats. Ethereum blends the value exchange mechanisms of cryptocurrencies (decentralized ledgers, transactions, community-based security, etc.) with the best parts of object-oriented programming and cloud computing. To really 'get it' requires a few leaps of faith, or at least it did for me. Nerdy readers like me should wade in deep, set up a private development environment, and write up some dummy 'hello world' style applications (here's where I started).\n\nEventually, I realized that smart-contracts with embedded value and computational power solve a ton of problems. Most importantly, they eliminate clearing and settlement in any traditional sense. Projects like Uniswap (or FTX, which is relatively locked down for Americans) are already replacing traditional exchange mechanisms for trading between crypto-assets. In FTX's case (U.S. Investors Need Not Apply), they've invented a system for taking stock ownership into the blockchain but nominating swap pairs of essentially any risk folks want to back (TSLA anyone?).\n\nIt's all unrelentingly cool.\n\nI'm not here to explain Uniswap and FTX, and DeFi. Smarter people are writing more exhaustive guides. But what I want to do is go back to something I mentioned two weeks ago in the chaos of the GameStop thing.\n\nIn a capitalist society, value is created or destroyed primarily in the national economy. You buy a share of stock for $100. A bunch of people decide they also like it, and it goes to $200. That $100 gain is 'trapped' on the national side of the economic barrier until you sell it and have spendable USD. That's why embedded gains 'feel' less real than cash in your bank account or coins in your pocket. They can disappear instantly should (for some exogenous reason) the very next price assigned to your stock be zero.\n\nOne of the reasons Bitcoin is so unsatisfying is because it's just so boring. All it does is store capital in the crypto-notional economy. Literally.\n\nEthereum (and its kin) is different. Uniswap, for example, needs Ethereum to work. It needs the actual tokens - the ETH itself - to do anything. So if I create a Uniswap token that allowed me to (purely hypothetically, of course) trade World of Warcraft in-game currency for airline flight miles, I need Ethereum but have no use for the U.S. Dollar. These things still have utility - the game currency allows me to participate in an activity I enjoy, the flight miles let me go on vacation. They still have notional value. They can swing wildly in relationship to each other based on supply and demand.\n\nThis is good. This is exciting. This solves real problems. It's enormously efficient. But there are real issues under the hood of how you make large-scale transactions work in this kind of environment. Folks like Uniswap and FTX have answers (like liquidity backstops and clever pooling mechanisms). But the missing link is out of their control. Which brings us to...\n\nThe Notional Barriers\n\nAs it stands, all of the intermediation between where the interesting stuff is happening (crypto) and the rest of the economy has to go through hard currency of some sort. You want to trade your shares of stock for Dogecoin, and you're going to have to go through cash and probably through a different set of accounts. It's an enormous drag on capital flow. That's why we have whole products like futures and swaps which allow you to move money around in the notional securitized economy without round-tripping through cash unless you want to.\n\nApproving a Bitcoin ETF in a vacuum -- while making a certain group of investors very happy -- isn't all that important. What is important is having a hand on the tiller for how capitalism itself evolves. What the SEC has is an opportunity to help drive the future of markets. I would argue that all of the next 20 years' interesting problems in securities markets have to do with crossing the barriers between these two notional economies and then between those economies and the real economy.\n\nWhy does crossing this notional boundary help? Quite literally, any transaction that currently involves exchanging dollars for any kind of capital asset could be made far more frictionless. House closings could take seconds with the right smart contract system. Rebalancing from stocks to bonds could become tax-less (without guidance) capital swaps. Moving any amount of capital from bucket A to bucket B could be -- with vision -- instantaneous and nearly free. That's what's at stake here: how the entire system works.\n\nAnd how do you start breaking and crossing these barriers? Step one is creating the framework for exchanging capital from the crypto notional economy and the securitized-notional economy. This is another way of saying in-kind exchange between the two, without having to buy and sell through cash. And that's just another way of describing an ETF. Remember ETFs? That's where this started. An ETF is just a vehicle for wrapping exposures in exchange tradable packages after all!) That's why we need a U.S.-listed and regulated Bitcoin ETF that uses a completely standard in-kind creation/redemption mechanism (unlike the Canadian Purpose Bitcoin ETF, which still relies on cash creations to get new Bitcoin into the trust). Bitcoin In, ETF shares out. ETF Shares in, Bitcoin Out. It's a first step in rethinking how capital moves.\n\nThe SEC (and, if we're honest, the U.S. Treasury) has a chance to lead here by working with the crypto community to create a viable framework for technologies and securities that helps smooth capital flow across these barriers.\n\nOr we can just wait for the Ontario Securities Commission to figure it out for us. They'll send us the schematics in a few years.\n\n(Obligatory caveats: I'm just one old nerd trying to keep up. If I missed something, I'm sure you'll let me know on Twitter @DaveNadig. Also, at the time of this being published, I own zero crypto assets. I have traded quite a few in the past month as a learning exercise, and I'm not promising I won't buy any in the future, but I ain't talking my book here).\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM

The slump was led by bitcoin, which accounts for 60% of the cryptocurrency market by value. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 12.5% to $48,876.16 by 8.15am Tuesday in London.\n\nMost major cryptocurrencies were down on the day. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest crypto, was down 14.8% to $1,600.96. Doge Coin (DOGE-USD), a meme crypto that gained popularity in recent weeks thanks to Elon Musk, was down 10% to $0.0508.\n\nREAD MORE: Hedge fund billionaire backs bitcoin payment startup\n\nThe sell-off began on Monday, seemingly triggered by comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

Bitcoin has risen over 400% since the start of October and recently reached a new all-time record above $58,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was propelled higher by increased interest from both retail investors and institutions. Musk's Tesla (TSLA) said earlier this month it had invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, which spiked the asset's price.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Retail suckers' with FOMO will eventually get crushed on Bitcoin, says Roubini\n\n\"For bitcoin, this is certainly not the first major pullback during this cycle, nor is it even the most severe,\" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. \"We're up about 80% year-to-date, and even a normal bull market retracement from the peak right now would take us all the way back to $40,000 per coin.\n\n\"With the powerful narrative that bitcoin is good for hedge funds and multinational corporate balance sheets proliferating through the mainstream psyche, it certainly does seem more likely that this bull has more room to run, even if we are in for some volatility in the short-term.\"\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: \"In terms of technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still trading above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily timeframe.\n\n\"As long as this remains in place, there is little to worry about the bullish trend.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Tesla scores about $1 billion in profits from Bitcoin: Wedbush's Dan Ives", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "23 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/DRFv6hd8jl8ukNhrQl4EXQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1790a240-37e3-11ea-bd6c-b09fddc3cadb", "auther": "Ines Ferr\u00e9", "body": "Tesla's (TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the electric vehicle company about $1 billion in profits \u2014 at least on paper, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives.\n\n\"That\u2019s more than all they made on EV vehicles in 2020, but that continues to be the double-edge sword.

Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC, the pair continued trending down and reached 50,900, based on the CEX.IO exchange rate, but bounced off the intraday 51,200 support level formed on 17th February and closed the hour above the open. This let BTC/USD retrace the losses in the next two hours.\n\nBTC/USD had travelled back to 52,300 by 15:00 UTC but was unable to try and test the 52,400 level of resistance and turned straight down once again between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC. The trading pair closed the hour at 51,444 as per the CEX.IO pricing and, bouncing to 52,000 between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, continued trending sideways under 52,000 for the most part until the end of the trading day. BTC/USD came under some selling pressure in the last two hours and came down from 52,110 to 51,635 at the day\u2019s end.\n\nThe lack of sufficient buying sentiment and buying trading volumes was the reason why BTC/USD could not attempt to continue its ascent past 52,400. The sideways price action shows that traders are still expecting the uptrend to continue, while market makers might be using this flat channel to make new liquidity to make a breakthrough past 52,400. The positive news factor could be a quick resolution to this stagnation around 52,000. Therefore, some positive news regarding the Bitcoin market may be enough for BTC/USD to get at 52,400 and make a breakthrough.\n\nConsidering the overall bullish sentiment dominating BTC/USD, we believe this sideways price action to be another milestone in keeping BTC/USD on the rising course. Thus, we expect the near BTC/USD target to be at around 54,300.\n\nETH/USD opened the trading session 18th February at 1,849 and made substantial upside progress in the first two hours, having broken above 1,900 by 02:00 UTC. In the next two hours, the BTC/USD trading pair came down below 1,900. From 04:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued trending sideways within a very limited price range, staying for the most part between 1,880 and 1,900.\n\nWith some upside slippage at the open of the 10:00 hourly candlestick, BTC/USD had risen above 1,920 by 11:00 UTC. Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC, the trading pair made a downside retracement, trading below 1,900 for several minutes but, having closed the hour at 1,900, continued climbing higher until the end of the day, setting multiple historical highs along the way.\n\nThe trading pair reached the day\u2019s maximum between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC, having risen to 1,950, but came all the way down to 1,920 before the day\u2019s close. Still, ETH/USD was able to close the day near the new all-time high with some very considerable upside progress at 1,936.3 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate.\n\nETH/USD added some 4.83% to its price on 18th February, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of a negative price day in BTC/USD, which showed -0.94% on the day. Ethereum is apparently largely enjoying the DeFi market growth as most of its protocols use Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAlongside, CME Ethereum futures trading volumes and open interest are growing consistently, showing the rising demand for Etherum from professional investors. The open interest for CME Ether futures had grown more than twofold from 20 million on 9th February to $62 million on 17th February, according to Glassnode.\n\nThis makes $2,000 a very close target for ETH/USD. And we see 2,342 to be the next target for ETH/USD for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Watch for Technical Bounce on First Test of 105.347 to 105.317 \n-  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 Testing Long-Term Support Zone with $1775.00 Setting the Tone \n-  AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold .7820 to Generate Enough Momentum for Move into .7916 \n-  NZD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 Strengthens Over .7232, Weakens Under .7206 \n-  Stocks Move Higher Despite Rising Bond Yields \n-  Crude Oil Price Update \u2013 Closing Price Reversal Top Confirmed; $57.31 \u2013 $56.91 Next Target Area \n"}, {"headline": "Valid Points: How CME Ether Futures Work and Why They Matter", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Wq00tZtkHE.2hxhjF86mLA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/8fa5189d0a92dc9194382bb6e8e158e3", "auther": "Christine Kim and William Foxley", "body": "Trading in ether futures went live on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) late last Sunday with the February contract registering an opening price of $1,669.75.\u00a0\n\nIn less than two weeks, the open price of the February contract has jumped 5% to $1747.75 as ether spot prices have continued to climb upwards of $1,700.\n\nIn terms of weekly trading volume, CME ether futures contracts surpassed $160 million in its first full week of trading.\u00a0\n\nRelated: How to Bring Off-Chain Assets to DeFi\n\nAccording to Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, the initial activity of the CME\u2019s market for ether futures is promising but there\u2019s still a long way to go before the product is fully established and mature enough to support other derivatives products such as options.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a really good job the first few days but obviously we want to see more in terms of on-screen liquidity. Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. \u2026 We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nThe CME Group isn\u2019t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K. announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.\u00a0\n\nWhat is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don\u2019t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME\u2019s customers.\u00a0\n\nRelated: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,\u201d said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cSome of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.\u00a0\n\nThe only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that the CME pulls data from in order to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)\n\nBut just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.\u00a0\n\nThe launch of ether futures on the CME, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto\u2019s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can\u2019t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,\u201d said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.\u00a0\n\nFutures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFutures give you a long-short optionality so you don\u2019t only have to bet one side,\u201d said Putra. \u201c[In the spot market,] you\u2019re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.\u201d\n\nFinally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.\u201d\n\nMcCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what\u2019s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.\n\n\u201cInterest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,\u201d said McCourt.\u00a0\n\nOn Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.\u00a0\n\nNow 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\u00a0\n\nOn average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.\u00a0\n- The evolution of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s roadmap (HackMD post, Ben Edgington)\n- CME ether futures explained (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Coinbase opens waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 staking (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Crypto market cap breaks $1.5 trillion as buyers show up for the dip (Article, CoinDesk)\u00a0\n- Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract tops $5.5 billion in staked ether (Article, CoinDesk)\n- Tim Beiko on how Ethereum governance works and the upcoming EIP 1559 (Podcast, cryptotesters)\n- Quick update on Eth 2.0 (Blog post, Ethereum Foundation)\n- Mark Cuban on why ETH has an advantage over BTC as a store of value (Podcast, The Defiant)\n\nFeel free to reply any time and email research@coindesk.com with your thoughts, comments or queries about today\u2019s newsletter.

The stock looks like a high-flying tech holding more than an industrial/agriculture company. That said, it does have some tech components to the business model.\n\nRegardless, this stock has been moving straight up for months now.

Why stick your neck out if you don't have to? I have my reasons for doing so this time around, so let's get into it. The SEC should move approval of a crypto ETF framework to the top of their agenda.\n\nLet me cut to the point. Then I'll tell you why I actually think this is important for folks who still read text longer than 280 characters. Here are my five arguments:\n\n1: The SEC's job is not, as is often claimed, to \"protect retail investors.\" You won't find that phrase in the '33 or '34 Acts (to my knowledge, but I'm sure some bigger nerd will counter). Instead, the heart of those two establishing acts (and most subsequent regulation) ensures that the markets work as fairly as possible. Sure, retail investors are included under the umbrella of 'investors,' but it's the system, not any specific individual, that the SEC is designed to regulate and protect. After all, it was established in response to widespread lack of faith in the capital markets following the Great Depression. The Commission is at the core about providing transparency & standardization -- making sure that all the market participants from swap dealers to Microsoft tell the truth and make sure transactions of capital flow through the economy in a standardized and verifiable way.\n\n2: The current state of access to crypto for U.S. investors is bonkers. Sure, there's an ecosystem of semi-regulated crypto exchanges. Sure, the IRS has given a little guidance so that crypto owners, traders, and investors can feel confident they won't end up Al Capone'd. But inaction by the SEC has forced the ecosystem to develop around them rather than with them. That's why we now have things like GBTC and BITW -- trusts that exist solely to trade on the least-regulated securities markets in the country, charge (sorry guys) way too much, and trade at ludicrous premia. These approaches are broken by design -- a design essentially forced by the SEC's unwilling hand.\n\n3: Like clockwork, the Ontario Securities Commission is showing us the way. Having beaten the U.S. to the punch on pretty much every significant ETF innovation (from mutual funds, to ETFs, to options-based ETFs, to non-transparent active, to rattle a few off the top of my head). The Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX: BTCC) launched this week and shot out of the gate without a hiccup. I say this not in some jingoistic 'America First' sense, but simply to point out that the OSC framework allows non-traditional assets to get wrapped up in ETFs with certain frameworks and guidelines. In other words, they created a transparent and standardized way to deal with new stuff. (It's called National Instrument 81-102). So now we have a $200 million (it will be by the time you read this) Bitcoin ETF trading just across the border.\n\n4: We actually have clear pathways to make this happen. Recent filings (and countless responses both public and private) from VanEck or Bitwise or Valkyrie have acquiesced or responded well to essentially every objection the SEC has made, whether it's been pricing sources or the lack of mainstream custody, or the impact of 'non-economic' traders. The markets have matured to the point where we have insured exchanges like Coinbase, and Bitcoin is already flowing through the balance sheets of dozens of companies and backdoor Bitcoin trading vehicles.\n\n5: Last but not least: the demand is obviously there. Bitcoin market cap is knocking on $1 Trillion. The crypto market cap will be $2 Trillion within a few months at current trends. Daily trading volumes dwarf many commodities and countless stocks. Pretending this doesn't exist isn't going to be helpful for anyone.\n\nI'm happy to wade through minutiae with readers, but the reality is that it's pretty straightforward. We know how to take a security like Bitcoin and stick it in a vault. We've been trading GLD since 2004. I want to be super clear here though: I'm still an enormous Bitcoin skeptic. I'm also a gold skeptic. Both are fundamentally psychological commodities. They have value because a group has decided they have value. That's fine: lots of things are psychological commodities, from art to collectible cars.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is the stalking horse for a much more interesting set of technologies. If you've been living in a cave (I'm a regular cave-dweller), the hot new thing in the Crypto world is decentralized finance, or 'DeFi.' This is just a catchy phrase for something a bunch of market nerds started talking about in the wake the global financial crisis: solving the last big inefficiencies of the market by using Blockchain.\n\nI will admit to being an absolute tourist here, but I've watched with real interest as DeFi has caught on. The phenomenon is actually unrelated to Bitcoin. Instead, most DeFi projects aren't a 'thing' in the sense that \"Bitcoin is a store of value.\" They're processes, ways of making other things happen. And most DeFi applications rely on the specific quirks of Ethereum and its copycats. Ethereum blends the value exchange mechanisms of cryptocurrencies (decentralized ledgers, transactions, community-based security, etc.) with the best parts of object-oriented programming and cloud computing. To really 'get it' requires a few leaps of faith, or at least it did for me. Nerdy readers like me should wade in deep, set up a private development environment, and write up some dummy 'hello world' style applications (here's where I started).\n\nEventually, I realized that smart-contracts with embedded value and computational power solve a ton of problems. Most importantly, they eliminate clearing and settlement in any traditional sense. Projects like Uniswap (or FTX, which is relatively locked down for Americans) are already replacing traditional exchange mechanisms for trading between crypto-assets. In FTX's case (U.S. Investors Need Not Apply), they've invented a system for taking stock ownership into the blockchain but nominating swap pairs of essentially any risk folks want to back (TSLA anyone?).\n\nIt's all unrelentingly cool.\n\nI'm not here to explain Uniswap and FTX, and DeFi. Smarter people are writing more exhaustive guides. But what I want to do is go back to something I mentioned two weeks ago in the chaos of the GameStop thing.\n\nIn a capitalist society, value is created or destroyed primarily in the national economy. You buy a share of stock for $100. A bunch of people decide they also like it, and it goes to $200. That $100 gain is 'trapped' on the national side of the economic barrier until you sell it and have spendable USD. That's why embedded gains 'feel' less real than cash in your bank account or coins in your pocket. They can disappear instantly should (for some exogenous reason) the very next price assigned to your stock be zero.\n\nOne of the reasons Bitcoin is so unsatisfying is because it's just so boring. All it does is store capital in the crypto-notional economy. Literally.\n\nEthereum (and its kin) is different. Uniswap, for example, needs Ethereum to work. It needs the actual tokens - the ETH itself - to do anything. So if I create a Uniswap token that allowed me to (purely hypothetically, of course) trade World of Warcraft in-game currency for airline flight miles, I need Ethereum but have no use for the U.S. Dollar. These things still have utility - the game currency allows me to participate in an activity I enjoy, the flight miles let me go on vacation. They still have notional value. They can swing wildly in relationship to each other based on supply and demand.\n\nThis is good. This is exciting. This solves real problems. It's enormously efficient. But there are real issues under the hood of how you make large-scale transactions work in this kind of environment. Folks like Uniswap and FTX have answers (like liquidity backstops and clever pooling mechanisms). But the missing link is out of their control. Which brings us to...\n\nThe Notional Barriers\n\nAs it stands, all of the intermediation between where the interesting stuff is happening (crypto) and the rest of the economy has to go through hard currency of some sort. You want to trade your shares of stock for Dogecoin, and you're going to have to go through cash and probably through a different set of accounts. It's an enormous drag on capital flow. That's why we have whole products like futures and swaps which allow you to move money around in the notional securitized economy without round-tripping through cash unless you want to.\n\nApproving a Bitcoin ETF in a vacuum -- while making a certain group of investors very happy -- isn't all that important. What is important is having a hand on the tiller for how capitalism itself evolves. What the SEC has is an opportunity to help drive the future of markets. I would argue that all of the next 20 years' interesting problems in securities markets have to do with crossing the barriers between these two notional economies and then between those economies and the real economy.\n\nWhy does crossing this notional boundary help? Quite literally, any transaction that currently involves exchanging dollars for any kind of capital asset could be made far more frictionless. House closings could take seconds with the right smart contract system. Rebalancing from stocks to bonds could become tax-less (without guidance) capital swaps. Moving any amount of capital from bucket A to bucket B could be -- with vision -- instantaneous and nearly free. That's what's at stake here: how the entire system works.\n\nAnd how do you start breaking and crossing these barriers? Step one is creating the framework for exchanging capital from the crypto notional economy and the securitized-notional economy. This is another way of saying in-kind exchange between the two, without having to buy and sell through cash. And that's just another way of describing an ETF. Remember ETFs? That's where this started. An ETF is just a vehicle for wrapping exposures in exchange tradable packages after all!) That's why we need a U.S.-listed and regulated Bitcoin ETF that uses a completely standard in-kind creation/redemption mechanism (unlike the Canadian Purpose Bitcoin ETF, which still relies on cash creations to get new Bitcoin into the trust). Bitcoin In, ETF shares out. ETF Shares in, Bitcoin Out. It's a first step in rethinking how capital moves.\n\nThe SEC (and, if we're honest, the U.S. Treasury) has a chance to lead here by working with the crypto community to create a viable framework for technologies and securities that helps smooth capital flow across these barriers.\n\nOr we can just wait for the Ontario Securities Commission to figure it out for us. They'll send us the schematics in a few years.\n\n(Obligatory caveats: I'm just one old nerd trying to keep up. If I missed something, I'm sure you'll let me know on Twitter @DaveNadig. Also, at the time of this being published, I own zero crypto assets.
