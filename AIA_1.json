"auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Some traders assume that Bitcoin\u00a0(CCC:BTC-USD) is the gold standard among cryptocurrencies. There might be merit to that claim, but let\u2019s keep an open mind. Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) also deserves a place in your crypto portfolio \u2014 and you can buy some at a discount, as the price of Ethereum dropped hard recently.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the price is still higher than it was a year ago. Actually, you could say that about the most popular cryptocurrencies in general, since they tend to move together.\n\nSo, why should you invest in Ethereum in particular? As we\u2019ll explore, this digital token could actually exhibit a level of stability that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t.\n\nEstablishing stability is important because cryptocurrency is sometimes considered to be too speculative to take seriously as an investment. Now, let\u2019s start off with a little bit of technical analysis and see if we can detect any noteworthy price patterns.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to consider that around a year ago, during the onset of the novel coronavirus crisis, the Ethereum price actually fell below $100.\n\nIn hindsight, we now know that $100 would have been a terrific buy-up price. We might never see that price again, and prospective ETH owners must now consider whether to buy it in the quadruple digits.\n\nThe price didn\u2019t reach $1,000 in 2020, but Ethereum did achieve that milestone in early January of 2021. And on Feb. 20, the price briefly touched the important $2,000 price point.\n\nBut then, a sharp multi-day pullback happened. On the morning of March 1, the price was slightly above $1,500.\n\nThere didn\u2019t seem to be any Ethereum-specific news that would cause such a sharp price drop.\n\nEvidently, a bout of profit taking occurred within the broader cryptocurrency space, and that seems to have impacted the price of ETH.\n\nIf Bitcoin has a reputation for volatility, then perhaps Ethereum should be known as a more stable cryptocurrency.\n\nIt\u2019s true that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized digital tokens, and that they\u2019re both based on blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, ETH is known for storing smart contracts, which are basically programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAnd, according to researchers Ayana T. Aspembitova, Ling Feng and Lock Yue Chew, that\u2019s not the only thing that sets the currency apart.\n\nIn a journal article titled \u201cBehavioral structure of users in cryptocurrency market,\u201d the researchers observed behavior-based differences between the two most popular cryptocurrencies:\n\n\u201c\u2026 being the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been widely used for speculative purposes\u2026 the behavior of ethereum users is observed to be more stable as these users are more optimistic of the market. In contrast, the behavior of the bitcoin users tend to fluctuate according to the trend of the market, with a loss of optimism when the market goes down.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an outcome which some folks might not have expected. Yet, I must admit that in my observation of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, the latter token does seem to exhibit less price volatility.\n\nAnd here\u2019s some more research to add to your arsenal. As reported by Nairametrics, the number of Ethereum Percent Addresses in a state of profit was recently recorded to be 96.374%.\n\nIn other words, slightly more than 96% of the circulating ETH supply is currently in a state of profit. And, that number represents a one-month low.\n\nSo, even after a major price correction, it\u2019s probably safe to conclude that the majority of Ethereum holders are profitable. I\u2019ll acknowledge that if you chased the price near $2,000, your timing wasn\u2019t necessarily ideal.\n\nYet, there\u2019s hope for a full recovery. You should expect volatility for any cryptocurrency. Thankfully, Ethereum might be less risky than some other coins.\n\nPrice fluctuations will occur, and that\u2019s a normal part of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nIf anything, the price drop in ETH should be viewed as an opportunity. And among the most popular digital tokens, Ethereum could perhaps be a comparatively stable holding.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist,\u00a0TalkMarkets,\u00a0Finom\u00a0Group,\u00a0Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

Last week\u2019s sell-off has been absorbed and the technical picture for both Bitcoin and Ethereum now looks increasingly positive. As always with the cryptocurrency, the real reason for the move is never immediately clear although a few recent actions are likely to be put forward as drivers of the recent move. A recent tweet by the CEO of a South Korean crypto-analytics firm that the large Bitcoin trades recently indicate OTC-buying by cryptocurrency \u2018whales\u2019 will have buoyed the bulls, while Goldman Sachs is said to be firing up its cryptocurrency trading desk again and will begin trading bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards. In addition, cryptocurrency miner, publicly-quoted Argo Blockchain, today said that it will pay its CEO in Bitcoin and allow other employees to be in Bitcoin if they wish.\n\nWhile in isolation these events may not spark a strong move, in combination they continue to point to increased adoption and interest in the space, a space that needs little news to spark a strong move. Emotion is a strong driver in the cryptocurrency market and if the recent move has taken out selling interest, then a fresh move higher looks the path of least resistance.\n\nHow to Manage the Emotions of Trading\n\nA look at the daily charts suggests that the recent sell-off is being pared back and if BTC/USD can regain its bullish channel, fresh all-time highs are likely.The CCI reading shows Bitcoin landed in oversold territory recently for the first time since late-January, with the previous oversold reading back in September 2020 when BTC traded around $10,000. It looks as though oversold signals have been drivers of strong rallies. The bullish channel is steep and BTC/USD will likely have to make a fresh all-time high to regain it.\n\nEthereum (ETH/USD) continues its pullback from the late-February sell-off and is looking to re-test $1,700 and potentially higher. Again the CCI indicator highlighted heavily oversold conditions, while the 50-day simple moving average helped to stem the sell-off and if closed and opened above will turn into stronger support. The next area of resistance lies between $1,700 and $1,780 before the February 20 high of $2,036 comes into play.\n\nTraders of all levels and abilities will find something to help them make more informed decisions in the new and improved DailyFX Trading Education Centre\n\nWhat are your views on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 bullish or bearish??

However, this may prove to be nothing more than a counter-trend correction, as both digital assets bounce off of key support and accelerate higher. \n\nMoreover, the endorsement of the cryptocurrency market by two major investment banks, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, could further validate the digital currency market and intensify capital inflows in the near term. Citigroup\u2019s Global Perspectives and Solutions thinktank stated that Bitcoin could become \u201cthe currency of choice for international trade\u201d, while Goldman plans to offer Bitcoin futures by the middle of this month. \n\nThis comes on the back of Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s statement that it would treat BTC the same as any other financial asset and Mastercard\u2019s commitment to integrate Bitcoin into its payment network. Tesla also announced a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin and plans to begin accepting it as a form of payment. These developments will probably underpin both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the coming weeks and may even result in resumption of the primary uptrends extending from the March 2020 nadirs. Here are the key levels to watch for BTC/USD and ETH/USD.\n\nBitcoin daily chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe formation of a bullish Hammer reversal candle at the 34-EMA (45176), followed by a Bullish Engulfing candle as validation, suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s 7-day correction lower could be at an end. \n\nWith the RSI bursting back above 50, and the MACD tracking firmly above its neutral midpoint, the path of least resistance seems skewed to topside. \n\nA daily close back above psychological resistance at 50,000 would probably intensify near-term buying pressure and generate an impulsive push to retest the yearly high (58,321). Hurdling that brings the 61.8% Fibonacci (61298) and 65,000 mark into the crosshairs.\n\nHowever, if 50,000 holds firm, a more extended pullback to former resistance-turned-support at the January high (41969) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 69.56% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.28 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.46% lower than yesterday and 25.31% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 12.22% lower than yesterday and 28.40% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Bitcoin prices may continue to fall.\n\nTraders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger Bitcoin-bearish contrarian trading bias.\n\nEthereum daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nEthereum also looks set to climb higher in the coming days, as prices surge away from confluent support at the trend-defining 55-EMA and 2018 high (1424). \n\nGaining a firm foothold back above psychological resistance at 1600 would likely pave the way for buyers to retest the yearly high (2036).

Back then, cryptocurrencies tumbled a combined 81%, wiping out almost $600 billion in market capitalization and sending Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and other altcoins on a multi-year recovery journey few want to relive.\n\nThis time however, looks slightly different. Bitcoin has far wider adoption, particularly among payment processors like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ). And high-profile thefts have also become rarer as security has improved. That makes Bitcoin far more likely to stay relevant, even as prices gyrate.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s stability comes at the expense of more limited upside. The cryptocurrency\u2019s $800 billion market cap already makes it the fifth-largest currency in the world. A doubling would make it as large as the U.S. Dollar, while 10x growth would make it more valuable than all the physical gold ever mined.\n\nThat means investors looking for the next 100x cryptocurrency need to look at altcoins \u2014 smaller cryptocurrencies that still have a chance of making it big. Because when you\u2019re buying a currency worth $10 billion, there\u2019s a far better chance of considerable gains ahead.\n\nBitcoin itself is a technological dinosaur relative to other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain transactions, for instance, cost $15 to perform and takes ten minutes to confirm.\n\nBut as the first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has maintained its lead thanks to a strong community and widespread adoption. That means successful altcoins will need far more than minor technological improvements. Bitcoin Cash, for instance, remains 80% beneath its all-time highs despite having a higher transaction per second limit than its predecessor.\n\nInstead, successful altcoins will look much more like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), a long-time favorite altcoin:\n\nAltcoins aren\u2019t necessarily for everyone. Even the most promising will stumble if programming flaws emerge \u2014 and significant initial coin offerings (ICOs) are often notoriously overpriced, leading to long-term underperformance.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s shadow will still loom over the crypto landscape, here are five promising altcoins every investor should know:\n\nAltcoins that gain scale could pose a threat to Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. The legacy cryptocurrency still relies on third parties to batch orders and act as a middleman to overcome Bitcoin\u2019s cost and lack of speed. The next generation of coins promises to perform these tasks independently. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n \n\nCardano remains one of the most advanced general-use altcoins on the market. This third-generation coin uses a proof-of-stake system, compared with the standard proof-of-work. That makes the system far more efficient than Bitcoin and faster as well.\n\nThe Cardano Foundation also has an all-star team running the show. The currency was started in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, and retains an active development community. Today, the team is led by digital payments veteran Frederik Gregaard, an old hand who once led PwC\u2019s Digital Financial Services division.\n\nADA, the currency run on the Cardano Network, has already advanced 4,400% since its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. As the currency gains greater exposure, investors ae now seeing price targets of $10 start appearing \u2014 significant upside for a coin available for less than $1 today.\n\n \n\nPolkadot was founded by another alum of the Ethereum Project \u2014 Chief Technology Officer Gavin Wood. And this altcoin takes an entirely different approach to cryptocurrencies.\n\nRather than host a single ever-growing blockchain, Polkadot uses parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that run in parallel. That solves Bitcoin\u2019s problem of managing a single ledger \u2014 one that\u2019s already over 320 GB in size.\n\nThe altcoin has seen spectacular growth since its August 2020 launch through efforts like Polkastarter, a decentralized exchange built on Polkadot. Projects have even started attracting attention from Gemini crypto exchange founders the Winklevoss twins, as well as many high-profile sports celebrities.\n\nThat makes DOT, the currency on Polkadot, one to watch closely for 2021. The currency has already grown tenfold. But with a $30 billion market cap, there\u2019s still room for this promising altcoin to run.\n\n \n\nRipple (CCC:XRP-USD) co-founder Jed McCaleb started Stellar in 2014 as an altcoin alternative to XRP. The cryptocurrency facilitates cross-border transactions by using a protocol developed by Stanford professor David Mazi\u00e8res.\n\nThe system itself uses a trusted network, where each person running the software identifies other trusted partners to confirm transactions. That removes the need for the expensive cryptographic mining Bitcoin relies on to validate transactions.\n\nStellar\u2019s fundamental reason for growth however, has more to do with rival XRP\u2019s fall. In December, the SEC charged Ripple and two executives with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering. Around half of all XRP is still owned by founding company Ripple Networks, and its ICOs triggered regulatory red flags.\n\nMeanwhile Stellar has stepped in to fill XRP\u2019s role. Its system of using trusted partners makes it an ideal replacement for quickly moving money between banks. And with a coin price less than $0.40, Stellar is a currency that could still grow many times over.\n\n \n\nCelsius is a smaller cryptocurrency focused on lending and borrowing. Interest rates for would-be borrowers start at just 1% APR, while depositors earn interest on cryptocurrency that would otherwise sit in a stagnant account. Interest rates can rise as high as 15.85% for stablecoins like Tether.\n\nCelsius Network has also wisely registered as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2018, making it far less likely to run into regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe system looks particularly promising thanks to its ease of use. Savers can transfer their entire cryptocurrency account to Celsius Network \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum and all \u2014 without converting to any proprietary coin. And borrowers can take out loans by depositing cryptocurrency, avoiding the need to cash out.\n\nThere are risks of course. An investigation by Coindesk found instances of uncollateralized lending by the network, where a borrower default would leave either Celsius Networks or P2P lenders with irreversible losses. And there\u2019s always a temptation to make riskier loans that earn higher interest payments.\n\nA sudden drop in collateral values (i.e., cryptocurrencies) can also have a knock-on effect to Celsius\u2019 value. As of writing, Celsius requires a 2.7 ETH deposit to borrow $1,000. At today\u2019s crypto prices, a borrower should willingly repay the loan to retrieve their collateral. If ETH prices plummet however, the same person might instead decide to walk away with the money, leaving Celsius investors hoping that the Network hedged its bets.\n\nNevertheless, Celsius shows a great deal of promise. CEL is highly differentiated from Bitcoin, and investment risks will decline as cryptocurrency prices eventually stabilize.\n\n \n\nInvestors might have written off Neo long ago. The China-based cryptocurrency (formerly known as Antshares) went into a tailspin back in 2018 when the Chinese Central Government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. The currency remains almost 80% down from its all-time highs.\n\nYet change is on the horizon. In April last year, the Chinese authorities began a limited rollout of e-yuan, a government-backed cryptocurrency. People expect the CCP to expand the program during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nMuch of this change comes from a recognition that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. And rather than allow outside players like Bitcoin and Ethereum to push finance out of the CCP\u2019s sight, they have started embracing home-grown cryptocurrencies as alternatives.\n\nSmaller Chinese-based cryptocurrencies have already started emerging. VeChain, another promising cryptocurrency, helps Chinese companies with supply-chain management.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to know if the CCP will also anoint Neo a cryptocurrency champion, there\u2019s phenomenal upside to be had if they do.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin\u2019s Nosedive below $45,000 Can Open Way to Continued Correction, Ethereum\u2019s Repeats after...", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/_vAsLCzb6bVpoG_f0ZCrrg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/b76915b30c62f709fbe1d1291f267707", "auther": "Anissimov Konstantin", "body": "BTC/USD started the week at 57,499 near the all-time high at 58,400, based on the CEX.IOpricing. In the first four hours of Monday\u2019s trading session, BTC/USD declined to 56,000, which was an important support level in intraday terms. The level produced some buying pressure for the pair but only for the next four hours, as BTC/USD closed the 4-hour candlestick between 04:00 and 08:00 UTC at 46,479.\n\nThat, however, made no lasting influence, and BTC/USD had broken down below 56,000 and dropped below 53,500 by 16:00 UTC. That was a signal for a big sale, as the Bitcoin market had been overheated. In confirmation of that hypothesis, BTC/USD made a huge rollercoaster swing in the interval between 13:00 and 15:00 UTC, falling from 53,677 to 47,400 and bouncing back up. Meanwhile, Glassnode, an on-chain data aggregator reported that high-net-worth Bitcoin holders had sold 140,000 BTC, which was proof of traders\u2019 readiness to sell BTC/USD big time. There was a slight upside recovery to 56,000 at the end of Monday, but with the start of Tuesday\u2019s session the selling went on.\n\nBy 09:00 UTC of Tuesday, 23rd February, BTC/USD had already been at 46,500 as per Bitstamp\u2019s exchange rate. Form 09:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued sideways, with high volatility taking place in the price action. The pair was edging sideways within the corridor of 45,000 \u2013 49,000 until 01:00 UTC of Wednesday, 24th February. At that time a rebound above 49,000 started to take place and continued until 05:00 UTC, with 51,000 topped out.\n\nThe volatility reduced considerably, as the pair continued edging sideways within the price range of 50,000 \u2013 51,000. At 13:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, a drawdown to 49,000 happened; afterwards, BTC/USD continued between 48,000 \u2013 50,000 until the end of Wednesday. The sideways fluctuations continued on Thursday, 25th February, until 12:00 UTC. At 12:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, BTC/USD bounced to 52,000. Afterwards, BTC/USD began another continued downfall, which continued to 45,000 on Friday, 26th February. The falling stopped at 08:00 UTC, as the zone offered a buying opportunity.\n\nBTC/USD had bounced to 48,265 by 17:00 UTC and then reversed downwards until 23:00 UTC, almost reaching 45,000, and closed Friday at 45,447. On Saturday, 27th February, BTC/USD the bulls continued supporting the trading pair with buying volumes, and BTC/USD briefly rose to 48,100 between 0200 \u2013 02:45 UTC. The pair continued sideways until 07:00 UTC, once breaking above the 50-period hourly SMA, but was eventually driven down below 47,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC. The upside attempts at the SMA continued unsuccessfully until the end of Saturday. On Sunday, 28th February, selling pressure increased and saw BTC/USD gradually head down to 43,067 at its lowest. The capitalisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was an indication of continuing selling bias in the trading pair.\n\nThere was some news in the week of 22nd February that kept up Bitcoin bulls\u2019 hopes of an upside recovery. Square, Inc. that had invested $50,000 million in Bitcoin in October 2020 made another Bitcoin purchase worth $170 million on 24th February 2021. Besides that, MicroStrategy \u2013 the corporate frontrunner among Bitcoin investors \u2013 bought 19,452 more BTC worth $1.026 billion at an average price of $52,765. This new purchase had brought MicroStrategy\u2019s exposure to Bitcoin to 90,531 BTC.\n\nThese tendencies clearly showed that high profile investors were happy with the Bitcoin drawdown and were ready to buy the dip. This shows that Bitcoin continues to be looked upon as a solid financial instrument, and every downside correction is going to be met with substantial buying volumes.\n\nThe decline to nearly 43,000 and a stabilisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was a signal of continuing bearish bias in BTC/USD, promising lower lows. Still, some bullish momentum remains to be present, and a breakthrough above 48,000 and above the 50-period 4-hour SMA would signal a change of bias and an upside recovery gaining traction. On the contrary, another decline to 43,000 will mean a continuation of bearish price action, with prospects of getting back to testing the 31,000 support level.\n\nTherefore, we shall soon get answers on where BTC/USD will go next. With the pair edging higher towards 48,000 in the morning hours of Monday, the odds for a breakthrough are presently going higher.\n\nETH/USD opened the week of 22nd February at 1,933.4 and headed straight down from the start of the day, briefly getting below the 50-period 4-hour SMA with the lower wick of Monday\u2019s first 4-hour candlestick reaching 1,867.3. The SMA gave ETH/USD some transitory support, but it continued sinking lower until 09:00 UTC on Tuesday, 23rd February, with support being found at 1,440. The trading pair continued sideways until the end of Tuesday, fluctuating within a considerable range of 1,360 and 1,600.\n\nFrom the start of Wednesday, 24th February, the ETH/USD trading pair headed upwards to reach 1,715 and break above the 50-period hourly SMA. The volatility shrank considerably, as ETH/USD spent most of the time until 18:00 UTC on Thursday, 25th February within the range of 1,586.4 \u2013 1,662, being regularly supported by the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nETH/USD, ETH/USD headed down from 18:00 UTC on Thursday through to 08:00 UTC on Friday, 26th February. The pair eventually hit 1,402 at the minimum and continued edging sideways between 1,424.7 and 1,560 until the end of Saturday, 27th February, with the 50-period hourly SMA upkeeping the ETH/USD bearish momentum.\n\nAnother downswing took place on Sunday, 28th February, with a minimum at 1,299.6. However, an upside recovery that began at 19:00 UTC and continued through to the end of Sunday, with the 1,392.2 support level letting ETH/USD close the week at 1,417.5 as per the CEX.IO pricing. On top of that, ETH/USD finished Sunday in a hammer candlestick on the daily timeframe, which coupled with the 1,420 support level gives increased potential for a full-fledged upside recovery in the near term.\n\nIt became known that the intraday pullback in ETH/USD between Tuesday, 23rd February, and Wednesday, 24th February, from the mid-to-lower 1,400s to above 1,700 coincided with a purchase of 10,000 ETH by Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which brought its Ether exposure to 3.17 ETH.\n\nThe bullish market reaction to the purchase clearly shows that big players\u2019 moves have a strong impact on the Ethereum market. And the purchase itself shows that high-profile investors, who constitute most of Grayscale clients, have trust in Ethereum in the long term, which can result in continued market growth for the smart-contract pioneer.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Continues to Show Strength \n-  S&P 500 Price Forecast \u2013 Stock Markets Recover on Monday \n-  Target Has Strong Upside Potential; Likely to Log Over 50% Jump in Q4 Profit \n-  GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues Noisy Behavior \n-  GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Gives up Early Gains \n-  Stocks Move Higher At The Start Of The Month \n"}, {"headline": "BTC/USD stagnates under 50,000, ETH/USD sinks under 1,500", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/1.CMBbcF7Ty_T6LdBMUGSg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3163aad28e8c2f2b8cadc514cd079893", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "BTC/USD made a bullish attack at 50,000 early on 2nd March, but it was swiftly curbed by the mark, with the pair finding itself under 48,000 at the end of the day. Buying pressure was still there, but more buying volumes might be required for a pullback above 50,000 to come through.\n\nBTC/USD opened 2nd March at 49,720 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair edged above 50,000 in the first hour but found itself at 49,556 at the hour\u2019s close. An intraday retracement took the pair to 48,354 at 08:00 UTC. Having risen above 49,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC, the pair continued sideways until 16:00, clinging to the 49,000 handle. By 16:00 UTC, a head-and-shoulders-looking pattern had formed and was confirmed with a bearish candlestick between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC that landed on 47,500 and the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nThe moving average did support the price, signaling some lack of confidence of the bears and the presence of buying appetite. The pair continued trending mildly upwards, consistently leaning on the 50-period hourly moving average until 19:00 UTC, but slipped below it at 20:00 UTC.\n\nThe failure of the breakthrough above 50,000, should extend the expectations of an exit out the horizontal channel between 43,000 and 50,000. The update on corporate and institutional holdings from Bitcointreasuries.com on the day showed that the cumulative figure had reached 1.36 million BTC worth around $65 billion at the time. This is an apparent sign of continuing demand for Bitcoin from high-profile investors. Considering their traditional long-term investment fashion, their demand might play a key role in Bitcoin\u2019s financial maturity.\n\nETH/USD spent most of the trading session of 2nd March between 1,540 and 1,580. Selling pressure increased at 16:00 UTC, and the trading pair slipped to under 1,500 in the day\u2019s later hours.\u00a0\n\nETH/USD started 2nd March at 1,572 and produced a sharp spike to 1,600. But the buying volumes were too small, and the pair quickly got back to 1,570, continuing sideways between 1,540 and 1,580 for the most part until 16:00 UTC. Between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, ETH/USD broke down below 1,540 and closed the hour at 1,503.5 based on the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair was consistently heading down afterwards and slipped to 1,460 \u2013 1,480 in the period between 20:00 \u2013 23:00 UTC.\n\nMeanwhile, The Block shows that Ethereum miners set a new record for monthly earnings in February 2021, having earned $1.37 billion during the 28-day-long month. Of those, $772.78 million were transaction fees and $644.4 million were block rewards, which is the first precedent of transaction fees dominating block rewards in Ethereum miners\u2019 revenues on a monthly basis in all of Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nThis shows how much demand is going on for Ethereum as a means of transfer of value, the DeFi market probably being the biggest driver of that demand, as its market capitalisation grew to 71.87 billion, according to CoinGecko, as of 2nd March. Also, the anticipation of the transition of Ethereum to the PoS Beacon Chain is heating up demand for Ether as a means of passive income: according to The Block, the ETH 2.0 deposit contract had 3.33 million ETH on 2nd March.\n\nETH/USD might have found a resting point between 1,460 \u2013 1,570 and may continue sideways on shrinking volatility for a while before taking a turn outside this corridor. The 1,392 daily support level can be a source of resurging buying pressure for ETH/USD in the scenario of a gradual decline.\n"}, {"headline": "Kings of Leon NFT Album: 17 Things to Know as the Rock Album Goes Digital", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/bsE5E5QZ6y_tR2wjagS_8g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/9d4966ecff929dbfd34f5681bdb729ff", "auther": "Vivian Medithi ", "body": "American rock band Kings of Leon have announced their next album will be released as a non-fungible token (NFT) this Friday, just the latest high-profile digital collectible coming to market at a time of skyrocketing interest in cryptoassets.\n\n \n\nHere\u2019s what investors should know about the new album, \u201cNFT Yourself,\u201d coming out Friday, March 5:\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH uptrend to $2,000 in grave danger amid flashing sell signals", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/REIeQHMAYcmTIXjf3ot2qQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bfcbe8c59e51f681a528c61f971e9894", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Ethereum's technical breakout on Monday had a target close to $1,700, but the price recovery failed to overcome the barrier at $1,600.

While we have increasingly become a digitalization-of-everything economy, our payment processing solutions remain curiously archaic. Stellar offers a viable alternative but does that necessarily bode well for its XLM cryptocurrency token?\n\n \n\nI\u2019m going to dive into the nuances of this question. But first, I believe the integration of the Stellar Lumens blockchain technology into mainstream financial institutions should be encouraged. And at some point, you\u2019d figure that this staid industry will be forced to accept that we live in the 21st century.\n\nRecently, I had the displeasure of having to make a wire transfer to another U.S.-based bank. The cost to me was $25 to make the transfer. Additionally, the time it took for the wire transfer to process, along with associated filings was about one week \u2013 that\u2019s an eternity in our supposedly advanced society.\n\nOn the flipside, cryptocurrency transactions occur much quicker and cheaper. Earlier this year, I made several Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) transactions, with the process taking a few hours to complete and with transaction fees in the single-digit dollar range.\n\nHowever, crypto proponents consider Bitcoin as the transactional laggard in this space. Other cryptocurrency transactions, such as through the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) or Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) blockchains occur at lightning-fast speeds and with more modest fees.\n\nAnd this is where Stellar Lumens truly shines. The platform is one of the fastest. Better yet, because of its low flat fees, Stellar opens the door to a viable micropayments economy. In turn, this will help bring the developing part of the world into the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nPlus, we don\u2019t even have to think so globally. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 5.4% or roughly 7.1 million households were unbanked in 2019. Due to the pandemic and the resultant economic crisis, this figure will surely increase.\n\nBefore I go any further into the investment proposition of Stellar Lumens, I need to make a comprehensive disclosure. Yes, I own XLM tokens, but the amount that I have now is a pittance compared to my prior holdings.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m necessarily bearish on XLM. However, when the cryptocurrency market started going sour a little over a week ago, I began taking evasive action. I converted some of my XLM holdings into BTC and some into cold hard cash.\n\nAs I watch the Stellar Lumens token tumble downward \u2013 albeit with a few head fakes here and there \u2013 I\u2019m regretting that I didn\u2019t go all into cash. Oh well. If I\u2019ve learned anything about cryptocurrencies over the years, you just never know where they might end up.\n\nExcept that I did know \u2013 at least, in my own mind. Aside from my own second guessing, the XLM price action looked weak following its trend collapse on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23. Subsequent trades have attempted to push the price back up toward 50 cents, but to no avail.\n\nCan the Stellar Lumens token recover that support level and make its way toward all-time highs? Perhaps, but that will likely depend on Bitcoin. Unfortunately, from where I stand Bitcoin looks like a basket case. Gone is the moxie that took the original virtual currency to the edge of $60,000. Instead, BTC stakeholders should consider themselves fortunate if it doesn\u2019t fall below $40,000.\n\nBelow $40K? Yeah, it can happen (though of course I\u2019m not guaranteeing it) precisely for the same reason why the cryptocurrencies started skyrocketing earlier this year: big institutions are embracing this digital revolution. They\u2019re wonderful to have when they\u2019re driving up the asset. But if these alpha dogs decide to sell, the volatility could be unprecedented.\n\nAs Bitcoin reaches down and cuts into institutional profits, you can rest assured that they\u2019ll dump like mad to preserve their wealth.\n\nThen, you also must factor in human concerns such as tax season and rising bond yields. For the former, Tax Day is approaching, which means profit taking may be in order to help ease the burden imposed by Uncle Sam.\n\nBut the latter case is the most intriguing one for me. The sudden rise in yields not only demonstrates that the incentive to hold risk-on assets is diminishing, it highlights that cryptocurrencies represent the riskiest asset class of them all. It doesn\u2019t pay dividends and it has severe third-party risk in terms of government intervention and/or cyberattacks.\n\nIf the Russians can compromise our most secure assets, then a disruptive attack on the crypto ecosystem seems like child\u2019s play.\n\nFor me, there seems to be too many questions to be comfortable wagering on Stellar Lumens right now. Personally, I\u2019d wait until Bitcoin stabilizes. If not, a low-30-cent/high-20-cent price range wouldn\u2019t be too surprising given the context.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in XLM, BTC, ETH, LTC.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

"auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Some traders assume that Bitcoin\u00a0(CCC:BTC-USD) is the gold standard among cryptocurrencies. There might be merit to that claim, but let\u2019s keep an open mind. Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) also deserves a place in your crypto portfolio \u2014 and you can buy some at a discount, as the price of Ethereum dropped hard recently.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the price is still higher than it was a year ago. Actually, you could say that about the most popular cryptocurrencies in general, since they tend to move together.\n\nSo, why should you invest in Ethereum in particular? As we\u2019ll explore, this digital token could actually exhibit a level of stability that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t.\n\nEstablishing stability is important because cryptocurrency is sometimes considered to be too speculative to take seriously as an investment. Now, let\u2019s start off with a little bit of technical analysis and see if we can detect any noteworthy price patterns.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to consider that around a year ago, during the onset of the novel coronavirus crisis, the Ethereum price actually fell below $100.\n\nIn hindsight, we now know that $100 would have been a terrific buy-up price. We might never see that price again, and prospective ETH owners must now consider whether to buy it in the quadruple digits.\n\nThe price didn\u2019t reach $1,000 in 2020, but Ethereum did achieve that milestone in early January of 2021. And on Feb. 20, the price briefly touched the important $2,000 price point.\n\nBut then, a sharp multi-day pullback happened. On the morning of March 1, the price was slightly above $1,500.\n\nThere didn\u2019t seem to be any Ethereum-specific news that would cause such a sharp price drop.\n\nEvidently, a bout of profit taking occurred within the broader cryptocurrency space, and that seems to have impacted the price of ETH.\n\nIf Bitcoin has a reputation for volatility, then perhaps Ethereum should be known as a more stable cryptocurrency.\n\nIt\u2019s true that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized digital tokens, and that they\u2019re both based on blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, ETH is known for storing smart contracts, which are basically programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAnd, according to researchers Ayana T. Aspembitova, Ling Feng and Lock Yue Chew, that\u2019s not the only thing that sets the currency apart.\n\nIn a journal article titled \u201cBehavioral structure of users in cryptocurrency market,\u201d the researchers observed behavior-based differences between the two most popular cryptocurrencies:\n\n\u201c\u2026 being the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been widely used for speculative purposes\u2026 the behavior of ethereum users is observed to be more stable as these users are more optimistic of the market. In contrast, the behavior of the bitcoin users tend to fluctuate according to the trend of the market, with a loss of optimism when the market goes down.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an outcome which some folks might not have expected. Yet, I must admit that in my observation of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, the latter token does seem to exhibit less price volatility.\n\nAnd here\u2019s some more research to add to your arsenal. As reported by Nairametrics, the number of Ethereum Percent Addresses in a state of profit was recently recorded to be 96.374%.\n\nIn other words, slightly more than 96% of the circulating ETH supply is currently in a state of profit. And, that number represents a one-month low.\n\nSo, even after a major price correction, it\u2019s probably safe to conclude that the majority of Ethereum holders are profitable. I\u2019ll acknowledge that if you chased the price near $2,000, your timing wasn\u2019t necessarily ideal.\n\nYet, there\u2019s hope for a full recovery. You should expect volatility for any cryptocurrency. Thankfully, Ethereum might be less risky than some other coins.\n\nPrice fluctuations will occur, and that\u2019s a normal part of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nIf anything, the price drop in ETH should be viewed as an opportunity. And among the most popular digital tokens, Ethereum could perhaps be a comparatively stable holding.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist,\u00a0TalkMarkets,\u00a0Finom\u00a0Group,\u00a0Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

However, this may prove to be nothing more than a counter-trend correction, as both digital assets bounce off of key support and accelerate higher. \n\nMoreover, the endorsement of the cryptocurrency market by two major investment banks, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, could further validate the digital currency market and intensify capital inflows in the near term. Citigroup\u2019s Global Perspectives and Solutions thinktank stated that Bitcoin could become \u201cthe currency of choice for international trade\u201d, while Goldman plans to offer Bitcoin futures by the middle of this month. \n\nThis comes on the back of Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s statement that it would treat BTC the same as any other financial asset and Mastercard\u2019s commitment to integrate Bitcoin into its payment network. Tesla also announced a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin and plans to begin accepting it as a form of payment. These developments will probably underpin both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the coming weeks and may even result in resumption of the primary uptrends extending from the March 2020 nadirs. Here are the key levels to watch for BTC/USD and ETH/USD.\n\nBitcoin daily chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe formation of a bullish Hammer reversal candle at the 34-EMA (45176), followed by a Bullish Engulfing candle as validation, suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s 7-day correction lower could be at an end. \n\nWith the RSI bursting back above 50, and the MACD tracking firmly above its neutral midpoint, the path of least resistance seems skewed to topside. \n\nA daily close back above psychological resistance at 50,000 would probably intensify near-term buying pressure and generate an impulsive push to retest the yearly high (58,321). Hurdling that brings the 61.8% Fibonacci (61298) and 65,000 mark into the crosshairs.\n\nHowever, if 50,000 holds firm, a more extended pullback to former resistance-turned-support at the January high (41969) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 69.56% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.28 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.46% lower than yesterday and 25.31% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 12.22% lower than yesterday and 28.40% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Bitcoin prices may continue to fall.\n\nTraders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger Bitcoin-bearish contrarian trading bias.\n\nEthereum daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nEthereum also looks set to climb higher in the coming days, as prices surge away from confluent support at the trend-defining 55-EMA and 2018 high (1424). \n\nGaining a firm foothold back above psychological resistance at 1600 would likely pave the way for buyers to retest the yearly high (2036). A daily close above is ultimately needed to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and bring the 100% Fibonacci (2410) into focus. \n\nAlternatively, a daily close below range support at 1400 \u2013 1440 could encourage would-be sellers and result in a pullback to mobile support at the 100-MA (1108). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 86.84% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 6.60 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.39% lower than yesterday and 24.39% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 16.22% lower than yesterday and 21.72% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Ethereum prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed Ethereum trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin (BTC/USD), Ethereum (ETH/USD) Rallying Sharply as the Bulls Wrestle Back Control", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/N8NkPHuyCUNK.Mw1v5Swtg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/ed541f1965e6c7bb14b43c8cfe11bed2", "auther": "Nick Cawley", "body": "A sea of green in the cryptocurrency space with some coins recording early double-digit gains. Last week\u2019s sell-off has been absorbed and the technical picture for both Bitcoin and Ethereum now looks increasingly positive. As always with the cryptocurrency, the real reason for the move is never immediately clear although a few recent actions are likely to be put forward as drivers of the recent move. A recent tweet by the CEO of a South Korean crypto-analytics firm that the large Bitcoin trades recently indicate OTC-buying by cryptocurrency \u2018whales\u2019 will have buoyed the bulls, while Goldman Sachs is said to be firing up its cryptocurrency trading desk again and will begin trading bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards. In addition, cryptocurrency miner, publicly-quoted Argo Blockchain, today said that it will pay its CEO in Bitcoin and allow other employees to be in Bitcoin if they wish.\n\nWhile in isolation these events may not spark a strong move, in combination they continue to point to increased adoption and interest in the space, a space that needs little news to spark a strong move. Emotion is a strong driver in the cryptocurrency market and if the recent move has taken out selling interest, then a fresh move higher looks the path of least resistance.\n\nHow to Manage the Emotions of Trading\n\nA look at the daily charts suggests that the recent sell-off is being pared back and if BTC/USD can regain its bullish channel, fresh all-time highs are likely.The CCI reading shows Bitcoin landed in oversold territory recently for the first time since late-January, with the previous oversold reading back in September 2020 when BTC traded around $10,000. It looks as though oversold signals have been drivers of strong rallies. The bullish channel is steep and BTC/USD will likely have to make a fresh all-time high to regain it.\n\nEthereum (ETH/USD) continues its pullback from the late-February sell-off and is looking to re-test $1,700 and potentially higher. Again the CCI indicator highlighted heavily oversold conditions, while the 50-day simple moving average helped to stem the sell-off and if closed and opened above will turn into stronger support. The next area of resistance lies between $1,700 and $1,780 before the February 20 high of $2,036 comes into play.\n\nTraders of all levels and abilities will find something to help them make more informed decisions in the new and improved DailyFX Trading Education Centre\n\nWhat are your views on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 bullish or bearish??

Back then, cryptocurrencies tumbled a combined 81%, wiping out almost $600 billion in market capitalization and sending Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and other altcoins on a multi-year recovery journey few want to relive.\n\nThis time however, looks slightly different. Bitcoin has far wider adoption, particularly among payment processors like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ). And high-profile thefts have also become rarer as security has improved. That makes Bitcoin far more likely to stay relevant, even as prices gyrate.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s stability comes at the expense of more limited upside. The cryptocurrency\u2019s $800 billion market cap already makes it the fifth-largest currency in the world. A doubling would make it as large as the U.S. Dollar, while 10x growth would make it more valuable than all the physical gold ever mined.\n\nThat means investors looking for the next 100x cryptocurrency need to look at altcoins \u2014 smaller cryptocurrencies that still have a chance of making it big. Because when you\u2019re buying a currency worth $10 billion, there\u2019s a far better chance of considerable gains ahead.\n\nBitcoin itself is a technological dinosaur relative to other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain transactions, for instance, cost $15 to perform and takes ten minutes to confirm.\n\nBut as the first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has maintained its lead thanks to a strong community and widespread adoption. That means successful altcoins will need far more than minor technological improvements. Bitcoin Cash, for instance, remains 80% beneath its all-time highs despite having a higher transaction per second limit than its predecessor.\n\nInstead, successful altcoins will look much more like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), a long-time favorite altcoin:\n\nAltcoins aren\u2019t necessarily for everyone. Even the most promising will stumble if programming flaws emerge \u2014 and significant initial coin offerings (ICOs) are often notoriously overpriced, leading to long-term underperformance.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s shadow will still loom over the crypto landscape, here are five promising altcoins every investor should know:\n\nAltcoins that gain scale could pose a threat to Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. The legacy cryptocurrency still relies on third parties to batch orders and act as a middleman to overcome Bitcoin\u2019s cost and lack of speed. The next generation of coins promises to perform these tasks independently. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n \n\nCardano remains one of the most advanced general-use altcoins on the market. This third-generation coin uses a proof-of-stake system, compared with the standard proof-of-work. That makes the system far more efficient than Bitcoin and faster as well.\n\nThe Cardano Foundation also has an all-star team running the show. The currency was started in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, and retains an active development community. Today, the team is led by digital payments veteran Frederik Gregaard, an old hand who once led PwC\u2019s Digital Financial Services division.\n\nADA, the currency run on the Cardano Network, has already advanced 4,400% since its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. As the currency gains greater exposure, investors ae now seeing price targets of $10 start appearing \u2014 significant upside for a coin available for less than $1 today.\n\n \n\nPolkadot was founded by another alum of the Ethereum Project \u2014 Chief Technology Officer Gavin Wood. And this altcoin takes an entirely different approach to cryptocurrencies.\n\nRather than host a single ever-growing blockchain, Polkadot uses parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that run in parallel. That solves Bitcoin\u2019s problem of managing a single ledger \u2014 one that\u2019s already over 320 GB in size.\n\nThe altcoin has seen spectacular growth since its August 2020 launch through efforts like Polkastarter, a decentralized exchange built on Polkadot. Projects have even started attracting attention from Gemini crypto exchange founders the Winklevoss twins, as well as many high-profile sports celebrities.\n\nThat makes DOT, the currency on Polkadot, one to watch closely for 2021. The currency has already grown tenfold. But with a $30 billion market cap, there\u2019s still room for this promising altcoin to run.\n\n \n\nRipple (CCC:XRP-USD) co-founder Jed McCaleb started Stellar in 2014 as an altcoin alternative to XRP. The cryptocurrency facilitates cross-border transactions by using a protocol developed by Stanford professor David Mazi\u00e8res.\n\nThe system itself uses a trusted network, where each person running the software identifies other trusted partners to confirm transactions. That removes the need for the expensive cryptographic mining Bitcoin relies on to validate transactions.\n\nStellar\u2019s fundamental reason for growth however, has more to do with rival XRP\u2019s fall. In December, the SEC charged Ripple and two executives with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering. Around half of all XRP is still owned by founding company Ripple Networks, and its ICOs triggered regulatory red flags.\n\nMeanwhile Stellar has stepped in to fill XRP\u2019s role. Its system of using trusted partners makes it an ideal replacement for quickly moving money between banks. And with a coin price less than $0.40, Stellar is a currency that could still grow many times over.\n\n \n\nCelsius is a smaller cryptocurrency focused on lending and borrowing. Interest rates for would-be borrowers start at just 1% APR, while depositors earn interest on cryptocurrency that would otherwise sit in a stagnant account. Interest rates can rise as high as 15.85% for stablecoins like Tether.\n\nCelsius Network has also wisely registered as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2018, making it far less likely to run into regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe system looks particularly promising thanks to its ease of use. Savers can transfer their entire cryptocurrency account to Celsius Network \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum and all \u2014 without converting to any proprietary coin. And borrowers can take out loans by depositing cryptocurrency, avoiding the need to cash out.\n\nThere are risks of course. An investigation by Coindesk found instances of uncollateralized lending by the network, where a borrower default would leave either Celsius Networks or P2P lenders with irreversible losses. And there\u2019s always a temptation to make riskier loans that earn higher interest payments.\n\nA sudden drop in collateral values (i.e., cryptocurrencies) can also have a knock-on effect to Celsius\u2019 value. As of writing, Celsius requires a 2.7 ETH deposit to borrow $1,000. At today\u2019s crypto prices, a borrower should willingly repay the loan to retrieve their collateral. If ETH prices plummet however, the same person might instead decide to walk away with the money, leaving Celsius investors hoping that the Network hedged its bets.\n\nNevertheless, Celsius shows a great deal of promise. CEL is highly differentiated from Bitcoin, and investment risks will decline as cryptocurrency prices eventually stabilize.\n\n \n\nInvestors might have written off Neo long ago. The China-based cryptocurrency (formerly known as Antshares) went into a tailspin back in 2018 when the Chinese Central Government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. The currency remains almost 80% down from its all-time highs.\n\nYet change is on the horizon. In April last year, the Chinese authorities began a limited rollout of e-yuan, a government-backed cryptocurrency. People expect the CCP to expand the program during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nMuch of this change comes from a recognition that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. And rather than allow outside players like Bitcoin and Ethereum to push finance out of the CCP\u2019s sight, they have started embracing home-grown cryptocurrencies as alternatives.\n\nSmaller Chinese-based cryptocurrencies have already started emerging. VeChain, another promising cryptocurrency, helps Chinese companies with supply-chain management.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to know if the CCP will also anoint Neo a cryptocurrency champion, there\u2019s phenomenal upside to be had if they do.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin\u2019s Nosedive below $45,000 Can Open Way to Continued Correction, Ethereum\u2019s Repeats after...", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/_vAsLCzb6bVpoG_f0ZCrrg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/b76915b30c62f709fbe1d1291f267707", "auther": "Anissimov Konstantin", "body": "BTC/USD started the week at 57,499 near the all-time high at 58,400, based on the CEX.IOpricing.

The level produced some buying pressure for the pair but only for the next four hours, as BTC/USD closed the 4-hour candlestick between 04:00 and 08:00 UTC at 46,479.\n\nThat, however, made no lasting influence, and BTC/USD had broken down below 56,000 and dropped below 53,500 by 16:00 UTC. That was a signal for a big sale, as the Bitcoin market had been overheated. In confirmation of that hypothesis, BTC/USD made a huge rollercoaster swing in the interval between 13:00 and 15:00 UTC, falling from 53,677 to 47,400 and bouncing back up. Meanwhile, Glassnode, an on-chain data aggregator reported that high-net-worth Bitcoin holders had sold 140,000 BTC, which was proof of traders\u2019 readiness to sell BTC/USD big time. There was a slight upside recovery to 56,000 at the end of Monday, but with the start of Tuesday\u2019s session the selling went on.\n\nBy 09:00 UTC of Tuesday, 23rd February, BTC/USD had already been at 46,500 as per Bitstamp\u2019s exchange rate.

At that time a rebound above 49,000 started to take place and continued until 05:00 UTC, with 51,000 topped out.\n\nThe volatility reduced considerably, as the pair continued edging sideways within the price range of 50,000 \u2013 51,000. At 13:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, a drawdown to 49,000 happened; afterwards, BTC/USD continued between 48,000 \u2013 50,000 until the end of Wednesday. The sideways fluctuations continued on Thursday, 25th February, until 12:00 UTC. At 12:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, BTC/USD bounced to 52,000. Afterwards, BTC/USD began another continued downfall, which continued to 45,000 on Friday, 26th February. The falling stopped at 08:00 UTC, as the zone offered a buying opportunity.\n\nBTC/USD had bounced to 48,265 by 17:00 UTC and then reversed downwards until 23:00 UTC, almost reaching 45,000, and closed Friday at 45,447. On Saturday, 27th February, BTC/USD the bulls continued supporting the trading pair with buying volumes, and BTC/USD briefly rose to 48,100 between 0200 \u2013 02:45 UTC. The pair continued sideways until 07:00 UTC, once breaking above the 50-period hourly SMA, but was eventually driven down below 47,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC. The upside attempts at the SMA continued unsuccessfully until the end of Saturday. On Sunday, 28th February, selling pressure increased and saw BTC/USD gradually head down to 43,067 at its lowest. The capitalisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was an indication of continuing selling bias in the trading pair.\n\nThere was some news in the week of 22nd February that kept up Bitcoin bulls\u2019 hopes of an upside recovery. Square, Inc. that had invested $50,000 million in Bitcoin in October 2020 made another Bitcoin purchase worth $170 million on 24th February 2021. Besides that, MicroStrategy \u2013 the corporate frontrunner among Bitcoin investors \u2013 bought 19,452 more BTC worth $1.026 billion at an average price of $52,765. This new purchase had brought MicroStrategy\u2019s exposure to Bitcoin to 90,531 BTC.\n\nThese tendencies clearly showed that high profile investors were happy with the Bitcoin drawdown and were ready to buy the dip. This shows that Bitcoin continues to be looked upon as a solid financial instrument, and every downside correction is going to be met with substantial buying volumes.\n\nThe decline to nearly 43,000 and a stabilisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was a signal of continuing bearish bias in BTC/USD, promising lower lows. Still, some bullish momentum remains to be present, and a breakthrough above 48,000 and above the 50-period 4-hour SMA would signal a change of bias and an upside recovery gaining traction. On the contrary, another decline to 43,000 will mean a continuation of bearish price action, with prospects of getting back to testing the 31,000 support level.\n\nTherefore, we shall soon get answers on where BTC/USD will go next. With the pair edging higher towards 48,000 in the morning hours of Monday, the odds for a breakthrough are presently going higher.\n\nETH/USD opened the week of 22nd February at 1,933.4 and headed straight down from the start of the day, briefly getting below the 50-period 4-hour SMA with the lower wick of Monday\u2019s first 4-hour candlestick reaching 1,867.3. The SMA gave ETH/USD some transitory support, but it continued sinking lower until 09:00 UTC on Tuesday, 23rd February, with support being found at 1,440. The trading pair continued sideways until the end of Tuesday, fluctuating within a considerable range of 1,360 and 1,600.\n\nFrom the start of Wednesday, 24th February, the ETH/USD trading pair headed upwards to reach 1,715 and break above the 50-period hourly SMA. The volatility shrank considerably, as ETH/USD spent most of the time until 18:00 UTC on Thursday, 25th February within the range of 1,586.4 \u2013 1,662, being regularly supported by the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nETH/USD, ETH/USD headed down from 18:00 UTC on Thursday through to 08:00 UTC on Friday, 26th February. The pair eventually hit 1,402 at the minimum and continued edging sideways between 1,424.7 and 1,560 until the end of Saturday, 27th February, with the 50-period hourly SMA upkeeping the ETH/USD bearish momentum.\n\nAnother downswing took place on Sunday, 28th February, with a minimum at 1,299.6. However, an upside recovery that began at 19:00 UTC and continued through to the end of Sunday, with the 1,392.2 support level letting ETH/USD close the week at 1,417.5 as per the CEX.IO pricing. On top of that, ETH/USD finished Sunday in a hammer candlestick on the daily timeframe, which coupled with the 1,420 support level gives increased potential for a full-fledged upside recovery in the near term.\n\nIt became known that the intraday pullback in ETH/USD between Tuesday, 23rd February, and Wednesday, 24th February, from the mid-to-lower 1,400s to above 1,700 coincided with a purchase of 10,000 ETH by Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which brought its Ether exposure to 3.17 ETH.\n\nThe bullish market reaction to the purchase clearly shows that big players\u2019 moves have a strong impact on the Ethereum market. And the purchase itself shows that high-profile investors, who constitute most of Grayscale clients, have trust in Ethereum in the long term, which can result in continued market growth for the smart-contract pioneer.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Continues to Show Strength \n-  S&P 500 Price Forecast \u2013 Stock Markets Recover on Monday \n-  Target Has Strong Upside Potential; Likely to Log Over 50% Jump in Q4 Profit \n-  GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues Noisy Behavior \n-  GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Gives up Early Gains \n-  Stocks Move Higher At The Start Of The Month \n"}, {"headline": "BTC/USD stagnates under 50,000, ETH/USD sinks under 1,500", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/1.CMBbcF7Ty_T6LdBMUGSg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3163aad28e8c2f2b8cadc514cd079893", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "BTC/USD made a bullish attack at 50,000 early on 2nd March, but it was swiftly curbed by the mark, with the pair finding itself under 48,000 at the end of the day. Buying pressure was still there, but more buying volumes might be required for a pullback above 50,000 to come through.\n\nBTC/USD opened 2nd March at 49,720 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair edged above 50,000 in the first hour but found itself at 49,556 at the hour\u2019s close. An intraday retracement took the pair to 48,354 at 08:00 UTC. Having risen above 49,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC, the pair continued sideways until 16:00, clinging to the 49,000 handle. By 16:00 UTC, a head-and-shoulders-looking pattern had formed and was confirmed with a bearish candlestick between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC that landed on 47,500 and the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nThe moving average did support the price, signaling some lack of confidence of the bears and the presence of buying appetite. The pair continued trending mildly upwards, consistently leaning on the 50-period hourly moving average until 19:00 UTC, but slipped below it at 20:00 UTC.\n\nThe failure of the breakthrough above 50,000, should extend the expectations of an exit out the horizontal channel between 43,000 and 50,000. The update on corporate and institutional holdings from Bitcointreasuries.com on the day showed that the cumulative figure had reached 1.36 million BTC worth around $65 billion at the time. This is an apparent sign of continuing demand for Bitcoin from high-profile investors. Considering their traditional long-term investment fashion, their demand might play a key role in Bitcoin\u2019s financial maturity.\n\nETH/USD spent most of the trading session of 2nd March between 1,540 and 1,580. Selling pressure increased at 16:00 UTC, and the trading pair slipped to under 1,500 in the day\u2019s later hours.\u00a0\n\nETH/USD started 2nd March at 1,572 and produced a sharp spike to 1,600. But the buying volumes were too small, and the pair quickly got back to 1,570, continuing sideways between 1,540 and 1,580 for the most part until 16:00 UTC. Between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, ETH/USD broke down below 1,540 and closed the hour at 1,503.5 based on the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair was consistently heading down afterwards and slipped to 1,460 \u2013 1,480 in the period between 20:00 \u2013 23:00 UTC.\n\nMeanwhile, The Block shows that Ethereum miners set a new record for monthly earnings in February 2021, having earned $1.37 billion during the 28-day-long month. Of those, $772.78 million were transaction fees and $644.4 million were block rewards, which is the first precedent of transaction fees dominating block rewards in Ethereum miners\u2019 revenues on a monthly basis in all of Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nThis shows how much demand is going on for Ethereum as a means of transfer of value, the DeFi market probably being the biggest driver of that demand, as its market capitalisation grew to 71.87 billion, according to CoinGecko, as of 2nd March. Also, the anticipation of the transition of Ethereum to the PoS Beacon Chain is heating up demand for Ether as a means of passive income: according to The Block, the ETH 2.0 deposit contract had 3.33 million ETH on 2nd March.\n\nETH/USD might have found a resting point between 1,460 \u2013 1,570 and may continue sideways on shrinking volatility for a while before taking a turn outside this corridor. The 1,392 daily support level can be a source of resurging buying pressure for ETH/USD in the scenario of a gradual decline.\n"}, {"headline": "Kings of Leon NFT Album: 17 Things to Know as the Rock Album Goes Digital", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/bsE5E5QZ6y_tR2wjagS_8g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/9d4966ecff929dbfd34f5681bdb729ff", "auther": "Vivian Medithi ", "body": "American rock band Kings of Leon have announced their next album will be released as a non-fungible token (NFT) this Friday, just the latest high-profile digital collectible coming to market at a time of skyrocketing interest in cryptoassets.\n\n \n\nHere\u2019s what investors should know about the new album, \u201cNFT Yourself,\u201d coming out Friday, March 5:\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH uptrend to $2,000 in grave danger amid flashing sell signals", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/REIeQHMAYcmTIXjf3ot2qQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bfcbe8c59e51f681a528c61f971e9894", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Ethereum's technical breakout on Monday had a target close to $1,700, but the price recovery failed to overcome the barrier at $1,600. A correction is underway with Ether struggling to hold above $1,500.\n\nEthereum gas fees is exorbitantly high, but the situation has become a norm. Over the last 30 to 60 days, the fee used to make transactions on the network increased significantly. While the gas averages at $12, there are instances where it swells three to four times.\n\nHowever, Santiment's data reveals that a spike in the gas fees usually lasts an average of 30 to 60 minutes. What is intriguing is that the upswings in the gas tend to coincide with Ether's local price bottoms and short-term bounce backs.\n\n\n\nEthereum average fees (21 days)\n\nNote that this finding is not conclusive but gives an insight into the gas fee spikes, which could be triggered by panic selloffs in conjunction with 'paper hand' capitulation. A buy the dip pressure then results in Ethereum's short-term bottom and a pullback.\n\nEther is trading at $1,545 and flirting with the 50 Simple Moving Average (SMA). The breakout from the falling wedge pattern suggested that the liftoff will hit levels close to $1,700. Moreover, a step above the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) could trigger more buy orders as investors anticipate a return to highs above $2,000.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nMeanwhile, failing to hold above the 50 SMA on the 4-hour chart would be a bearish signal. Panic-selling will increase the overhead pressure, forcing Ethereum to explore downhill levels toward $1,200.\n\nNotably, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal in the form of a green nine candlestick. The bearish signal comes at a time when the uptrend is in jeopardy. If validated, the pioneer altcoin will fall in one to four 4-hour candlesticks, adding credibility to the bearish narrative.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe uptrend will be secured if Ethereum manages to hold onto the 50 SMA support on the 4-hour chart. Besides, the falling wedge pattern's impact is still in the picture, and with a small boost, ETH could swing to highs above $1,700. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has a bullish impulse, which could keep buyer interest high.\n"}, {"headline": "Stellar Lumens Is Impressive as a Technology But Not Currently as a Trade", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jDGEk7m07GGEvjcDeE4_KQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/c29b5e8f640f2124ee5501dc12ec92d4", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "As a fundamental fintech innovation, it\u2019s hard not get excited about Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) and its underlying blockchain technology. While we have increasingly become a digitalization-of-everything economy, our payment processing solutions remain curiously archaic. Stellar offers a viable alternative but does that necessarily bode well for its XLM cryptocurrency token?\n\n \n\nI\u2019m going to dive into the nuances of this question. But first, I believe the integration of the Stellar Lumens blockchain technology into mainstream financial institutions should be encouraged. And at some point, you\u2019d figure that this staid industry will be forced to accept that we live in the 21st century.\n\nRecently, I had the displeasure of having to make a wire transfer to another U.S.-based bank. The cost to me was $25 to make the transfer. Additionally, the time it took for the wire transfer to process, along with associated filings was about one week \u2013 that\u2019s an eternity in our supposedly advanced society.\n\nOn the flipside, cryptocurrency transactions occur much quicker and cheaper. Earlier this year, I made several Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) transactions, with the process taking a few hours to complete and with transaction fees in the single-digit dollar range.\n\nHowever, crypto proponents consider Bitcoin as the transactional laggard in this space. Other cryptocurrency transactions, such as through the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) or Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) blockchains occur at lightning-fast speeds and with more modest fees.\n\nAnd this is where Stellar Lumens truly shines. The platform is one of the fastest. Better yet, because of its low flat fees, Stellar opens the door to a viable micropayments economy. In turn, this will help bring the developing part of the world into the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nPlus, we don\u2019t even have to think so globally. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 5.4% or roughly 7.1 million households were unbanked in 2019. Due to the pandemic and the resultant economic crisis, this figure will surely increase.\n\nBefore I go any further into the investment proposition of Stellar Lumens, I need to make a comprehensive disclosure. Yes, I own XLM tokens, but the amount that I have now is a pittance compared to my prior holdings.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m necessarily bearish on XLM. However, when the cryptocurrency market started going sour a little over a week ago, I began taking evasive action. I converted some of my XLM holdings into BTC and some into cold hard cash.\n\nAs I watch the Stellar Lumens token tumble downward \u2013 albeit with a few head fakes here and there \u2013 I\u2019m regretting that I didn\u2019t go all into cash. Oh well. If I\u2019ve learned anything about cryptocurrencies over the years, you just never know where they might end up.\n\nExcept that I did know \u2013 at least, in my own mind. Aside from my own second guessing, the XLM price action looked weak following its trend collapse on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23. Subsequent trades have attempted to push the price back up toward 50 cents, but to no avail.\n\nCan the Stellar Lumens token recover that support level and make its way toward all-time highs? Perhaps, but that will likely depend on Bitcoin. Unfortunately, from where I stand Bitcoin looks like a basket case. Gone is the moxie that took the original virtual currency to the edge of $60,000. Instead, BTC stakeholders should consider themselves fortunate if it doesn\u2019t fall below $40,000.\n\nBelow $40K? Yeah, it can happen (though of course I\u2019m not guaranteeing it) precisely for the same reason why the cryptocurrencies started skyrocketing earlier this year: big institutions are embracing this digital revolution. They\u2019re wonderful to have when they\u2019re driving up the asset. But if these alpha dogs decide to sell, the volatility could be unprecedented.\n\nAs Bitcoin reaches down and cuts into institutional profits, you can rest assured that they\u2019ll dump like mad to preserve their wealth.\n\nThen, you also must factor in human concerns such as tax season and rising bond yields. For the former, Tax Day is approaching, which means profit taking may be in order to help ease the burden imposed by Uncle Sam.\n\nBut the latter case is the most intriguing one for me. The sudden rise in yields not only demonstrates that the incentive to hold risk-on assets is diminishing, it highlights that cryptocurrencies represent the riskiest asset class of them all. It doesn\u2019t pay dividends and it has severe third-party risk in terms of government intervention and/or cyberattacks.\n\nIf the Russians can compromise our most secure assets, then a disruptive attack on the crypto ecosystem seems like child\u2019s play.\n\nFor me, there seems to be too many questions to be comfortable wagering on Stellar Lumens right now. Personally, I\u2019d wait until Bitcoin stabilizes. If not, a low-30-cent/high-20-cent price range wouldn\u2019t be too surprising given the context.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in XLM, BTC, ETH, LTC.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

"auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Some traders assume that Bitcoin\u00a0(CCC:BTC-USD) is the gold standard among cryptocurrencies. There might be merit to that claim, but let\u2019s keep an open mind. Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) also deserves a place in your crypto portfolio \u2014 and you can buy some at a discount, as the price of Ethereum dropped hard recently.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the price is still higher than it was a year ago. Actually, you could say that about the most popular cryptocurrencies in general, since they tend to move together.\n\nSo, why should you invest in Ethereum in particular? As we\u2019ll explore, this digital token could actually exhibit a level of stability that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t.\n\nEstablishing stability is important because cryptocurrency is sometimes considered to be too speculative to take seriously as an investment. Now, let\u2019s start off with a little bit of technical analysis and see if we can detect any noteworthy price patterns.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to consider that around a year ago, during the onset of the novel coronavirus crisis, the Ethereum price actually fell below $100.\n\nIn hindsight, we now know that $100 would have been a terrific buy-up price. We might never see that price again, and prospective ETH owners must now consider whether to buy it in the quadruple digits.\n\nThe price didn\u2019t reach $1,000 in 2020, but Ethereum did achieve that milestone in early January of 2021. And on Feb. 20, the price briefly touched the important $2,000 price point.\n\nBut then, a sharp multi-day pullback happened. On the morning of March 1, the price was slightly above $1,500.\n\nThere didn\u2019t seem to be any Ethereum-specific news that would cause such a sharp price drop.\n\nEvidently, a bout of profit taking occurred within the broader cryptocurrency space, and that seems to have impacted the price of ETH.\n\nIf Bitcoin has a reputation for volatility, then perhaps Ethereum should be known as a more stable cryptocurrency.\n\nIt\u2019s true that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized digital tokens, and that they\u2019re both based on blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, ETH is known for storing smart contracts, which are basically programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAnd, according to researchers Ayana T. Aspembitova, Ling Feng and Lock Yue Chew, that\u2019s not the only thing that sets the currency apart.\n\nIn a journal article titled \u201cBehavioral structure of users in cryptocurrency market,\u201d the researchers observed behavior-based differences between the two most popular cryptocurrencies:\n\n\u201c\u2026 being the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been widely used for speculative purposes\u2026 the behavior of ethereum users is observed to be more stable as these users are more optimistic of the market. In contrast, the behavior of the bitcoin users tend to fluctuate according to the trend of the market, with a loss of optimism when the market goes down.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an outcome which some folks might not have expected. Yet, I must admit that in my observation of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, the latter token does seem to exhibit less price volatility.\n\nAnd here\u2019s some more research to add to your arsenal. As reported by Nairametrics, the number of Ethereum Percent Addresses in a state of profit was recently recorded to be 96.374%.\n\nIn other words, slightly more than 96% of the circulating ETH supply is currently in a state of profit. And, that number represents a one-month low.\n\nSo, even after a major price correction, it\u2019s probably safe to conclude that the majority of Ethereum holders are profitable. I\u2019ll acknowledge that if you chased the price near $2,000, your timing wasn\u2019t necessarily ideal.\n\nYet, there\u2019s hope for a full recovery. You should expect volatility for any cryptocurrency. Thankfully, Ethereum might be less risky than some other coins.\n\nPrice fluctuations will occur, and that\u2019s a normal part of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nIf anything, the price drop in ETH should be viewed as an opportunity. And among the most popular digital tokens, Ethereum could perhaps be a comparatively stable holding.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist,\u00a0TalkMarkets,\u00a0Finom\u00a0Group,\u00a0Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

However, this may prove to be nothing more than a counter-trend correction, as both digital assets bounce off of key support and accelerate higher. \n\nMoreover, the endorsement of the cryptocurrency market by two major investment banks, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, could further validate the digital currency market and intensify capital inflows in the near term. Citigroup\u2019s Global Perspectives and Solutions thinktank stated that Bitcoin could become \u201cthe currency of choice for international trade\u201d, while Goldman plans to offer Bitcoin futures by the middle of this month. \n\nThis comes on the back of Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s statement that it would treat BTC the same as any other financial asset and Mastercard\u2019s commitment to integrate Bitcoin into its payment network. Tesla also announced a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin and plans to begin accepting it as a form of payment. These developments will probably underpin both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the coming weeks and may even result in resumption of the primary uptrends extending from the March 2020 nadirs. Here are the key levels to watch for BTC/USD and ETH/USD.\n\nBitcoin daily chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe formation of a bullish Hammer reversal candle at the 34-EMA (45176), followed by a Bullish Engulfing candle as validation, suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s 7-day correction lower could be at an end. \n\nWith the RSI bursting back above 50, and the MACD tracking firmly above its neutral midpoint, the path of least resistance seems skewed to topside. \n\nA daily close back above psychological resistance at 50,000 would probably intensify near-term buying pressure and generate an impulsive push to retest the yearly high (58,321). Hurdling that brings the 61.8% Fibonacci (61298) and 65,000 mark into the crosshairs.\n\nHowever, if 50,000 holds firm, a more extended pullback to former resistance-turned-support at the January high (41969) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 69.56% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.28 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.46% lower than yesterday and 25.31% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 12.22% lower than yesterday and 28.40% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Bitcoin prices may continue to fall.\n\nTraders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger Bitcoin-bearish contrarian trading bias.\n\nEthereum daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nEthereum also looks set to climb higher in the coming days, as prices surge away from confluent support at the trend-defining 55-EMA and 2018 high (1424). \n\nGaining a firm foothold back above psychological resistance at 1600 would likely pave the way for buyers to retest the yearly high (2036). A daily close above is ultimately needed to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and bring the 100% Fibonacci (2410) into focus. \n\nAlternatively, a daily close below range support at 1400 \u2013 1440 could encourage would-be sellers and result in a pullback to mobile support at the 100-MA (1108). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 86.84% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 6.60 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.39% lower than yesterday and 24.39% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 16.22% lower than yesterday and 21.72% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Ethereum prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed Ethereum trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin (BTC/USD), Ethereum (ETH/USD) Rallying Sharply as the Bulls Wrestle Back Control", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/N8NkPHuyCUNK.Mw1v5Swtg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/ed541f1965e6c7bb14b43c8cfe11bed2", "auther": "Nick Cawley", "body": "A sea of green in the cryptocurrency space with some coins recording early double-digit gains. Last week\u2019s sell-off has been absorbed and the technical picture for both Bitcoin and Ethereum now looks increasingly positive. As always with the cryptocurrency, the real reason for the move is never immediately clear although a few recent actions are likely to be put forward as drivers of the recent move. A recent tweet by the CEO of a South Korean crypto-analytics firm that the large Bitcoin trades recently indicate OTC-buying by cryptocurrency \u2018whales\u2019 will have buoyed the bulls, while Goldman Sachs is said to be firing up its cryptocurrency trading desk again and will begin trading bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards. In addition, cryptocurrency miner, publicly-quoted Argo Blockchain, today said that it will pay its CEO in Bitcoin and allow other employees to be in Bitcoin if they wish.\n\nWhile in isolation these events may not spark a strong move, in combination they continue to point to increased adoption and interest in the space, a space that needs little news to spark a strong move. Emotion is a strong driver in the cryptocurrency market and if the recent move has taken out selling interest, then a fresh move higher looks the path of least resistance.\n\nHow to Manage the Emotions of Trading\n\nA look at the daily charts suggests that the recent sell-off is being pared back and if BTC/USD can regain its bullish channel, fresh all-time highs are likely.The CCI reading shows Bitcoin landed in oversold territory recently for the first time since late-January, with the previous oversold reading back in September 2020 when BTC traded around $10,000. It looks as though oversold signals have been drivers of strong rallies. The bullish channel is steep and BTC/USD will likely have to make a fresh all-time high to regain it.\n\nEthereum (ETH/USD) continues its pullback from the late-February sell-off and is looking to re-test $1,700 and potentially higher. Again the CCI indicator highlighted heavily oversold conditions, while the 50-day simple moving average helped to stem the sell-off and if closed and opened above will turn into stronger support. The next area of resistance lies between $1,700 and $1,780 before the February 20 high of $2,036 comes into play.\n\nTraders of all levels and abilities will find something to help them make more informed decisions in the new and improved DailyFX Trading Education Centre\n\nWhat are your views on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 bullish or bearish??

Back then, cryptocurrencies tumbled a combined 81%, wiping out almost $600 billion in market capitalization and sending Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and other altcoins on a multi-year recovery journey few want to relive.\n\nThis time however, looks slightly different. Bitcoin has far wider adoption, particularly among payment processors like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ). And high-profile thefts have also become rarer as security has improved. That makes Bitcoin far more likely to stay relevant, even as prices gyrate.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s stability comes at the expense of more limited upside. The cryptocurrency\u2019s $800 billion market cap already makes it the fifth-largest currency in the world. A doubling would make it as large as the U.S. Dollar, while 10x growth would make it more valuable than all the physical gold ever mined.\n\nThat means investors looking for the next 100x cryptocurrency need to look at altcoins \u2014 smaller cryptocurrencies that still have a chance of making it big. Because when you\u2019re buying a currency worth $10 billion, there\u2019s a far better chance of considerable gains ahead.\n\nBitcoin itself is a technological dinosaur relative to other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain transactions, for instance, cost $15 to perform and takes ten minutes to confirm.\n\nBut as the first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has maintained its lead thanks to a strong community and widespread adoption. That means successful altcoins will need far more than minor technological improvements. Bitcoin Cash, for instance, remains 80% beneath its all-time highs despite having a higher transaction per second limit than its predecessor.\n\nInstead, successful altcoins will look much more like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), a long-time favorite altcoin:\n\nAltcoins aren\u2019t necessarily for everyone. Even the most promising will stumble if programming flaws emerge \u2014 and significant initial coin offerings (ICOs) are often notoriously overpriced, leading to long-term underperformance.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s shadow will still loom over the crypto landscape, here are five promising altcoins every investor should know:\n\nAltcoins that gain scale could pose a threat to Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. The legacy cryptocurrency still relies on third parties to batch orders and act as a middleman to overcome Bitcoin\u2019s cost and lack of speed. The next generation of coins promises to perform these tasks independently. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n \n\nCardano remains one of the most advanced general-use altcoins on the market. This third-generation coin uses a proof-of-stake system, compared with the standard proof-of-work. That makes the system far more efficient than Bitcoin and faster as well.\n\nThe Cardano Foundation also has an all-star team running the show. The currency was started in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, and retains an active development community. Today, the team is led by digital payments veteran Frederik Gregaard, an old hand who once led PwC\u2019s Digital Financial Services division.\n\nADA, the currency run on the Cardano Network, has already advanced 4,400% since its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. As the currency gains greater exposure, investors ae now seeing price targets of $10 start appearing \u2014 significant upside for a coin available for less than $1 today.\n\n \n\nPolkadot was founded by another alum of the Ethereum Project \u2014 Chief Technology Officer Gavin Wood. And this altcoin takes an entirely different approach to cryptocurrencies.\n\nRather than host a single ever-growing blockchain, Polkadot uses parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that run in parallel. That solves Bitcoin\u2019s problem of managing a single ledger \u2014 one that\u2019s already over 320 GB in size.\n\nThe altcoin has seen spectacular growth since its August 2020 launch through efforts like Polkastarter, a decentralized exchange built on Polkadot. Projects have even started attracting attention from Gemini crypto exchange founders the Winklevoss twins, as well as many high-profile sports celebrities.\n\nThat makes DOT, the currency on Polkadot, one to watch closely for 2021. The currency has already grown tenfold. But with a $30 billion market cap, there\u2019s still room for this promising altcoin to run.\n\n \n\nRipple (CCC:XRP-USD) co-founder Jed McCaleb started Stellar in 2014 as an altcoin alternative to XRP. The cryptocurrency facilitates cross-border transactions by using a protocol developed by Stanford professor David Mazi\u00e8res.\n\nThe system itself uses a trusted network, where each person running the software identifies other trusted partners to confirm transactions. That removes the need for the expensive cryptographic mining Bitcoin relies on to validate transactions.\n\nStellar\u2019s fundamental reason for growth however, has more to do with rival XRP\u2019s fall. In December, the SEC charged Ripple and two executives with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering. Around half of all XRP is still owned by founding company Ripple Networks, and its ICOs triggered regulatory red flags.\n\nMeanwhile Stellar has stepped in to fill XRP\u2019s role. Its system of using trusted partners makes it an ideal replacement for quickly moving money between banks. And with a coin price less than $0.40, Stellar is a currency that could still grow many times over.\n\n \n\nCelsius is a smaller cryptocurrency focused on lending and borrowing. Interest rates for would-be borrowers start at just 1% APR, while depositors earn interest on cryptocurrency that would otherwise sit in a stagnant account. Interest rates can rise as high as 15.85% for stablecoins like Tether.\n\nCelsius Network has also wisely registered as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2018, making it far less likely to run into regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe system looks particularly promising thanks to its ease of use. Savers can transfer their entire cryptocurrency account to Celsius Network \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum and all \u2014 without converting to any proprietary coin. And borrowers can take out loans by depositing cryptocurrency, avoiding the need to cash out.\n\nThere are risks of course. An investigation by Coindesk found instances of uncollateralized lending by the network, where a borrower default would leave either Celsius Networks or P2P lenders with irreversible losses. And there\u2019s always a temptation to make riskier loans that earn higher interest payments.\n\nA sudden drop in collateral values (i.e., cryptocurrencies) can also have a knock-on effect to Celsius\u2019 value. As of writing, Celsius requires a 2.7 ETH deposit to borrow $1,000. At today\u2019s crypto prices, a borrower should willingly repay the loan to retrieve their collateral. If ETH prices plummet however, the same person might instead decide to walk away with the money, leaving Celsius investors hoping that the Network hedged its bets.\n\nNevertheless, Celsius shows a great deal of promise. CEL is highly differentiated from Bitcoin, and investment risks will decline as cryptocurrency prices eventually stabilize.\n\n \n\nInvestors might have written off Neo long ago. The China-based cryptocurrency (formerly known as Antshares) went into a tailspin back in 2018 when the Chinese Central Government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. The currency remains almost 80% down from its all-time highs.\n\nYet change is on the horizon. In April last year, the Chinese authorities began a limited rollout of e-yuan, a government-backed cryptocurrency. People expect the CCP to expand the program during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nMuch of this change comes from a recognition that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. And rather than allow outside players like Bitcoin and Ethereum to push finance out of the CCP\u2019s sight, they have started embracing home-grown cryptocurrencies as alternatives.\n\nSmaller Chinese-based cryptocurrencies have already started emerging. VeChain, another promising cryptocurrency, helps Chinese companies with supply-chain management.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to know if the CCP will also anoint Neo a cryptocurrency champion, there\u2019s phenomenal upside to be had if they do.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin\u2019s Nosedive below $45,000 Can Open Way to Continued Correction, Ethereum\u2019s Repeats after...", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/_vAsLCzb6bVpoG_f0ZCrrg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/b76915b30c62f709fbe1d1291f267707", "auther": "Anissimov Konstantin", "body": "BTC/USD started the week at 57,499 near the all-time high at 58,400, based on the CEX.IOpricing.

The level produced some buying pressure for the pair but only for the next four hours, as BTC/USD closed the 4-hour candlestick between 04:00 and 08:00 UTC at 46,479.\n\nThat, however, made no lasting influence, and BTC/USD had broken down below 56,000 and dropped below 53,500 by 16:00 UTC.

The pair was edging sideways within the corridor of 45,000 \u2013 49,000 until 01:00 UTC of Wednesday, 24th February. At that time a rebound above 49,000 started to take place and continued until 05:00 UTC, with 51,000 topped out.\n\nThe volatility reduced considerably, as the pair continued edging sideways within the price range of 50,000 \u2013 51,000. At 13:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, a drawdown to 49,000 happened; afterwards, BTC/USD continued between 48,000 \u2013 50,000 until the end of Wednesday. The sideways fluctuations continued on Thursday, 25th February, until 12:00 UTC. At 12:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, BTC/USD bounced to 52,000. Afterwards, BTC/USD began another continued downfall, which continued to 45,000 on Friday, 26th February. The falling stopped at 08:00 UTC, as the zone offered a buying opportunity.\n\nBTC/USD had bounced to 48,265 by 17:00 UTC and then reversed downwards until 23:00 UTC, almost reaching 45,000, and closed Friday at 45,447. On Saturday, 27th February, BTC/USD the bulls continued supporting the trading pair with buying volumes, and BTC/USD briefly rose to 48,100 between 0200 \u2013 02:45 UTC. The pair continued sideways until 07:00 UTC, once breaking above the 50-period hourly SMA, but was eventually driven down below 47,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC. The upside attempts at the SMA continued unsuccessfully until the end of Saturday. On Sunday, 28th February, selling pressure increased and saw BTC/USD gradually head down to 43,067 at its lowest. The capitalisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was an indication of continuing selling bias in the trading pair.\n\nThere was some news in the week of 22nd February that kept up Bitcoin bulls\u2019 hopes of an upside recovery. Square, Inc. that had invested $50,000 million in Bitcoin in October 2020 made another Bitcoin purchase worth $170 million on 24th February 2021. Besides that, MicroStrategy \u2013 the corporate frontrunner among Bitcoin investors \u2013 bought 19,452 more BTC worth $1.026 billion at an average price of $52,765. This new purchase had brought MicroStrategy\u2019s exposure to Bitcoin to 90,531 BTC.\n\nThese tendencies clearly showed that high profile investors were happy with the Bitcoin drawdown and were ready to buy the dip. This shows that Bitcoin continues to be looked upon as a solid financial instrument, and every downside correction is going to be met with substantial buying volumes.\n\nThe decline to nearly 43,000 and a stabilisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was a signal of continuing bearish bias in BTC/USD, promising lower lows. Still, some bullish momentum remains to be present, and a breakthrough above 48,000 and above the 50-period 4-hour SMA would signal a change of bias and an upside recovery gaining traction. On the contrary, another decline to 43,000 will mean a continuation of bearish price action, with prospects of getting back to testing the 31,000 support level.\n\nTherefore, we shall soon get answers on where BTC/USD will go next. With the pair edging higher towards 48,000 in the morning hours of Monday, the odds for a breakthrough are presently going higher.\n\nETH/USD opened the week of 22nd February at 1,933.4 and headed straight down from the start of the day, briefly getting below the 50-period 4-hour SMA with the lower wick of Monday\u2019s first 4-hour candlestick reaching 1,867.3. The SMA gave ETH/USD some transitory support, but it continued sinking lower until 09:00 UTC on Tuesday, 23rd February, with support being found at 1,440. The trading pair continued sideways until the end of Tuesday, fluctuating within a considerable range of 1,360 and 1,600.\n\nFrom the start of Wednesday, 24th February, the ETH/USD trading pair headed upwards to reach 1,715 and break above the 50-period hourly SMA. The volatility shrank considerably, as ETH/USD spent most of the time until 18:00 UTC on Thursday, 25th February within the range of 1,586.4 \u2013 1,662, being regularly supported by the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nETH/USD, ETH/USD headed down from 18:00 UTC on Thursday through to 08:00 UTC on Friday, 26th February. The pair eventually hit 1,402 at the minimum and continued edging sideways between 1,424.7 and 1,560 until the end of Saturday, 27th February, with the 50-period hourly SMA upkeeping the ETH/USD bearish momentum.\n\nAnother downswing took place on Sunday, 28th February, with a minimum at 1,299.6. However, an upside recovery that began at 19:00 UTC and continued through to the end of Sunday, with the 1,392.2 support level letting ETH/USD close the week at 1,417.5 as per the CEX.IO pricing. On top of that, ETH/USD finished Sunday in a hammer candlestick on the daily timeframe, which coupled with the 1,420 support level gives increased potential for a full-fledged upside recovery in the near term.\n\nIt became known that the intraday pullback in ETH/USD between Tuesday, 23rd February, and Wednesday, 24th February, from the mid-to-lower 1,400s to above 1,700 coincided with a purchase of 10,000 ETH by Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which brought its Ether exposure to 3.17 ETH.\n\nThe bullish market reaction to the purchase clearly shows that big players\u2019 moves have a strong impact on the Ethereum market. And the purchase itself shows that high-profile investors, who constitute most of Grayscale clients, have trust in Ethereum in the long term, which can result in continued market growth for the smart-contract pioneer.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Continues to Show Strength \n-  S&P 500 Price Forecast \u2013 Stock Markets Recover on Monday \n-  Target Has Strong Upside Potential; Likely to Log Over 50% Jump in Q4 Profit \n-  GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues Noisy Behavior \n-  GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Gives up Early Gains \n-  Stocks Move Higher At The Start Of The Month \n"}, {"headline": "BTC/USD stagnates under 50,000, ETH/USD sinks under 1,500", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/1.CMBbcF7Ty_T6LdBMUGSg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3163aad28e8c2f2b8cadc514cd079893", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "BTC/USD made a bullish attack at 50,000 early on 2nd March, but it was swiftly curbed by the mark, with the pair finding itself under 48,000 at the end of the day. Buying pressure was still there, but more buying volumes might be required for a pullback above 50,000 to come through.\n\nBTC/USD opened 2nd March at 49,720 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair edged above 50,000 in the first hour but found itself at 49,556 at the hour\u2019s close. An intraday retracement took the pair to 48,354 at 08:00 UTC. Having risen above 49,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC, the pair continued sideways until 16:00, clinging to the 49,000 handle. By 16:00 UTC, a head-and-shoulders-looking pattern had formed and was confirmed with a bearish candlestick between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC that landed on 47,500 and the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nThe moving average did support the price, signaling some lack of confidence of the bears and the presence of buying appetite. The pair continued trending mildly upwards, consistently leaning on the 50-period hourly moving average until 19:00 UTC, but slipped below it at 20:00 UTC.\n\nThe failure of the breakthrough above 50,000, should extend the expectations of an exit out the horizontal channel between 43,000 and 50,000. The update on corporate and institutional holdings from Bitcointreasuries.com on the day showed that the cumulative figure had reached 1.36 million BTC worth around $65 billion at the time. This is an apparent sign of continuing demand for Bitcoin from high-profile investors. Considering their traditional long-term investment fashion, their demand might play a key role in Bitcoin\u2019s financial maturity.\n\nETH/USD spent most of the trading session of 2nd March between 1,540 and 1,580. Selling pressure increased at 16:00 UTC, and the trading pair slipped to under 1,500 in the day\u2019s later hours.\u00a0\n\nETH/USD started 2nd March at 1,572 and produced a sharp spike to 1,600. But the buying volumes were too small, and the pair quickly got back to 1,570, continuing sideways between 1,540 and 1,580 for the most part until 16:00 UTC. Between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, ETH/USD broke down below 1,540 and closed the hour at 1,503.5 based on the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair was consistently heading down afterwards and slipped to 1,460 \u2013 1,480 in the period between 20:00 \u2013 23:00 UTC.\n\nMeanwhile, The Block shows that Ethereum miners set a new record for monthly earnings in February 2021, having earned $1.37 billion during the 28-day-long month. Of those, $772.78 million were transaction fees and $644.4 million were block rewards, which is the first precedent of transaction fees dominating block rewards in Ethereum miners\u2019 revenues on a monthly basis in all of Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nThis shows how much demand is going on for Ethereum as a means of transfer of value, the DeFi market probably being the biggest driver of that demand, as its market capitalisation grew to 71.87 billion, according to CoinGecko, as of 2nd March. Also, the anticipation of the transition of Ethereum to the PoS Beacon Chain is heating up demand for Ether as a means of passive income: according to The Block, the ETH 2.0 deposit contract had 3.33 million ETH on 2nd March.\n\nETH/USD might have found a resting point between 1,460 \u2013 1,570 and may continue sideways on shrinking volatility for a while before taking a turn outside this corridor. The 1,392 daily support level can be a source of resurging buying pressure for ETH/USD in the scenario of a gradual decline.\n"}, {"headline": "Kings of Leon NFT Album: 17 Things to Know as the Rock Album Goes Digital", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/bsE5E5QZ6y_tR2wjagS_8g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/9d4966ecff929dbfd34f5681bdb729ff", "auther": "Vivian Medithi ", "body": "American rock band Kings of Leon have announced their next album will be released as a non-fungible token (NFT) this Friday, just the latest high-profile digital collectible coming to market at a time of skyrocketing interest in cryptoassets.\n\n \n\nHere\u2019s what investors should know about the new album, \u201cNFT Yourself,\u201d coming out Friday, March 5:\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH uptrend to $2,000 in grave danger amid flashing sell signals", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/REIeQHMAYcmTIXjf3ot2qQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bfcbe8c59e51f681a528c61f971e9894", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Ethereum's technical breakout on Monday had a target close to $1,700, but the price recovery failed to overcome the barrier at $1,600. A correction is underway with Ether struggling to hold above $1,500.\n\nEthereum gas fees is exorbitantly high, but the situation has become a norm. Over the last 30 to 60 days, the fee used to make transactions on the network increased significantly. While the gas averages at $12, there are instances where it swells three to four times.\n\nHowever, Santiment's data reveals that a spike in the gas fees usually lasts an average of 30 to 60 minutes. What is intriguing is that the upswings in the gas tend to coincide with Ether's local price bottoms and short-term bounce backs.\n\n\n\nEthereum average fees (21 days)\n\nNote that this finding is not conclusive but gives an insight into the gas fee spikes, which could be triggered by panic selloffs in conjunction with 'paper hand' capitulation. A buy the dip pressure then results in Ethereum's short-term bottom and a pullback.\n\nEther is trading at $1,545 and flirting with the 50 Simple Moving Average (SMA). The breakout from the falling wedge pattern suggested that the liftoff will hit levels close to $1,700. Moreover, a step above the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) could trigger more buy orders as investors anticipate a return to highs above $2,000.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nMeanwhile, failing to hold above the 50 SMA on the 4-hour chart would be a bearish signal. Panic-selling will increase the overhead pressure, forcing Ethereum to explore downhill levels toward $1,200.\n\nNotably, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal in the form of a green nine candlestick. The bearish signal comes at a time when the uptrend is in jeopardy. If validated, the pioneer altcoin will fall in one to four 4-hour candlesticks, adding credibility to the bearish narrative.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe uptrend will be secured if Ethereum manages to hold onto the 50 SMA support on the 4-hour chart. Besides, the falling wedge pattern's impact is still in the picture, and with a small boost, ETH could swing to highs above $1,700. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has a bullish impulse, which could keep buyer interest high.\n"}, {"headline": "Stellar Lumens Is Impressive as a Technology But Not Currently as a Trade", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jDGEk7m07GGEvjcDeE4_KQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/c29b5e8f640f2124ee5501dc12ec92d4", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "As a fundamental fintech innovation, it\u2019s hard not get excited about Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) and its underlying blockchain technology. While we have increasingly become a digitalization-of-everything economy, our payment processing solutions remain curiously archaic. Stellar offers a viable alternative but does that necessarily bode well for its XLM cryptocurrency token?\n\n \n\nI\u2019m going to dive into the nuances of this question. But first, I believe the integration of the Stellar Lumens blockchain technology into mainstream financial institutions should be encouraged. And at some point, you\u2019d figure that this staid industry will be forced to accept that we live in the 21st century.\n\nRecently, I had the displeasure of having to make a wire transfer to another U.S.-based bank. The cost to me was $25 to make the transfer. Additionally, the time it took for the wire transfer to process, along with associated filings was about one week \u2013 that\u2019s an eternity in our supposedly advanced society.\n\nOn the flipside, cryptocurrency transactions occur much quicker and cheaper. Earlier this year, I made several Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) transactions, with the process taking a few hours to complete and with transaction fees in the single-digit dollar range.\n\nHowever, crypto proponents consider Bitcoin as the transactional laggard in this space. Other cryptocurrency transactions, such as through the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) or Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) blockchains occur at lightning-fast speeds and with more modest fees.\n\nAnd this is where Stellar Lumens truly shines. The platform is one of the fastest. Better yet, because of its low flat fees, Stellar opens the door to a viable micropayments economy. In turn, this will help bring the developing part of the world into the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nPlus, we don\u2019t even have to think so globally. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 5.4% or roughly 7.1 million households were unbanked in 2019. Due to the pandemic and the resultant economic crisis, this figure will surely increase.\n\nBefore I go any further into the investment proposition of Stellar Lumens, I need to make a comprehensive disclosure. Yes, I own XLM tokens, but the amount that I have now is a pittance compared to my prior holdings.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m necessarily bearish on XLM. However, when the cryptocurrency market started going sour a little over a week ago, I began taking evasive action. I converted some of my XLM holdings into BTC and some into cold hard cash.\n\nAs I watch the Stellar Lumens token tumble downward \u2013 albeit with a few head fakes here and there \u2013 I\u2019m regretting that I didn\u2019t go all into cash. Oh well. If I\u2019ve learned anything about cryptocurrencies over the years, you just never know where they might end up.\n\nExcept that I did know \u2013 at least, in my own mind. Aside from my own second guessing, the XLM price action looked weak following its trend collapse on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23. Subsequent trades have attempted to push the price back up toward 50 cents, but to no avail.\n\nCan the Stellar Lumens token recover that support level and make its way toward all-time highs? Perhaps, but that will likely depend on Bitcoin. Unfortunately, from where I stand Bitcoin looks like a basket case. Gone is the moxie that took the original virtual currency to the edge of $60,000. Instead, BTC stakeholders should consider themselves fortunate if it doesn\u2019t fall below $40,000.\n\nBelow $40K? Yeah, it can happen (though of course I\u2019m not guaranteeing it) precisely for the same reason why the cryptocurrencies started skyrocketing earlier this year: big institutions are embracing this digital revolution. They\u2019re wonderful to have when they\u2019re driving up the asset. But if these alpha dogs decide to sell, the volatility could be unprecedented.\n\nAs Bitcoin reaches down and cuts into institutional profits, you can rest assured that they\u2019ll dump like mad to preserve their wealth.\n\nThen, you also must factor in human concerns such as tax season and rising bond yields. For the former, Tax Day is approaching, which means profit taking may be in order to help ease the burden imposed by Uncle Sam.\n\nBut the latter case is the most intriguing one for me. The sudden rise in yields not only demonstrates that the incentive to hold risk-on assets is diminishing, it highlights that cryptocurrencies represent the riskiest asset class of them all. It doesn\u2019t pay dividends and it has severe third-party risk in terms of government intervention and/or cyberattacks.\n\nIf the Russians can compromise our most secure assets, then a disruptive attack on the crypto ecosystem seems like child\u2019s play.\n\nFor me, there seems to be too many questions to be comfortable wagering on Stellar Lumens right now. Personally, I\u2019d wait until Bitcoin stabilizes. If not, a low-30-cent/high-20-cent price range wouldn\u2019t be too surprising given the context.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in XLM, BTC, ETH, LTC.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

"auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Some traders assume that Bitcoin\u00a0(CCC:BTC-USD) is the gold standard among cryptocurrencies. There might be merit to that claim, but let\u2019s keep an open mind. Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) also deserves a place in your crypto portfolio \u2014 and you can buy some at a discount, as the price of Ethereum dropped hard recently.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the price is still higher than it was a year ago. Actually, you could say that about the most popular cryptocurrencies in general, since they tend to move together.\n\nSo, why should you invest in Ethereum in particular? As we\u2019ll explore, this digital token could actually exhibit a level of stability that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t.\n\nEstablishing stability is important because cryptocurrency is sometimes considered to be too speculative to take seriously as an investment. Now, let\u2019s start off with a little bit of technical analysis and see if we can detect any noteworthy price patterns.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to consider that around a year ago, during the onset of the novel coronavirus crisis, the Ethereum price actually fell below $100.\n\nIn hindsight, we now know that $100 would have been a terrific buy-up price. We might never see that price again, and prospective ETH owners must now consider whether to buy it in the quadruple digits.\n\nThe price didn\u2019t reach $1,000 in 2020, but Ethereum did achieve that milestone in early January of 2021. And on Feb. 20, the price briefly touched the important $2,000 price point.\n\nBut then, a sharp multi-day pullback happened. On the morning of March 1, the price was slightly above $1,500.\n\nThere didn\u2019t seem to be any Ethereum-specific news that would cause such a sharp price drop.\n\nEvidently, a bout of profit taking occurred within the broader cryptocurrency space, and that seems to have impacted the price of ETH.\n\nIf Bitcoin has a reputation for volatility, then perhaps Ethereum should be known as a more stable cryptocurrency.\n\nIt\u2019s true that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized digital tokens, and that they\u2019re both based on blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, ETH is known for storing smart contracts, which are basically programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAnd, according to researchers Ayana T. Aspembitova, Ling Feng and Lock Yue Chew, that\u2019s not the only thing that sets the currency apart.\n\nIn a journal article titled \u201cBehavioral structure of users in cryptocurrency market,\u201d the researchers observed behavior-based differences between the two most popular cryptocurrencies:\n\n\u201c\u2026 being the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been widely used for speculative purposes\u2026 the behavior of ethereum users is observed to be more stable as these users are more optimistic of the market. In contrast, the behavior of the bitcoin users tend to fluctuate according to the trend of the market, with a loss of optimism when the market goes down.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an outcome which some folks might not have expected. Yet, I must admit that in my observation of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, the latter token does seem to exhibit less price volatility.\n\nAnd here\u2019s some more research to add to your arsenal. As reported by Nairametrics, the number of Ethereum Percent Addresses in a state of profit was recently recorded to be 96.374%.\n\nIn other words, slightly more than 96% of the circulating ETH supply is currently in a state of profit. And, that number represents a one-month low.\n\nSo, even after a major price correction, it\u2019s probably safe to conclude that the majority of Ethereum holders are profitable. I\u2019ll acknowledge that if you chased the price near $2,000, your timing wasn\u2019t necessarily ideal.\n\nYet, there\u2019s hope for a full recovery. You should expect volatility for any cryptocurrency. Thankfully, Ethereum might be less risky than some other coins.\n\nPrice fluctuations will occur, and that\u2019s a normal part of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nIf anything, the price drop in ETH should be viewed as an opportunity. And among the most popular digital tokens, Ethereum could perhaps be a comparatively stable holding.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist,\u00a0TalkMarkets,\u00a0Finom\u00a0Group,\u00a0Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

However, this may prove to be nothing more than a counter-trend correction, as both digital assets bounce off of key support and accelerate higher. \n\nMoreover, the endorsement of the cryptocurrency market by two major investment banks, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, could further validate the digital currency market and intensify capital inflows in the near term. Citigroup\u2019s Global Perspectives and Solutions thinktank stated that Bitcoin could become \u201cthe currency of choice for international trade\u201d, while Goldman plans to offer Bitcoin futures by the middle of this month. \n\nThis comes on the back of Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s statement that it would treat BTC the same as any other financial asset and Mastercard\u2019s commitment to integrate Bitcoin into its payment network. Tesla also announced a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin and plans to begin accepting it as a form of payment. These developments will probably underpin both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the coming weeks and may even result in resumption of the primary uptrends extending from the March 2020 nadirs. Here are the key levels to watch for BTC/USD and ETH/USD.\n\nBitcoin daily chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe formation of a bullish Hammer reversal candle at the 34-EMA (45176), followed by a Bullish Engulfing candle as validation, suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s 7-day correction lower could be at an end. \n\nWith the RSI bursting back above 50, and the MACD tracking firmly above its neutral midpoint, the path of least resistance seems skewed to topside. \n\nA daily close back above psychological resistance at 50,000 would probably intensify near-term buying pressure and generate an impulsive push to retest the yearly high (58,321). Hurdling that brings the 61.8% Fibonacci (61298) and 65,000 mark into the crosshairs.\n\nHowever, if 50,000 holds firm, a more extended pullback to former resistance-turned-support at the January high (41969) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 69.56% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.28 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.46% lower than yesterday and 25.31% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 12.22% lower than yesterday and 28.40% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Bitcoin prices may continue to fall.\n\nTraders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger Bitcoin-bearish contrarian trading bias.\n\nEthereum daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nEthereum also looks set to climb higher in the coming days, as prices surge away from confluent support at the trend-defining 55-EMA and 2018 high (1424). \n\nGaining a firm foothold back above psychological resistance at 1600 would likely pave the way for buyers to retest the yearly high (2036). A daily close above is ultimately needed to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and bring the 100% Fibonacci (2410) into focus. \n\nAlternatively, a daily close below range support at 1400 \u2013 1440 could encourage would-be sellers and result in a pullback to mobile support at the 100-MA (1108). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 86.84% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 6.60 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.39% lower than yesterday and 24.39% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 16.22% lower than yesterday and 21.72% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Ethereum prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed Ethereum trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin (BTC/USD), Ethereum (ETH/USD) Rallying Sharply as the Bulls Wrestle Back Control", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/N8NkPHuyCUNK.Mw1v5Swtg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/ed541f1965e6c7bb14b43c8cfe11bed2", "auther": "Nick Cawley", "body": "A sea of green in the cryptocurrency space with some coins recording early double-digit gains. Last week\u2019s sell-off has been absorbed and the technical picture for both Bitcoin and Ethereum now looks increasingly positive. As always with the cryptocurrency, the real reason for the move is never immediately clear although a few recent actions are likely to be put forward as drivers of the recent move. A recent tweet by the CEO of a South Korean crypto-analytics firm that the large Bitcoin trades recently indicate OTC-buying by cryptocurrency \u2018whales\u2019 will have buoyed the bulls, while Goldman Sachs is said to be firing up its cryptocurrency trading desk again and will begin trading bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards. In addition, cryptocurrency miner, publicly-quoted Argo Blockchain, today said that it will pay its CEO in Bitcoin and allow other employees to be in Bitcoin if they wish.\n\nWhile in isolation these events may not spark a strong move, in combination they continue to point to increased adoption and interest in the space, a space that needs little news to spark a strong move. Emotion is a strong driver in the cryptocurrency market and if the recent move has taken out selling interest, then a fresh move higher looks the path of least resistance.\n\nHow to Manage the Emotions of Trading\n\nA look at the daily charts suggests that the recent sell-off is being pared back and if BTC/USD can regain its bullish channel, fresh all-time highs are likely.The CCI reading shows Bitcoin landed in oversold territory recently for the first time since late-January, with the previous oversold reading back in September 2020 when BTC traded around $10,000. It looks as though oversold signals have been drivers of strong rallies. The bullish channel is steep and BTC/USD will likely have to make a fresh all-time high to regain it.\n\nEthereum (ETH/USD) continues its pullback from the late-February sell-off and is looking to re-test $1,700 and potentially higher. Again the CCI indicator highlighted heavily oversold conditions, while the 50-day simple moving average helped to stem the sell-off and if closed and opened above will turn into stronger support. The next area of resistance lies between $1,700 and $1,780 before the February 20 high of $2,036 comes into play.\n\nTraders of all levels and abilities will find something to help them make more informed decisions in the new and improved DailyFX Trading Education Centre\n\nWhat are your views on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 bullish or bearish??

Back then, cryptocurrencies tumbled a combined 81%, wiping out almost $600 billion in market capitalization and sending Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and other altcoins on a multi-year recovery journey few want to relive.\n\nThis time however, looks slightly different. Bitcoin has far wider adoption, particularly among payment processors like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ). And high-profile thefts have also become rarer as security has improved. That makes Bitcoin far more likely to stay relevant, even as prices gyrate.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s stability comes at the expense of more limited upside. The cryptocurrency\u2019s $800 billion market cap already makes it the fifth-largest currency in the world. A doubling would make it as large as the U.S. Dollar, while 10x growth would make it more valuable than all the physical gold ever mined.\n\nThat means investors looking for the next 100x cryptocurrency need to look at altcoins \u2014 smaller cryptocurrencies that still have a chance of making it big. Because when you\u2019re buying a currency worth $10 billion, there\u2019s a far better chance of considerable gains ahead.\n\nBitcoin itself is a technological dinosaur relative to other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain transactions, for instance, cost $15 to perform and takes ten minutes to confirm.\n\nBut as the first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has maintained its lead thanks to a strong community and widespread adoption. That means successful altcoins will need far more than minor technological improvements. Bitcoin Cash, for instance, remains 80% beneath its all-time highs despite having a higher transaction per second limit than its predecessor.\n\nInstead, successful altcoins will look much more like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), a long-time favorite altcoin:\n\nAltcoins aren\u2019t necessarily for everyone. Even the most promising will stumble if programming flaws emerge \u2014 and significant initial coin offerings (ICOs) are often notoriously overpriced, leading to long-term underperformance.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s shadow will still loom over the crypto landscape, here are five promising altcoins every investor should know:\n\nAltcoins that gain scale could pose a threat to Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. The legacy cryptocurrency still relies on third parties to batch orders and act as a middleman to overcome Bitcoin\u2019s cost and lack of speed. The next generation of coins promises to perform these tasks independently. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n \n\nCardano remains one of the most advanced general-use altcoins on the market. This third-generation coin uses a proof-of-stake system, compared with the standard proof-of-work. That makes the system far more efficient than Bitcoin and faster as well.\n\nThe Cardano Foundation also has an all-star team running the show. The currency was started in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, and retains an active development community. Today, the team is led by digital payments veteran Frederik Gregaard, an old hand who once led PwC\u2019s Digital Financial Services division.\n\nADA, the currency run on the Cardano Network, has already advanced 4,400% since its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. As the currency gains greater exposure, investors ae now seeing price targets of $10 start appearing \u2014 significant upside for a coin available for less than $1 today.\n\n \n\nPolkadot was founded by another alum of the Ethereum Project \u2014 Chief Technology Officer Gavin Wood. And this altcoin takes an entirely different approach to cryptocurrencies.\n\nRather than host a single ever-growing blockchain, Polkadot uses parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that run in parallel. That solves Bitcoin\u2019s problem of managing a single ledger \u2014 one that\u2019s already over 320 GB in size.\n\nThe altcoin has seen spectacular growth since its August 2020 launch through efforts like Polkastarter, a decentralized exchange built on Polkadot. Projects have even started attracting attention from Gemini crypto exchange founders the Winklevoss twins, as well as many high-profile sports celebrities.\n\nThat makes DOT, the currency on Polkadot, one to watch closely for 2021. The currency has already grown tenfold. But with a $30 billion market cap, there\u2019s still room for this promising altcoin to run.\n\n \n\nRipple (CCC:XRP-USD) co-founder Jed McCaleb started Stellar in 2014 as an altcoin alternative to XRP. The cryptocurrency facilitates cross-border transactions by using a protocol developed by Stanford professor David Mazi\u00e8res.\n\nThe system itself uses a trusted network, where each person running the software identifies other trusted partners to confirm transactions. That removes the need for the expensive cryptographic mining Bitcoin relies on to validate transactions.\n\nStellar\u2019s fundamental reason for growth however, has more to do with rival XRP\u2019s fall. In December, the SEC charged Ripple and two executives with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering. Around half of all XRP is still owned by founding company Ripple Networks, and its ICOs triggered regulatory red flags.\n\nMeanwhile Stellar has stepped in to fill XRP\u2019s role. Its system of using trusted partners makes it an ideal replacement for quickly moving money between banks. And with a coin price less than $0.40, Stellar is a currency that could still grow many times over.\n\n \n\nCelsius is a smaller cryptocurrency focused on lending and borrowing. Interest rates for would-be borrowers start at just 1% APR, while depositors earn interest on cryptocurrency that would otherwise sit in a stagnant account. Interest rates can rise as high as 15.85% for stablecoins like Tether.\n\nCelsius Network has also wisely registered as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2018, making it far less likely to run into regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe system looks particularly promising thanks to its ease of use. Savers can transfer their entire cryptocurrency account to Celsius Network \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum and all \u2014 without converting to any proprietary coin. And borrowers can take out loans by depositing cryptocurrency, avoiding the need to cash out.\n\nThere are risks of course. An investigation by Coindesk found instances of uncollateralized lending by the network, where a borrower default would leave either Celsius Networks or P2P lenders with irreversible losses. And there\u2019s always a temptation to make riskier loans that earn higher interest payments.\n\nA sudden drop in collateral values (i.e., cryptocurrencies) can also have a knock-on effect to Celsius\u2019 value. As of writing, Celsius requires a 2.7 ETH deposit to borrow $1,000. At today\u2019s crypto prices, a borrower should willingly repay the loan to retrieve their collateral. If ETH prices plummet however, the same person might instead decide to walk away with the money, leaving Celsius investors hoping that the Network hedged its bets.\n\nNevertheless, Celsius shows a great deal of promise. CEL is highly differentiated from Bitcoin, and investment risks will decline as cryptocurrency prices eventually stabilize.\n\n \n\nInvestors might have written off Neo long ago. The China-based cryptocurrency (formerly known as Antshares) went into a tailspin back in 2018 when the Chinese Central Government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. The currency remains almost 80% down from its all-time highs.\n\nYet change is on the horizon. In April last year, the Chinese authorities began a limited rollout of e-yuan, a government-backed cryptocurrency. People expect the CCP to expand the program during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nMuch of this change comes from a recognition that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. And rather than allow outside players like Bitcoin and Ethereum to push finance out of the CCP\u2019s sight, they have started embracing home-grown cryptocurrencies as alternatives.\n\nSmaller Chinese-based cryptocurrencies have already started emerging. VeChain, another promising cryptocurrency, helps Chinese companies with supply-chain management.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to know if the CCP will also anoint Neo a cryptocurrency champion, there\u2019s phenomenal upside to be had if they do.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin\u2019s Nosedive below $45,000 Can Open Way to Continued Correction, Ethereum\u2019s Repeats after...", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/_vAsLCzb6bVpoG_f0ZCrrg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/b76915b30c62f709fbe1d1291f267707", "auther": "Anissimov Konstantin", "body": "BTC/USD started the week at 57,499 near the all-time high at 58,400, based on the CEX.IOpricing. In the first four hours of Monday\u2019s trading session, BTC/USD declined to 56,000, which was an important support level in intraday terms. The level produced some buying pressure for the pair but only for the next four hours, as BTC/USD closed the 4-hour candlestick between 04:00 and 08:00 UTC at 46,479.\n\nThat, however, made no lasting influence, and BTC/USD had broken down below 56,000 and dropped below 53,500 by 16:00 UTC. That was a signal for a big sale, as the Bitcoin market had been overheated. In confirmation of that hypothesis, BTC/USD made a huge rollercoaster swing in the interval between 13:00 and 15:00 UTC, falling from 53,677 to 47,400 and bouncing back up. Meanwhile, Glassnode, an on-chain data aggregator reported that high-net-worth Bitcoin holders had sold 140,000 BTC, which was proof of traders\u2019 readiness to sell BTC/USD big time. There was a slight upside recovery to 56,000 at the end of Monday, but with the start of Tuesday\u2019s session the selling went on.\n\nBy 09:00 UTC of Tuesday, 23rd February, BTC/USD had already been at 46,500 as per Bitstamp\u2019s exchange rate. Form 09:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued sideways, with high volatility taking place in the price action. The pair was edging sideways within the corridor of 45,000 \u2013 49,000 until 01:00 UTC of Wednesday, 24th February. At that time a rebound above 49,000 started to take place and continued until 05:00 UTC, with 51,000 topped out.\n\nThe volatility reduced considerably, as the pair continued edging sideways within the price range of 50,000 \u2013 51,000. At 13:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, a drawdown to 49,000 happened; afterwards, BTC/USD continued between 48,000 \u2013 50,000 until the end of Wednesday. The sideways fluctuations continued on Thursday, 25th February, until 12:00 UTC. At 12:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, BTC/USD bounced to 52,000. Afterwards, BTC/USD began another continued downfall, which continued to 45,000 on Friday, 26th February. The falling stopped at 08:00 UTC, as the zone offered a buying opportunity.\n\nBTC/USD had bounced to 48,265 by 17:00 UTC and then reversed downwards until 23:00 UTC, almost reaching 45,000, and closed Friday at 45,447. On Saturday, 27th February, BTC/USD the bulls continued supporting the trading pair with buying volumes, and BTC/USD briefly rose to 48,100 between 0200 \u2013 02:45 UTC. The pair continued sideways until 07:00 UTC, once breaking above the 50-period hourly SMA, but was eventually driven down below 47,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC. The upside attempts at the SMA continued unsuccessfully until the end of Saturday. On Sunday, 28th February, selling pressure increased and saw BTC/USD gradually head down to 43,067 at its lowest. The capitalisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was an indication of continuing selling bias in the trading pair.\n\nThere was some news in the week of 22nd February that kept up Bitcoin bulls\u2019 hopes of an upside recovery. Square, Inc. that had invested $50,000 million in Bitcoin in October 2020 made another Bitcoin purchase worth $170 million on 24th February 2021. Besides that, MicroStrategy \u2013 the corporate frontrunner among Bitcoin investors \u2013 bought 19,452 more BTC worth $1.026 billion at an average price of $52,765. This new purchase had brought MicroStrategy\u2019s exposure to Bitcoin to 90,531 BTC.\n\nThese tendencies clearly showed that high profile investors were happy with the Bitcoin drawdown and were ready to buy the dip. This shows that Bitcoin continues to be looked upon as a solid financial instrument, and every downside correction is going to be met with substantial buying volumes.\n\nThe decline to nearly 43,000 and a stabilisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was a signal of continuing bearish bias in BTC/USD, promising lower lows. Still, some bullish momentum remains to be present, and a breakthrough above 48,000 and above the 50-period 4-hour SMA would signal a change of bias and an upside recovery gaining traction. On the contrary, another decline to 43,000 will mean a continuation of bearish price action, with prospects of getting back to testing the 31,000 support level.\n\nTherefore, we shall soon get answers on where BTC/USD will go next. With the pair edging higher towards 48,000 in the morning hours of Monday, the odds for a breakthrough are presently going higher.\n\nETH/USD opened the week of 22nd February at 1,933.4 and headed straight down from the start of the day, briefly getting below the 50-period 4-hour SMA with the lower wick of Monday\u2019s first 4-hour candlestick reaching 1,867.3. The SMA gave ETH/USD some transitory support, but it continued sinking lower until 09:00 UTC on Tuesday, 23rd February, with support being found at 1,440. The trading pair continued sideways until the end of Tuesday, fluctuating within a considerable range of 1,360 and 1,600.\n\nFrom the start of Wednesday, 24th February, the ETH/USD trading pair headed upwards to reach 1,715 and break above the 50-period hourly SMA. The volatility shrank considerably, as ETH/USD spent most of the time until 18:00 UTC on Thursday, 25th February within the range of 1,586.4 \u2013 1,662, being regularly supported by the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nETH/USD, ETH/USD headed down from 18:00 UTC on Thursday through to 08:00 UTC on Friday, 26th February. The pair eventually hit 1,402 at the minimum and continued edging sideways between 1,424.7 and 1,560 until the end of Saturday, 27th February, with the 50-period hourly SMA upkeeping the ETH/USD bearish momentum.\n\nAnother downswing took place on Sunday, 28th February, with a minimum at 1,299.6. However, an upside recovery that began at 19:00 UTC and continued through to the end of Sunday, with the 1,392.2 support level letting ETH/USD close the week at 1,417.5 as per the CEX.IO pricing. On top of that, ETH/USD finished Sunday in a hammer candlestick on the daily timeframe, which coupled with the 1,420 support level gives increased potential for a full-fledged upside recovery in the near term.\n\nIt became known that the intraday pullback in ETH/USD between Tuesday, 23rd February, and Wednesday, 24th February, from the mid-to-lower 1,400s to above 1,700 coincided with a purchase of 10,000 ETH by Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which brought its Ether exposure to 3.17 ETH.\n\nThe bullish market reaction to the purchase clearly shows that big players\u2019 moves have a strong impact on the Ethereum market. And the purchase itself shows that high-profile investors, who constitute most of Grayscale clients, have trust in Ethereum in the long term, which can result in continued market growth for the smart-contract pioneer.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Continues to Show Strength \n-  S&P 500 Price Forecast \u2013 Stock Markets Recover on Monday \n-  Target Has Strong Upside Potential; Likely to Log Over 50% Jump in Q4 Profit \n-  GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues Noisy Behavior \n-  GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Gives up Early Gains \n-  Stocks Move Higher At The Start Of The Month \n"}, {"headline": "BTC/USD stagnates under 50,000, ETH/USD sinks under 1,500", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/1.CMBbcF7Ty_T6LdBMUGSg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3163aad28e8c2f2b8cadc514cd079893", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "BTC/USD made a bullish attack at 50,000 early on 2nd March, but it was swiftly curbed by the mark, with the pair finding itself under 48,000 at the end of the day. Buying pressure was still there, but more buying volumes might be required for a pullback above 50,000 to come through.\n\nBTC/USD opened 2nd March at 49,720 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair edged above 50,000 in the first hour but found itself at 49,556 at the hour\u2019s close. An intraday retracement took the pair to 48,354 at 08:00 UTC. Having risen above 49,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC, the pair continued sideways until 16:00, clinging to the 49,000 handle. By 16:00 UTC, a head-and-shoulders-looking pattern had formed and was confirmed with a bearish candlestick between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC that landed on 47,500 and the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nThe moving average did support the price, signaling some lack of confidence of the bears and the presence of buying appetite. The pair continued trending mildly upwards, consistently leaning on the 50-period hourly moving average until 19:00 UTC, but slipped below it at 20:00 UTC.\n\nThe failure of the breakthrough above 50,000, should extend the expectations of an exit out the horizontal channel between 43,000 and 50,000. The update on corporate and institutional holdings from Bitcointreasuries.com on the day showed that the cumulative figure had reached 1.36 million BTC worth around $65 billion at the time. This is an apparent sign of continuing demand for Bitcoin from high-profile investors. Considering their traditional long-term investment fashion, their demand might play a key role in Bitcoin\u2019s financial maturity.\n\nETH/USD spent most of the trading session of 2nd March between 1,540 and 1,580. Selling pressure increased at 16:00 UTC, and the trading pair slipped to under 1,500 in the day\u2019s later hours.\u00a0\n\nETH/USD started 2nd March at 1,572 and produced a sharp spike to 1,600. But the buying volumes were too small, and the pair quickly got back to 1,570, continuing sideways between 1,540 and 1,580 for the most part until 16:00 UTC. Between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, ETH/USD broke down below 1,540 and closed the hour at 1,503.5 based on the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair was consistently heading down afterwards and slipped to 1,460 \u2013 1,480 in the period between 20:00 \u2013 23:00 UTC.\n\nMeanwhile, The Block shows that Ethereum miners set a new record for monthly earnings in February 2021, having earned $1.37 billion during the 28-day-long month. Of those, $772.78 million were transaction fees and $644.4 million were block rewards, which is the first precedent of transaction fees dominating block rewards in Ethereum miners\u2019 revenues on a monthly basis in all of Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nThis shows how much demand is going on for Ethereum as a means of transfer of value, the DeFi market probably being the biggest driver of that demand, as its market capitalisation grew to 71.87 billion, according to CoinGecko, as of 2nd March. Also, the anticipation of the transition of Ethereum to the PoS Beacon Chain is heating up demand for Ether as a means of passive income: according to The Block, the ETH 2.0 deposit contract had 3.33 million ETH on 2nd March.\n\nETH/USD might have found a resting point between 1,460 \u2013 1,570 and may continue sideways on shrinking volatility for a while before taking a turn outside this corridor. The 1,392 daily support level can be a source of resurging buying pressure for ETH/USD in the scenario of a gradual decline.\n"}, {"headline": "Kings of Leon NFT Album: 17 Things to Know as the Rock Album Goes Digital", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/bsE5E5QZ6y_tR2wjagS_8g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/9d4966ecff929dbfd34f5681bdb729ff", "auther": "Vivian Medithi ", "body": "American rock band Kings of Leon have announced their next album will be released as a non-fungible token (NFT) this Friday, just the latest high-profile digital collectible coming to market at a time of skyrocketing interest in cryptoassets.\n\n \n\nHere\u2019s what investors should know about the new album, \u201cNFT Yourself,\u201d coming out Friday, March 5:\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH uptrend to $2,000 in grave danger amid flashing sell signals", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/REIeQHMAYcmTIXjf3ot2qQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bfcbe8c59e51f681a528c61f971e9894", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Ethereum's technical breakout on Monday had a target close to $1,700, but the price recovery failed to overcome the barrier at $1,600. A correction is underway with Ether struggling to hold above $1,500.\n\nEthereum gas fees is exorbitantly high, but the situation has become a norm. Over the last 30 to 60 days, the fee used to make transactions on the network increased significantly. While the gas averages at $12, there are instances where it swells three to four times.\n\nHowever, Santiment's data reveals that a spike in the gas fees usually lasts an average of 30 to 60 minutes. What is intriguing is that the upswings in the gas tend to coincide with Ether's local price bottoms and short-term bounce backs.\n\n\n\nEthereum average fees (21 days)\n\nNote that this finding is not conclusive but gives an insight into the gas fee spikes, which could be triggered by panic selloffs in conjunction with 'paper hand' capitulation. A buy the dip pressure then results in Ethereum's short-term bottom and a pullback.\n\nEther is trading at $1,545 and flirting with the 50 Simple Moving Average (SMA). The breakout from the falling wedge pattern suggested that the liftoff will hit levels close to $1,700. Moreover, a step above the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) could trigger more buy orders as investors anticipate a return to highs above $2,000.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nMeanwhile, failing to hold above the 50 SMA on the 4-hour chart would be a bearish signal. Panic-selling will increase the overhead pressure, forcing Ethereum to explore downhill levels toward $1,200.\n\nNotably, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal in the form of a green nine candlestick. The bearish signal comes at a time when the uptrend is in jeopardy. If validated, the pioneer altcoin will fall in one to four 4-hour candlesticks, adding credibility to the bearish narrative.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe uptrend will be secured if Ethereum manages to hold onto the 50 SMA support on the 4-hour chart. Besides, the falling wedge pattern's impact is still in the picture, and with a small boost, ETH could swing to highs above $1,700. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has a bullish impulse, which could keep buyer interest high.\n"}, {"headline": "Stellar Lumens Is Impressive as a Technology But Not Currently as a Trade", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jDGEk7m07GGEvjcDeE4_KQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/c29b5e8f640f2124ee5501dc12ec92d4", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "As a fundamental fintech innovation, it\u2019s hard not get excited about Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) and its underlying blockchain technology. While we have increasingly become a digitalization-of-everything economy, our payment processing solutions remain curiously archaic. Stellar offers a viable alternative but does that necessarily bode well for its XLM cryptocurrency token?\n\n \n\nI\u2019m going to dive into the nuances of this question. But first, I believe the integration of the Stellar Lumens blockchain technology into mainstream financial institutions should be encouraged. And at some point, you\u2019d figure that this staid industry will be forced to accept that we live in the 21st century.\n\nRecently, I had the displeasure of having to make a wire transfer to another U.S.-based bank. The cost to me was $25 to make the transfer. Additionally, the time it took for the wire transfer to process, along with associated filings was about one week \u2013 that\u2019s an eternity in our supposedly advanced society.\n\nOn the flipside, cryptocurrency transactions occur much quicker and cheaper. Earlier this year, I made several Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) transactions, with the process taking a few hours to complete and with transaction fees in the single-digit dollar range.\n\nHowever, crypto proponents consider Bitcoin as the transactional laggard in this space. Other cryptocurrency transactions, such as through the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) or Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) blockchains occur at lightning-fast speeds and with more modest fees.\n\nAnd this is where Stellar Lumens truly shines. The platform is one of the fastest. Better yet, because of its low flat fees, Stellar opens the door to a viable micropayments economy. In turn, this will help bring the developing part of the world into the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nPlus, we don\u2019t even have to think so globally. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 5.4% or roughly 7.1 million households were unbanked in 2019. Due to the pandemic and the resultant economic crisis, this figure will surely increase.\n\nBefore I go any further into the investment proposition of Stellar Lumens, I need to make a comprehensive disclosure. Yes, I own XLM tokens, but the amount that I have now is a pittance compared to my prior holdings.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m necessarily bearish on XLM. However, when the cryptocurrency market started going sour a little over a week ago, I began taking evasive action. I converted some of my XLM holdings into BTC and some into cold hard cash.\n\nAs I watch the Stellar Lumens token tumble downward \u2013 albeit with a few head fakes here and there \u2013 I\u2019m regretting that I didn\u2019t go all into cash. Oh well. If I\u2019ve learned anything about cryptocurrencies over the years, you just never know where they might end up.\n\nExcept that I did know \u2013 at least, in my own mind. Aside from my own second guessing, the XLM price action looked weak following its trend collapse on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23. Subsequent trades have attempted to push the price back up toward 50 cents, but to no avail.\n\nCan the Stellar Lumens token recover that support level and make its way toward all-time highs? Perhaps, but that will likely depend on Bitcoin. Unfortunately, from where I stand Bitcoin looks like a basket case. Gone is the moxie that took the original virtual currency to the edge of $60,000. Instead, BTC stakeholders should consider themselves fortunate if it doesn\u2019t fall below $40,000.\n\nBelow $40K? Yeah, it can happen (though of course I\u2019m not guaranteeing it) precisely for the same reason why the cryptocurrencies started skyrocketing earlier this year: big institutions are embracing this digital revolution. They\u2019re wonderful to have when they\u2019re driving up the asset. But if these alpha dogs decide to sell, the volatility could be unprecedented.\n\nAs Bitcoin reaches down and cuts into institutional profits, you can rest assured that they\u2019ll dump like mad to preserve their wealth.\n\nThen, you also must factor in human concerns such as tax season and rising bond yields. For the former, Tax Day is approaching, which means profit taking may be in order to help ease the burden imposed by Uncle Sam.\n\nBut the latter case is the most intriguing one for me. The sudden rise in yields not only demonstrates that the incentive to hold risk-on assets is diminishing, it highlights that cryptocurrencies represent the riskiest asset class of them all. It doesn\u2019t pay dividends and it has severe third-party risk in terms of government intervention and/or cyberattacks.\n\nIf the Russians can compromise our most secure assets, then a disruptive attack on the crypto ecosystem seems like child\u2019s play.\n\nFor me, there seems to be too many questions to be comfortable wagering on Stellar Lumens right now. Personally, I\u2019d wait until Bitcoin stabilizes. If not, a low-30-cent/high-20-cent price range wouldn\u2019t be too surprising given the context.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in XLM, BTC, ETH, LTC.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

"auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Some traders assume that Bitcoin\u00a0(CCC:BTC-USD) is the gold standard among cryptocurrencies. There might be merit to that claim, but let\u2019s keep an open mind. Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) also deserves a place in your crypto portfolio \u2014 and you can buy some at a discount, as the price of Ethereum dropped hard recently.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the price is still higher than it was a year ago. Actually, you could say that about the most popular cryptocurrencies in general, since they tend to move together.\n\nSo, why should you invest in Ethereum in particular? As we\u2019ll explore, this digital token could actually exhibit a level of stability that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t.\n\nEstablishing stability is important because cryptocurrency is sometimes considered to be too speculative to take seriously as an investment. Now, let\u2019s start off with a little bit of technical analysis and see if we can detect any noteworthy price patterns.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to consider that around a year ago, during the onset of the novel coronavirus crisis, the Ethereum price actually fell below $100.\n\nIn hindsight, we now know that $100 would have been a terrific buy-up price. We might never see that price again, and prospective ETH owners must now consider whether to buy it in the quadruple digits.\n\nThe price didn\u2019t reach $1,000 in 2020, but Ethereum did achieve that milestone in early January of 2021. And on Feb. 20, the price briefly touched the important $2,000 price point.\n\nBut then, a sharp multi-day pullback happened. On the morning of March 1, the price was slightly above $1,500.\n\nThere didn\u2019t seem to be any Ethereum-specific news that would cause such a sharp price drop.\n\nEvidently, a bout of profit taking occurred within the broader cryptocurrency space, and that seems to have impacted the price of ETH.\n\nIf Bitcoin has a reputation for volatility, then perhaps Ethereum should be known as a more stable cryptocurrency.\n\nIt\u2019s true that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized digital tokens, and that they\u2019re both based on blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, ETH is known for storing smart contracts, which are basically programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAnd, according to researchers Ayana T. Aspembitova, Ling Feng and Lock Yue Chew, that\u2019s not the only thing that sets the currency apart.\n\nIn a journal article titled \u201cBehavioral structure of users in cryptocurrency market,\u201d the researchers observed behavior-based differences between the two most popular cryptocurrencies:\n\n\u201c\u2026 being the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been widely used for speculative purposes\u2026 the behavior of ethereum users is observed to be more stable as these users are more optimistic of the market. In contrast, the behavior of the bitcoin users tend to fluctuate according to the trend of the market, with a loss of optimism when the market goes down.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an outcome which some folks might not have expected. Yet, I must admit that in my observation of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, the latter token does seem to exhibit less price volatility.\n\nAnd here\u2019s some more research to add to your arsenal. As reported by Nairametrics, the number of Ethereum Percent Addresses in a state of profit was recently recorded to be 96.374%.\n\nIn other words, slightly more than 96% of the circulating ETH supply is currently in a state of profit. And, that number represents a one-month low.\n\nSo, even after a major price correction, it\u2019s probably safe to conclude that the majority of Ethereum holders are profitable. I\u2019ll acknowledge that if you chased the price near $2,000, your timing wasn\u2019t necessarily ideal.\n\nYet, there\u2019s hope for a full recovery. You should expect volatility for any cryptocurrency. Thankfully, Ethereum might be less risky than some other coins.\n\nPrice fluctuations will occur, and that\u2019s a normal part of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nIf anything, the price drop in ETH should be viewed as an opportunity. And among the most popular digital tokens, Ethereum could perhaps be a comparatively stable holding.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist,\u00a0TalkMarkets,\u00a0Finom\u00a0Group,\u00a0Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

However, this may prove to be nothing more than a counter-trend correction, as both digital assets bounce off of key support and accelerate higher. \n\nMoreover, the endorsement of the cryptocurrency market by two major investment banks, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, could further validate the digital currency market and intensify capital inflows in the near term. Citigroup\u2019s Global Perspectives and Solutions thinktank stated that Bitcoin could become \u201cthe currency of choice for international trade\u201d, while Goldman plans to offer Bitcoin futures by the middle of this month. \n\nThis comes on the back of Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s statement that it would treat BTC the same as any other financial asset and Mastercard\u2019s commitment to integrate Bitcoin into its payment network. Tesla also announced a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin and plans to begin accepting it as a form of payment. These developments will probably underpin both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the coming weeks and may even result in resumption of the primary uptrends extending from the March 2020 nadirs. Here are the key levels to watch for BTC/USD and ETH/USD.\n\nBitcoin daily chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe formation of a bullish Hammer reversal candle at the 34-EMA (45176), followed by a Bullish Engulfing candle as validation, suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s 7-day correction lower could be at an end. \n\nWith the RSI bursting back above 50, and the MACD tracking firmly above its neutral midpoint, the path of least resistance seems skewed to topside. \n\nA daily close back above psychological resistance at 50,000 would probably intensify near-term buying pressure and generate an impulsive push to retest the yearly high (58,321). Hurdling that brings the 61.8% Fibonacci (61298) and 65,000 mark into the crosshairs.\n\nHowever, if 50,000 holds firm, a more extended pullback to former resistance-turned-support at the January high (41969) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 69.56% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.28 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.46% lower than yesterday and 25.31% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 12.22% lower than yesterday and 28.40% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Bitcoin prices may continue to fall.\n\nTraders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger Bitcoin-bearish contrarian trading bias.\n\nEthereum daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nEthereum also looks set to climb higher in the coming days, as prices surge away from confluent support at the trend-defining 55-EMA and 2018 high (1424). \n\nGaining a firm foothold back above psychological resistance at 1600 would likely pave the way for buyers to retest the yearly high (2036). A daily close above is ultimately needed to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and bring the 100% Fibonacci (2410) into focus. \n\nAlternatively, a daily close below range support at 1400 \u2013 1440 could encourage would-be sellers and result in a pullback to mobile support at the 100-MA (1108). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 86.84% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 6.60 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.39% lower than yesterday and 24.39% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 16.22% lower than yesterday and 21.72% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Ethereum prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed Ethereum trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin (BTC/USD), Ethereum (ETH/USD) Rallying Sharply as the Bulls Wrestle Back Control", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/N8NkPHuyCUNK.Mw1v5Swtg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/ed541f1965e6c7bb14b43c8cfe11bed2", "auther": "Nick Cawley", "body": "A sea of green in the cryptocurrency space with some coins recording early double-digit gains. Last week\u2019s sell-off has been absorbed and the technical picture for both Bitcoin and Ethereum now looks increasingly positive. As always with the cryptocurrency, the real reason for the move is never immediately clear although a few recent actions are likely to be put forward as drivers of the recent move. A recent tweet by the CEO of a South Korean crypto-analytics firm that the large Bitcoin trades recently indicate OTC-buying by cryptocurrency \u2018whales\u2019 will have buoyed the bulls, while Goldman Sachs is said to be firing up its cryptocurrency trading desk again and will begin trading bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards. In addition, cryptocurrency miner, publicly-quoted Argo Blockchain, today said that it will pay its CEO in Bitcoin and allow other employees to be in Bitcoin if they wish.\n\nWhile in isolation these events may not spark a strong move, in combination they continue to point to increased adoption and interest in the space, a space that needs little news to spark a strong move. Emotion is a strong driver in the cryptocurrency market and if the recent move has taken out selling interest, then a fresh move higher looks the path of least resistance.\n\nHow to Manage the Emotions of Trading\n\nA look at the daily charts suggests that the recent sell-off is being pared back and if BTC/USD can regain its bullish channel, fresh all-time highs are likely.The CCI reading shows Bitcoin landed in oversold territory recently for the first time since late-January, with the previous oversold reading back in September 2020 when BTC traded around $10,000. It looks as though oversold signals have been drivers of strong rallies. The bullish channel is steep and BTC/USD will likely have to make a fresh all-time high to regain it.\n\nEthereum (ETH/USD) continues its pullback from the late-February sell-off and is looking to re-test $1,700 and potentially higher. Again the CCI indicator highlighted heavily oversold conditions, while the 50-day simple moving average helped to stem the sell-off and if closed and opened above will turn into stronger support. The next area of resistance lies between $1,700 and $1,780 before the February 20 high of $2,036 comes into play.\n\nTraders of all levels and abilities will find something to help them make more informed decisions in the new and improved DailyFX Trading Education Centre\n\nWhat are your views on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 bullish or bearish??

Back then, cryptocurrencies tumbled a combined 81%, wiping out almost $600 billion in market capitalization and sending Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and other altcoins on a multi-year recovery journey few want to relive.\n\nThis time however, looks slightly different. Bitcoin has far wider adoption, particularly among payment processors like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ). And high-profile thefts have also become rarer as security has improved. That makes Bitcoin far more likely to stay relevant, even as prices gyrate.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s stability comes at the expense of more limited upside. The cryptocurrency\u2019s $800 billion market cap already makes it the fifth-largest currency in the world. A doubling would make it as large as the U.S. Dollar, while 10x growth would make it more valuable than all the physical gold ever mined.\n\nThat means investors looking for the next 100x cryptocurrency need to look at altcoins \u2014 smaller cryptocurrencies that still have a chance of making it big. Because when you\u2019re buying a currency worth $10 billion, there\u2019s a far better chance of considerable gains ahead.\n\nBitcoin itself is a technological dinosaur relative to other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain transactions, for instance, cost $15 to perform and takes ten minutes to confirm.\n\nBut as the first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has maintained its lead thanks to a strong community and widespread adoption. That means successful altcoins will need far more than minor technological improvements. Bitcoin Cash, for instance, remains 80% beneath its all-time highs despite having a higher transaction per second limit than its predecessor.\n\nInstead, successful altcoins will look much more like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), a long-time favorite altcoin:\n\nAltcoins aren\u2019t necessarily for everyone. Even the most promising will stumble if programming flaws emerge \u2014 and significant initial coin offerings (ICOs) are often notoriously overpriced, leading to long-term underperformance.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s shadow will still loom over the crypto landscape, here are five promising altcoins every investor should know:\n\nAltcoins that gain scale could pose a threat to Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. The legacy cryptocurrency still relies on third parties to batch orders and act as a middleman to overcome Bitcoin\u2019s cost and lack of speed. The next generation of coins promises to perform these tasks independently. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n \n\nCardano remains one of the most advanced general-use altcoins on the market. This third-generation coin uses a proof-of-stake system, compared with the standard proof-of-work. That makes the system far more efficient than Bitcoin and faster as well.\n\nThe Cardano Foundation also has an all-star team running the show. The currency was started in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, and retains an active development community. Today, the team is led by digital payments veteran Frederik Gregaard, an old hand who once led PwC\u2019s Digital Financial Services division.\n\nADA, the currency run on the Cardano Network, has already advanced 4,400% since its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. As the currency gains greater exposure, investors ae now seeing price targets of $10 start appearing \u2014 significant upside for a coin available for less than $1 today.\n\n \n\nPolkadot was founded by another alum of the Ethereum Project \u2014 Chief Technology Officer Gavin Wood. And this altcoin takes an entirely different approach to cryptocurrencies.\n\nRather than host a single ever-growing blockchain, Polkadot uses parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that run in parallel. That solves Bitcoin\u2019s problem of managing a single ledger \u2014 one that\u2019s already over 320 GB in size.\n\nThe altcoin has seen spectacular growth since its August 2020 launch through efforts like Polkastarter, a decentralized exchange built on Polkadot. Projects have even started attracting attention from Gemini crypto exchange founders the Winklevoss twins, as well as many high-profile sports celebrities.\n\nThat makes DOT, the currency on Polkadot, one to watch closely for 2021. The currency has already grown tenfold. But with a $30 billion market cap, there\u2019s still room for this promising altcoin to run.\n\n \n\nRipple (CCC:XRP-USD) co-founder Jed McCaleb started Stellar in 2014 as an altcoin alternative to XRP. The cryptocurrency facilitates cross-border transactions by using a protocol developed by Stanford professor David Mazi\u00e8res.\n\nThe system itself uses a trusted network, where each person running the software identifies other trusted partners to confirm transactions. That removes the need for the expensive cryptographic mining Bitcoin relies on to validate transactions.\n\nStellar\u2019s fundamental reason for growth however, has more to do with rival XRP\u2019s fall. In December, the SEC charged Ripple and two executives with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering. Around half of all XRP is still owned by founding company Ripple Networks, and its ICOs triggered regulatory red flags.\n\nMeanwhile Stellar has stepped in to fill XRP\u2019s role. Its system of using trusted partners makes it an ideal replacement for quickly moving money between banks. And with a coin price less than $0.40, Stellar is a currency that could still grow many times over.\n\n \n\nCelsius is a smaller cryptocurrency focused on lending and borrowing. Interest rates for would-be borrowers start at just 1% APR, while depositors earn interest on cryptocurrency that would otherwise sit in a stagnant account. Interest rates can rise as high as 15.85% for stablecoins like Tether.\n\nCelsius Network has also wisely registered as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2018, making it far less likely to run into regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe system looks particularly promising thanks to its ease of use. Savers can transfer their entire cryptocurrency account to Celsius Network \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum and all \u2014 without converting to any proprietary coin. And borrowers can take out loans by depositing cryptocurrency, avoiding the need to cash out.\n\nThere are risks of course. An investigation by Coindesk found instances of uncollateralized lending by the network, where a borrower default would leave either Celsius Networks or P2P lenders with irreversible losses. And there\u2019s always a temptation to make riskier loans that earn higher interest payments.\n\nA sudden drop in collateral values (i.e., cryptocurrencies) can also have a knock-on effect to Celsius\u2019 value. As of writing, Celsius requires a 2.7 ETH deposit to borrow $1,000. At today\u2019s crypto prices, a borrower should willingly repay the loan to retrieve their collateral. If ETH prices plummet however, the same person might instead decide to walk away with the money, leaving Celsius investors hoping that the Network hedged its bets.\n\nNevertheless, Celsius shows a great deal of promise. CEL is highly differentiated from Bitcoin, and investment risks will decline as cryptocurrency prices eventually stabilize.\n\n \n\nInvestors might have written off Neo long ago. The China-based cryptocurrency (formerly known as Antshares) went into a tailspin back in 2018 when the Chinese Central Government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. The currency remains almost 80% down from its all-time highs.\n\nYet change is on the horizon. In April last year, the Chinese authorities began a limited rollout of e-yuan, a government-backed cryptocurrency. People expect the CCP to expand the program during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nMuch of this change comes from a recognition that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. And rather than allow outside players like Bitcoin and Ethereum to push finance out of the CCP\u2019s sight, they have started embracing home-grown cryptocurrencies as alternatives.\n\nSmaller Chinese-based cryptocurrencies have already started emerging. VeChain, another promising cryptocurrency, helps Chinese companies with supply-chain management.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to know if the CCP will also anoint Neo a cryptocurrency champion, there\u2019s phenomenal upside to be had if they do.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin\u2019s Nosedive below $45,000 Can Open Way to Continued Correction, Ethereum\u2019s Repeats after...", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/_vAsLCzb6bVpoG_f0ZCrrg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/b76915b30c62f709fbe1d1291f267707", "auther": "Anissimov Konstantin", "body": "BTC/USD started the week at 57,499 near the all-time high at 58,400, based on the CEX.IOpricing. In the first four hours of Monday\u2019s trading session, BTC/USD declined to 56,000, which was an important support level in intraday terms. The level produced some buying pressure for the pair but only for the next four hours, as BTC/USD closed the 4-hour candlestick between 04:00 and 08:00 UTC at 46,479.\n\nThat, however, made no lasting influence, and BTC/USD had broken down below 56,000 and dropped below 53,500 by 16:00 UTC. That was a signal for a big sale, as the Bitcoin market had been overheated. In confirmation of that hypothesis, BTC/USD made a huge rollercoaster swing in the interval between 13:00 and 15:00 UTC, falling from 53,677 to 47,400 and bouncing back up. Meanwhile, Glassnode, an on-chain data aggregator reported that high-net-worth Bitcoin holders had sold 140,000 BTC, which was proof of traders\u2019 readiness to sell BTC/USD big time. There was a slight upside recovery to 56,000 at the end of Monday, but with the start of Tuesday\u2019s session the selling went on.\n\nBy 09:00 UTC of Tuesday, 23rd February, BTC/USD had already been at 46,500 as per Bitstamp\u2019s exchange rate. Form 09:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued sideways, with high volatility taking place in the price action. The pair was edging sideways within the corridor of 45,000 \u2013 49,000 until 01:00 UTC of Wednesday, 24th February. At that time a rebound above 49,000 started to take place and continued until 05:00 UTC, with 51,000 topped out.\n\nThe volatility reduced considerably, as the pair continued edging sideways within the price range of 50,000 \u2013 51,000. At 13:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, a drawdown to 49,000 happened; afterwards, BTC/USD continued between 48,000 \u2013 50,000 until the end of Wednesday. The sideways fluctuations continued on Thursday, 25th February, until 12:00 UTC. At 12:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, BTC/USD bounced to 52,000. Afterwards, BTC/USD began another continued downfall, which continued to 45,000 on Friday, 26th February. The falling stopped at 08:00 UTC, as the zone offered a buying opportunity.\n\nBTC/USD had bounced to 48,265 by 17:00 UTC and then reversed downwards until 23:00 UTC, almost reaching 45,000, and closed Friday at 45,447. On Saturday, 27th February, BTC/USD the bulls continued supporting the trading pair with buying volumes, and BTC/USD briefly rose to 48,100 between 0200 \u2013 02:45 UTC. The pair continued sideways until 07:00 UTC, once breaking above the 50-period hourly SMA, but was eventually driven down below 47,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC. The upside attempts at the SMA continued unsuccessfully until the end of Saturday. On Sunday, 28th February, selling pressure increased and saw BTC/USD gradually head down to 43,067 at its lowest. The capitalisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was an indication of continuing selling bias in the trading pair.\n\nThere was some news in the week of 22nd February that kept up Bitcoin bulls\u2019 hopes of an upside recovery. Square, Inc. that had invested $50,000 million in Bitcoin in October 2020 made another Bitcoin purchase worth $170 million on 24th February 2021. Besides that, MicroStrategy \u2013 the corporate frontrunner among Bitcoin investors \u2013 bought 19,452 more BTC worth $1.026 billion at an average price of $52,765. This new purchase had brought MicroStrategy\u2019s exposure to Bitcoin to 90,531 BTC.\n\nThese tendencies clearly showed that high profile investors were happy with the Bitcoin drawdown and were ready to buy the dip. This shows that Bitcoin continues to be looked upon as a solid financial instrument, and every downside correction is going to be met with substantial buying volumes.\n\nThe decline to nearly 43,000 and a stabilisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was a signal of continuing bearish bias in BTC/USD, promising lower lows. Still, some bullish momentum remains to be present, and a breakthrough above 48,000 and above the 50-period 4-hour SMA would signal a change of bias and an upside recovery gaining traction. On the contrary, another decline to 43,000 will mean a continuation of bearish price action, with prospects of getting back to testing the 31,000 support level.\n\nTherefore, we shall soon get answers on where BTC/USD will go next. With the pair edging higher towards 48,000 in the morning hours of Monday, the odds for a breakthrough are presently going higher.\n\nETH/USD opened the week of 22nd February at 1,933.4 and headed straight down from the start of the day, briefly getting below the 50-period 4-hour SMA with the lower wick of Monday\u2019s first 4-hour candlestick reaching 1,867.3. The SMA gave ETH/USD some transitory support, but it continued sinking lower until 09:00 UTC on Tuesday, 23rd February, with support being found at 1,440. The trading pair continued sideways until the end of Tuesday, fluctuating within a considerable range of 1,360 and 1,600.\n\nFrom the start of Wednesday, 24th February, the ETH/USD trading pair headed upwards to reach 1,715 and break above the 50-period hourly SMA. The volatility shrank considerably, as ETH/USD spent most of the time until 18:00 UTC on Thursday, 25th February within the range of 1,586.4 \u2013 1,662, being regularly supported by the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nETH/USD, ETH/USD headed down from 18:00 UTC on Thursday through to 08:00 UTC on Friday, 26th February. The pair eventually hit 1,402 at the minimum and continued edging sideways between 1,424.7 and 1,560 until the end of Saturday, 27th February, with the 50-period hourly SMA upkeeping the ETH/USD bearish momentum.\n\nAnother downswing took place on Sunday, 28th February, with a minimum at 1,299.6. However, an upside recovery that began at 19:00 UTC and continued through to the end of Sunday, with the 1,392.2 support level letting ETH/USD close the week at 1,417.5 as per the CEX.IO pricing. On top of that, ETH/USD finished Sunday in a hammer candlestick on the daily timeframe, which coupled with the 1,420 support level gives increased potential for a full-fledged upside recovery in the near term.\n\nIt became known that the intraday pullback in ETH/USD between Tuesday, 23rd February, and Wednesday, 24th February, from the mid-to-lower 1,400s to above 1,700 coincided with a purchase of 10,000 ETH by Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which brought its Ether exposure to 3.17 ETH.\n\nThe bullish market reaction to the purchase clearly shows that big players\u2019 moves have a strong impact on the Ethereum market. And the purchase itself shows that high-profile investors, who constitute most of Grayscale clients, have trust in Ethereum in the long term, which can result in continued market growth for the smart-contract pioneer.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Continues to Show Strength \n-  S&P 500 Price Forecast \u2013 Stock Markets Recover on Monday \n-  Target Has Strong Upside Potential; Likely to Log Over 50% Jump in Q4 Profit \n-  GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues Noisy Behavior \n-  GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Gives up Early Gains \n-  Stocks Move Higher At The Start Of The Month \n"}, {"headline": "BTC/USD stagnates under 50,000, ETH/USD sinks under 1,500", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/1.CMBbcF7Ty_T6LdBMUGSg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3163aad28e8c2f2b8cadc514cd079893", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "BTC/USD made a bullish attack at 50,000 early on 2nd March, but it was swiftly curbed by the mark, with the pair finding itself under 48,000 at the end of the day. Buying pressure was still there, but more buying volumes might be required for a pullback above 50,000 to come through.\n\nBTC/USD opened 2nd March at 49,720 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair edged above 50,000 in the first hour but found itself at 49,556 at the hour\u2019s close. An intraday retracement took the pair to 48,354 at 08:00 UTC. Having risen above 49,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC, the pair continued sideways until 16:00, clinging to the 49,000 handle. By 16:00 UTC, a head-and-shoulders-looking pattern had formed and was confirmed with a bearish candlestick between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC that landed on 47,500 and the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nThe moving average did support the price, signaling some lack of confidence of the bears and the presence of buying appetite. The pair continued trending mildly upwards, consistently leaning on the 50-period hourly moving average until 19:00 UTC, but slipped below it at 20:00 UTC.\n\nThe failure of the breakthrough above 50,000, should extend the expectations of an exit out the horizontal channel between 43,000 and 50,000. The update on corporate and institutional holdings from Bitcointreasuries.com on the day showed that the cumulative figure had reached 1.36 million BTC worth around $65 billion at the time. This is an apparent sign of continuing demand for Bitcoin from high-profile investors. Considering their traditional long-term investment fashion, their demand might play a key role in Bitcoin\u2019s financial maturity.\n\nETH/USD spent most of the trading session of 2nd March between 1,540 and 1,580. Selling pressure increased at 16:00 UTC, and the trading pair slipped to under 1,500 in the day\u2019s later hours.\u00a0\n\nETH/USD started 2nd March at 1,572 and produced a sharp spike to 1,600. But the buying volumes were too small, and the pair quickly got back to 1,570, continuing sideways between 1,540 and 1,580 for the most part until 16:00 UTC. Between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, ETH/USD broke down below 1,540 and closed the hour at 1,503.5 based on the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair was consistently heading down afterwards and slipped to 1,460 \u2013 1,480 in the period between 20:00 \u2013 23:00 UTC.\n\nMeanwhile, The Block shows that Ethereum miners set a new record for monthly earnings in February 2021, having earned $1.37 billion during the 28-day-long month. Of those, $772.78 million were transaction fees and $644.4 million were block rewards, which is the first precedent of transaction fees dominating block rewards in Ethereum miners\u2019 revenues on a monthly basis in all of Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nThis shows how much demand is going on for Ethereum as a means of transfer of value, the DeFi market probably being the biggest driver of that demand, as its market capitalisation grew to 71.87 billion, according to CoinGecko, as of 2nd March. Also, the anticipation of the transition of Ethereum to the PoS Beacon Chain is heating up demand for Ether as a means of passive income: according to The Block, the ETH 2.0 deposit contract had 3.33 million ETH on 2nd March.\n\nETH/USD might have found a resting point between 1,460 \u2013 1,570 and may continue sideways on shrinking volatility for a while before taking a turn outside this corridor. The 1,392 daily support level can be a source of resurging buying pressure for ETH/USD in the scenario of a gradual decline.\n"}, {"headline": "Kings of Leon NFT Album: 17 Things to Know as the Rock Album Goes Digital", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/bsE5E5QZ6y_tR2wjagS_8g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/9d4966ecff929dbfd34f5681bdb729ff", "auther": "Vivian Medithi ", "body": "American rock band Kings of Leon have announced their next album will be released as a non-fungible token (NFT) this Friday, just the latest high-profile digital collectible coming to market at a time of skyrocketing interest in cryptoassets.\n\n \n\nHere\u2019s what investors should know about the new album, \u201cNFT Yourself,\u201d coming out Friday, March 5:\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH uptrend to $2,000 in grave danger amid flashing sell signals", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/REIeQHMAYcmTIXjf3ot2qQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bfcbe8c59e51f681a528c61f971e9894", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Ethereum's technical breakout on Monday had a target close to $1,700, but the price recovery failed to overcome the barrier at $1,600.

Over the last 30 to 60 days, the fee used to make transactions on the network increased significantly. While the gas averages at $12, there are instances where it swells three to four times.\n\nHowever, Santiment's data reveals that a spike in the gas fees usually lasts an average of 30 to 60 minutes.

The breakout from the falling wedge pattern suggested that the liftoff will hit levels close to $1,700.

Panic-selling will increase the overhead pressure, forcing Ethereum to explore downhill levels toward $1,200.\n\nNotably, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal in the form of a green nine candlestick. The bearish signal comes at a time when the uptrend is in jeopardy. If validated, the pioneer altcoin will fall in one to four 4-hour candlesticks, adding credibility to the bearish narrative.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe uptrend will be secured if Ethereum manages to hold onto the 50 SMA support on the 4-hour chart.

While we have increasingly become a digitalization-of-everything economy, our payment processing solutions remain curiously archaic. Stellar offers a viable alternative but does that necessarily bode well for its XLM cryptocurrency token?\n\n \n\nI\u2019m going to dive into the nuances of this question. But first, I believe the integration of the Stellar Lumens blockchain technology into mainstream financial institutions should be encouraged. And at some point, you\u2019d figure that this staid industry will be forced to accept that we live in the 21st century.\n\nRecently, I had the displeasure of having to make a wire transfer to another U.S.-based bank. The cost to me was $25 to make the transfer. Additionally, the time it took for the wire transfer to process, along with associated filings was about one week \u2013 that\u2019s an eternity in our supposedly advanced society.\n\nOn the flipside, cryptocurrency transactions occur much quicker and cheaper. Earlier this year, I made several Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) transactions, with the process taking a few hours to complete and with transaction fees in the single-digit dollar range.\n\nHowever, crypto proponents consider Bitcoin as the transactional laggard in this space. Other cryptocurrency transactions, such as through the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) or Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) blockchains occur at lightning-fast speeds and with more modest fees.\n\nAnd this is where Stellar Lumens truly shines. The platform is one of the fastest. Better yet, because of its low flat fees, Stellar opens the door to a viable micropayments economy. In turn, this will help bring the developing part of the world into the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nPlus, we don\u2019t even have to think so globally. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 5.4% or roughly 7.1 million households were unbanked in 2019. Due to the pandemic and the resultant economic crisis, this figure will surely increase.\n\nBefore I go any further into the investment proposition of Stellar Lumens, I need to make a comprehensive disclosure. Yes, I own XLM tokens, but the amount that I have now is a pittance compared to my prior holdings.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m necessarily bearish on XLM. However, when the cryptocurrency market started going sour a little over a week ago, I began taking evasive action. I converted some of my XLM holdings into BTC and some into cold hard cash.\n\nAs I watch the Stellar Lumens token tumble downward \u2013 albeit with a few head fakes here and there \u2013 I\u2019m regretting that I didn\u2019t go all into cash. Oh well. If I\u2019ve learned anything about cryptocurrencies over the years, you just never know where they might end up.\n\nExcept that I did know \u2013 at least, in my own mind. Aside from my own second guessing, the XLM price action looked weak following its trend collapse on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23. Subsequent trades have attempted to push the price back up toward 50 cents, but to no avail.\n\nCan the Stellar Lumens token recover that support level and make its way toward all-time highs? Perhaps, but that will likely depend on Bitcoin. Unfortunately, from where I stand Bitcoin looks like a basket case. Gone is the moxie that took the original virtual currency to the edge of $60,000. Instead, BTC stakeholders should consider themselves fortunate if it doesn\u2019t fall below $40,000.\n\nBelow $40K? Yeah, it can happen (though of course I\u2019m not guaranteeing it) precisely for the same reason why the cryptocurrencies started skyrocketing earlier this year: big institutions are embracing this digital revolution. They\u2019re wonderful to have when they\u2019re driving up the asset. But if these alpha dogs decide to sell, the volatility could be unprecedented.\n\nAs Bitcoin reaches down and cuts into institutional profits, you can rest assured that they\u2019ll dump like mad to preserve their wealth.\n\nThen, you also must factor in human concerns such as tax season and rising bond yields. For the former, Tax Day is approaching, which means profit taking may be in order to help ease the burden imposed by Uncle Sam.\n\nBut the latter case is the most intriguing one for me. The sudden rise in yields not only demonstrates that the incentive to hold risk-on assets is diminishing, it highlights that cryptocurrencies represent the riskiest asset class of them all. It doesn\u2019t pay dividends and it has severe third-party risk in terms of government intervention and/or cyberattacks.\n\nIf the Russians can compromise our most secure assets, then a disruptive attack on the crypto ecosystem seems like child\u2019s play.\n\nFor me, there seems to be too many questions to be comfortable wagering on Stellar Lumens right now. Personally, I\u2019d wait until Bitcoin stabilizes. If not, a low-30-cent/high-20-cent price range wouldn\u2019t be too surprising given the context.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in XLM, BTC, ETH, LTC.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

"auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Some traders assume that Bitcoin\u00a0(CCC:BTC-USD) is the gold standard among cryptocurrencies. There might be merit to that claim, but let\u2019s keep an open mind. Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) also deserves a place in your crypto portfolio \u2014 and you can buy some at a discount, as the price of Ethereum dropped hard recently.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the price is still higher than it was a year ago. Actually, you could say that about the most popular cryptocurrencies in general, since they tend to move together.\n\nSo, why should you invest in Ethereum in particular? As we\u2019ll explore, this digital token could actually exhibit a level of stability that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t.\n\nEstablishing stability is important because cryptocurrency is sometimes considered to be too speculative to take seriously as an investment. Now, let\u2019s start off with a little bit of technical analysis and see if we can detect any noteworthy price patterns.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to consider that around a year ago, during the onset of the novel coronavirus crisis, the Ethereum price actually fell below $100.\n\nIn hindsight, we now know that $100 would have been a terrific buy-up price. We might never see that price again, and prospective ETH owners must now consider whether to buy it in the quadruple digits.\n\nThe price didn\u2019t reach $1,000 in 2020, but Ethereum did achieve that milestone in early January of 2021. And on Feb. 20, the price briefly touched the important $2,000 price point.\n\nBut then, a sharp multi-day pullback happened. On the morning of March 1, the price was slightly above $1,500.\n\nThere didn\u2019t seem to be any Ethereum-specific news that would cause such a sharp price drop.\n\nEvidently, a bout of profit taking occurred within the broader cryptocurrency space, and that seems to have impacted the price of ETH.\n\nIf Bitcoin has a reputation for volatility, then perhaps Ethereum should be known as a more stable cryptocurrency.\n\nIt\u2019s true that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized digital tokens, and that they\u2019re both based on blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, ETH is known for storing smart contracts, which are basically programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAnd, according to researchers Ayana T. Aspembitova, Ling Feng and Lock Yue Chew, that\u2019s not the only thing that sets the currency apart.\n\nIn a journal article titled \u201cBehavioral structure of users in cryptocurrency market,\u201d the researchers observed behavior-based differences between the two most popular cryptocurrencies:\n\n\u201c\u2026 being the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been widely used for speculative purposes\u2026 the behavior of ethereum users is observed to be more stable as these users are more optimistic of the market. In contrast, the behavior of the bitcoin users tend to fluctuate according to the trend of the market, with a loss of optimism when the market goes down.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an outcome which some folks might not have expected. Yet, I must admit that in my observation of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, the latter token does seem to exhibit less price volatility.\n\nAnd here\u2019s some more research to add to your arsenal. As reported by Nairametrics, the number of Ethereum Percent Addresses in a state of profit was recently recorded to be 96.374%.\n\nIn other words, slightly more than 96% of the circulating ETH supply is currently in a state of profit. And, that number represents a one-month low.\n\nSo, even after a major price correction, it\u2019s probably safe to conclude that the majority of Ethereum holders are profitable. I\u2019ll acknowledge that if you chased the price near $2,000, your timing wasn\u2019t necessarily ideal.\n\nYet, there\u2019s hope for a full recovery. You should expect volatility for any cryptocurrency. Thankfully, Ethereum might be less risky than some other coins.\n\nPrice fluctuations will occur, and that\u2019s a normal part of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nIf anything, the price drop in ETH should be viewed as an opportunity. And among the most popular digital tokens, Ethereum could perhaps be a comparatively stable holding.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist,\u00a0TalkMarkets,\u00a0Finom\u00a0Group,\u00a0Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

However, this may prove to be nothing more than a counter-trend correction, as both digital assets bounce off of key support and accelerate higher. \n\nMoreover, the endorsement of the cryptocurrency market by two major investment banks, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, could further validate the digital currency market and intensify capital inflows in the near term. Citigroup\u2019s Global Perspectives and Solutions thinktank stated that Bitcoin could become \u201cthe currency of choice for international trade\u201d, while Goldman plans to offer Bitcoin futures by the middle of this month. \n\nThis comes on the back of Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s statement that it would treat BTC the same as any other financial asset and Mastercard\u2019s commitment to integrate Bitcoin into its payment network. Tesla also announced a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin and plans to begin accepting it as a form of payment. These developments will probably underpin both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the coming weeks and may even result in resumption of the primary uptrends extending from the March 2020 nadirs. Here are the key levels to watch for BTC/USD and ETH/USD.\n\nBitcoin daily chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe formation of a bullish Hammer reversal candle at the 34-EMA (45176), followed by a Bullish Engulfing candle as validation, suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s 7-day correction lower could be at an end. \n\nWith the RSI bursting back above 50, and the MACD tracking firmly above its neutral midpoint, the path of least resistance seems skewed to topside. \n\nA daily close back above psychological resistance at 50,000 would probably intensify near-term buying pressure and generate an impulsive push to retest the yearly high (58,321). Hurdling that brings the 61.8% Fibonacci (61298) and 65,000 mark into the crosshairs.\n\nHowever, if 50,000 holds firm, a more extended pullback to former resistance-turned-support at the January high (41969) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 69.56% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.28 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.46% lower than yesterday and 25.31% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 12.22% lower than yesterday and 28.40% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Bitcoin prices may continue to fall.\n\nTraders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger Bitcoin-bearish contrarian trading bias.\n\nEthereum daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nEthereum also looks set to climb higher in the coming days, as prices surge away from confluent support at the trend-defining 55-EMA and 2018 high (1424). \n\nGaining a firm foothold back above psychological resistance at 1600 would likely pave the way for buyers to retest the yearly high (2036). A daily close above is ultimately needed to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and bring the 100% Fibonacci (2410) into focus. \n\nAlternatively, a daily close below range support at 1400 \u2013 1440 could encourage would-be sellers and result in a pullback to mobile support at the 100-MA (1108). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 86.84% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 6.60 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.39% lower than yesterday and 24.39% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 16.22% lower than yesterday and 21.72% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Ethereum prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed Ethereum trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin (BTC/USD), Ethereum (ETH/USD) Rallying Sharply as the Bulls Wrestle Back Control", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/N8NkPHuyCUNK.Mw1v5Swtg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/ed541f1965e6c7bb14b43c8cfe11bed2", "auther": "Nick Cawley", "body": "A sea of green in the cryptocurrency space with some coins recording early double-digit gains. Last week\u2019s sell-off has been absorbed and the technical picture for both Bitcoin and Ethereum now looks increasingly positive. As always with the cryptocurrency, the real reason for the move is never immediately clear although a few recent actions are likely to be put forward as drivers of the recent move. A recent tweet by the CEO of a South Korean crypto-analytics firm that the large Bitcoin trades recently indicate OTC-buying by cryptocurrency \u2018whales\u2019 will have buoyed the bulls, while Goldman Sachs is said to be firing up its cryptocurrency trading desk again and will begin trading bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards. In addition, cryptocurrency miner, publicly-quoted Argo Blockchain, today said that it will pay its CEO in Bitcoin and allow other employees to be in Bitcoin if they wish.\n\nWhile in isolation these events may not spark a strong move, in combination they continue to point to increased adoption and interest in the space, a space that needs little news to spark a strong move. Emotion is a strong driver in the cryptocurrency market and if the recent move has taken out selling interest, then a fresh move higher looks the path of least resistance.\n\nHow to Manage the Emotions of Trading\n\nA look at the daily charts suggests that the recent sell-off is being pared back and if BTC/USD can regain its bullish channel, fresh all-time highs are likely.The CCI reading shows Bitcoin landed in oversold territory recently for the first time since late-January, with the previous oversold reading back in September 2020 when BTC traded around $10,000. It looks as though oversold signals have been drivers of strong rallies. The bullish channel is steep and BTC/USD will likely have to make a fresh all-time high to regain it.\n\nEthereum (ETH/USD) continues its pullback from the late-February sell-off and is looking to re-test $1,700 and potentially higher. Again the CCI indicator highlighted heavily oversold conditions, while the 50-day simple moving average helped to stem the sell-off and if closed and opened above will turn into stronger support. The next area of resistance lies between $1,700 and $1,780 before the February 20 high of $2,036 comes into play.\n\nTraders of all levels and abilities will find something to help them make more informed decisions in the new and improved DailyFX Trading Education Centre\n\nWhat are your views on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 bullish or bearish??

Back then, cryptocurrencies tumbled a combined 81%, wiping out almost $600 billion in market capitalization and sending Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and other altcoins on a multi-year recovery journey few want to relive.\n\nThis time however, looks slightly different. Bitcoin has far wider adoption, particularly among payment processors like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ). And high-profile thefts have also become rarer as security has improved. That makes Bitcoin far more likely to stay relevant, even as prices gyrate.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s stability comes at the expense of more limited upside. The cryptocurrency\u2019s $800 billion market cap already makes it the fifth-largest currency in the world. A doubling would make it as large as the U.S. Dollar, while 10x growth would make it more valuable than all the physical gold ever mined.\n\nThat means investors looking for the next 100x cryptocurrency need to look at altcoins \u2014 smaller cryptocurrencies that still have a chance of making it big. Because when you\u2019re buying a currency worth $10 billion, there\u2019s a far better chance of considerable gains ahead.\n\nBitcoin itself is a technological dinosaur relative to other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain transactions, for instance, cost $15 to perform and takes ten minutes to confirm.\n\nBut as the first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has maintained its lead thanks to a strong community and widespread adoption. That means successful altcoins will need far more than minor technological improvements. Bitcoin Cash, for instance, remains 80% beneath its all-time highs despite having a higher transaction per second limit than its predecessor.\n\nInstead, successful altcoins will look much more like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), a long-time favorite altcoin:\n\nAltcoins aren\u2019t necessarily for everyone. Even the most promising will stumble if programming flaws emerge \u2014 and significant initial coin offerings (ICOs) are often notoriously overpriced, leading to long-term underperformance.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s shadow will still loom over the crypto landscape, here are five promising altcoins every investor should know:\n\nAltcoins that gain scale could pose a threat to Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. The legacy cryptocurrency still relies on third parties to batch orders and act as a middleman to overcome Bitcoin\u2019s cost and lack of speed. The next generation of coins promises to perform these tasks independently. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n \n\nCardano remains one of the most advanced general-use altcoins on the market. This third-generation coin uses a proof-of-stake system, compared with the standard proof-of-work. That makes the system far more efficient than Bitcoin and faster as well.\n\nThe Cardano Foundation also has an all-star team running the show. The currency was started in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, and retains an active development community. Today, the team is led by digital payments veteran Frederik Gregaard, an old hand who once led PwC\u2019s Digital Financial Services division.\n\nADA, the currency run on the Cardano Network, has already advanced 4,400% since its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. As the currency gains greater exposure, investors ae now seeing price targets of $10 start appearing \u2014 significant upside for a coin available for less than $1 today.\n\n \n\nPolkadot was founded by another alum of the Ethereum Project \u2014 Chief Technology Officer Gavin Wood. And this altcoin takes an entirely different approach to cryptocurrencies.\n\nRather than host a single ever-growing blockchain, Polkadot uses parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that run in parallel. That solves Bitcoin\u2019s problem of managing a single ledger \u2014 one that\u2019s already over 320 GB in size.\n\nThe altcoin has seen spectacular growth since its August 2020 launch through efforts like Polkastarter, a decentralized exchange built on Polkadot. Projects have even started attracting attention from Gemini crypto exchange founders the Winklevoss twins, as well as many high-profile sports celebrities.\n\nThat makes DOT, the currency on Polkadot, one to watch closely for 2021. The currency has already grown tenfold. But with a $30 billion market cap, there\u2019s still room for this promising altcoin to run.\n\n \n\nRipple (CCC:XRP-USD) co-founder Jed McCaleb started Stellar in 2014 as an altcoin alternative to XRP. The cryptocurrency facilitates cross-border transactions by using a protocol developed by Stanford professor David Mazi\u00e8res.\n\nThe system itself uses a trusted network, where each person running the software identifies other trusted partners to confirm transactions. That removes the need for the expensive cryptographic mining Bitcoin relies on to validate transactions.\n\nStellar\u2019s fundamental reason for growth however, has more to do with rival XRP\u2019s fall. In December, the SEC charged Ripple and two executives with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering. Around half of all XRP is still owned by founding company Ripple Networks, and its ICOs triggered regulatory red flags.\n\nMeanwhile Stellar has stepped in to fill XRP\u2019s role. Its system of using trusted partners makes it an ideal replacement for quickly moving money between banks. And with a coin price less than $0.40, Stellar is a currency that could still grow many times over.\n\n \n\nCelsius is a smaller cryptocurrency focused on lending and borrowing. Interest rates for would-be borrowers start at just 1% APR, while depositors earn interest on cryptocurrency that would otherwise sit in a stagnant account. Interest rates can rise as high as 15.85% for stablecoins like Tether.\n\nCelsius Network has also wisely registered as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2018, making it far less likely to run into regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe system looks particularly promising thanks to its ease of use. Savers can transfer their entire cryptocurrency account to Celsius Network \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum and all \u2014 without converting to any proprietary coin. And borrowers can take out loans by depositing cryptocurrency, avoiding the need to cash out.\n\nThere are risks of course. An investigation by Coindesk found instances of uncollateralized lending by the network, where a borrower default would leave either Celsius Networks or P2P lenders with irreversible losses. And there\u2019s always a temptation to make riskier loans that earn higher interest payments.\n\nA sudden drop in collateral values (i.e., cryptocurrencies) can also have a knock-on effect to Celsius\u2019 value. As of writing, Celsius requires a 2.7 ETH deposit to borrow $1,000. At today\u2019s crypto prices, a borrower should willingly repay the loan to retrieve their collateral. If ETH prices plummet however, the same person might instead decide to walk away with the money, leaving Celsius investors hoping that the Network hedged its bets.\n\nNevertheless, Celsius shows a great deal of promise. CEL is highly differentiated from Bitcoin, and investment risks will decline as cryptocurrency prices eventually stabilize.\n\n \n\nInvestors might have written off Neo long ago. The China-based cryptocurrency (formerly known as Antshares) went into a tailspin back in 2018 when the Chinese Central Government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. The currency remains almost 80% down from its all-time highs.\n\nYet change is on the horizon. In April last year, the Chinese authorities began a limited rollout of e-yuan, a government-backed cryptocurrency. People expect the CCP to expand the program during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nMuch of this change comes from a recognition that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. And rather than allow outside players like Bitcoin and Ethereum to push finance out of the CCP\u2019s sight, they have started embracing home-grown cryptocurrencies as alternatives.\n\nSmaller Chinese-based cryptocurrencies have already started emerging. VeChain, another promising cryptocurrency, helps Chinese companies with supply-chain management.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to know if the CCP will also anoint Neo a cryptocurrency champion, there\u2019s phenomenal upside to be had if they do.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin\u2019s Nosedive below $45,000 Can Open Way to Continued Correction, Ethereum\u2019s Repeats after...", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/_vAsLCzb6bVpoG_f0ZCrrg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/b76915b30c62f709fbe1d1291f267707", "auther": "Anissimov Konstantin", "body": "BTC/USD started the week at 57,499 near the all-time high at 58,400, based on the CEX.IOpricing. In the first four hours of Monday\u2019s trading session, BTC/USD declined to 56,000, which was an important support level in intraday terms. The level produced some buying pressure for the pair but only for the next four hours, as BTC/USD closed the 4-hour candlestick between 04:00 and 08:00 UTC at 46,479.\n\nThat, however, made no lasting influence, and BTC/USD had broken down below 56,000 and dropped below 53,500 by 16:00 UTC. That was a signal for a big sale, as the Bitcoin market had been overheated. In confirmation of that hypothesis, BTC/USD made a huge rollercoaster swing in the interval between 13:00 and 15:00 UTC, falling from 53,677 to 47,400 and bouncing back up. Meanwhile, Glassnode, an on-chain data aggregator reported that high-net-worth Bitcoin holders had sold 140,000 BTC, which was proof of traders\u2019 readiness to sell BTC/USD big time. There was a slight upside recovery to 56,000 at the end of Monday, but with the start of Tuesday\u2019s session the selling went on.\n\nBy 09:00 UTC of Tuesday, 23rd February, BTC/USD had already been at 46,500 as per Bitstamp\u2019s exchange rate. Form 09:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued sideways, with high volatility taking place in the price action. The pair was edging sideways within the corridor of 45,000 \u2013 49,000 until 01:00 UTC of Wednesday, 24th February. At that time a rebound above 49,000 started to take place and continued until 05:00 UTC, with 51,000 topped out.\n\nThe volatility reduced considerably, as the pair continued edging sideways within the price range of 50,000 \u2013 51,000. At 13:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, a drawdown to 49,000 happened; afterwards, BTC/USD continued between 48,000 \u2013 50,000 until the end of Wednesday. The sideways fluctuations continued on Thursday, 25th February, until 12:00 UTC. At 12:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, BTC/USD bounced to 52,000. Afterwards, BTC/USD began another continued downfall, which continued to 45,000 on Friday, 26th February. The falling stopped at 08:00 UTC, as the zone offered a buying opportunity.\n\nBTC/USD had bounced to 48,265 by 17:00 UTC and then reversed downwards until 23:00 UTC, almost reaching 45,000, and closed Friday at 45,447. On Saturday, 27th February, BTC/USD the bulls continued supporting the trading pair with buying volumes, and BTC/USD briefly rose to 48,100 between 0200 \u2013 02:45 UTC. The pair continued sideways until 07:00 UTC, once breaking above the 50-period hourly SMA, but was eventually driven down below 47,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC. The upside attempts at the SMA continued unsuccessfully until the end of Saturday. On Sunday, 28th February, selling pressure increased and saw BTC/USD gradually head down to 43,067 at its lowest. The capitalisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was an indication of continuing selling bias in the trading pair.\n\nThere was some news in the week of 22nd February that kept up Bitcoin bulls\u2019 hopes of an upside recovery. Square, Inc. that had invested $50,000 million in Bitcoin in October 2020 made another Bitcoin purchase worth $170 million on 24th February 2021. Besides that, MicroStrategy \u2013 the corporate frontrunner among Bitcoin investors \u2013 bought 19,452 more BTC worth $1.026 billion at an average price of $52,765. This new purchase had brought MicroStrategy\u2019s exposure to Bitcoin to 90,531 BTC.\n\nThese tendencies clearly showed that high profile investors were happy with the Bitcoin drawdown and were ready to buy the dip. This shows that Bitcoin continues to be looked upon as a solid financial instrument, and every downside correction is going to be met with substantial buying volumes.\n\nThe decline to nearly 43,000 and a stabilisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was a signal of continuing bearish bias in BTC/USD, promising lower lows. Still, some bullish momentum remains to be present, and a breakthrough above 48,000 and above the 50-period 4-hour SMA would signal a change of bias and an upside recovery gaining traction. On the contrary, another decline to 43,000 will mean a continuation of bearish price action, with prospects of getting back to testing the 31,000 support level.\n\nTherefore, we shall soon get answers on where BTC/USD will go next. With the pair edging higher towards 48,000 in the morning hours of Monday, the odds for a breakthrough are presently going higher.\n\nETH/USD opened the week of 22nd February at 1,933.4 and headed straight down from the start of the day, briefly getting below the 50-period 4-hour SMA with the lower wick of Monday\u2019s first 4-hour candlestick reaching 1,867.3. The SMA gave ETH/USD some transitory support, but it continued sinking lower until 09:00 UTC on Tuesday, 23rd February, with support being found at 1,440. The trading pair continued sideways until the end of Tuesday, fluctuating within a considerable range of 1,360 and 1,600.\n\nFrom the start of Wednesday, 24th February, the ETH/USD trading pair headed upwards to reach 1,715 and break above the 50-period hourly SMA. The volatility shrank considerably, as ETH/USD spent most of the time until 18:00 UTC on Thursday, 25th February within the range of 1,586.4 \u2013 1,662, being regularly supported by the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nETH/USD, ETH/USD headed down from 18:00 UTC on Thursday through to 08:00 UTC on Friday, 26th February. The pair eventually hit 1,402 at the minimum and continued edging sideways between 1,424.7 and 1,560 until the end of Saturday, 27th February, with the 50-period hourly SMA upkeeping the ETH/USD bearish momentum.\n\nAnother downswing took place on Sunday, 28th February, with a minimum at 1,299.6. However, an upside recovery that began at 19:00 UTC and continued through to the end of Sunday, with the 1,392.2 support level letting ETH/USD close the week at 1,417.5 as per the CEX.IO pricing. On top of that, ETH/USD finished Sunday in a hammer candlestick on the daily timeframe, which coupled with the 1,420 support level gives increased potential for a full-fledged upside recovery in the near term.\n\nIt became known that the intraday pullback in ETH/USD between Tuesday, 23rd February, and Wednesday, 24th February, from the mid-to-lower 1,400s to above 1,700 coincided with a purchase of 10,000 ETH by Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which brought its Ether exposure to 3.17 ETH.\n\nThe bullish market reaction to the purchase clearly shows that big players\u2019 moves have a strong impact on the Ethereum market. And the purchase itself shows that high-profile investors, who constitute most of Grayscale clients, have trust in Ethereum in the long term, which can result in continued market growth for the smart-contract pioneer.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Continues to Show Strength \n-  S&P 500 Price Forecast \u2013 Stock Markets Recover on Monday \n-  Target Has Strong Upside Potential; Likely to Log Over 50% Jump in Q4 Profit \n-  GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues Noisy Behavior \n-  GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Gives up Early Gains \n-  Stocks Move Higher At The Start Of The Month \n"}, {"headline": "BTC/USD stagnates under 50,000, ETH/USD sinks under 1,500", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/1.CMBbcF7Ty_T6LdBMUGSg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3163aad28e8c2f2b8cadc514cd079893", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "BTC/USD made a bullish attack at 50,000 early on 2nd March, but it was swiftly curbed by the mark, with the pair finding itself under 48,000 at the end of the day. Buying pressure was still there, but more buying volumes might be required for a pullback above 50,000 to come through.\n\nBTC/USD opened 2nd March at 49,720 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair edged above 50,000 in the first hour but found itself at 49,556 at the hour\u2019s close. An intraday retracement took the pair to 48,354 at 08:00 UTC. Having risen above 49,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC, the pair continued sideways until 16:00, clinging to the 49,000 handle. By 16:00 UTC, a head-and-shoulders-looking pattern had formed and was confirmed with a bearish candlestick between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC that landed on 47,500 and the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nThe moving average did support the price, signaling some lack of confidence of the bears and the presence of buying appetite. The pair continued trending mildly upwards, consistently leaning on the 50-period hourly moving average until 19:00 UTC, but slipped below it at 20:00 UTC.\n\nThe failure of the breakthrough above 50,000, should extend the expectations of an exit out the horizontal channel between 43,000 and 50,000. The update on corporate and institutional holdings from Bitcointreasuries.com on the day showed that the cumulative figure had reached 1.36 million BTC worth around $65 billion at the time. This is an apparent sign of continuing demand for Bitcoin from high-profile investors. Considering their traditional long-term investment fashion, their demand might play a key role in Bitcoin\u2019s financial maturity.\n\nETH/USD spent most of the trading session of 2nd March between 1,540 and 1,580. Selling pressure increased at 16:00 UTC, and the trading pair slipped to under 1,500 in the day\u2019s later hours.\u00a0\n\nETH/USD started 2nd March at 1,572 and produced a sharp spike to 1,600. But the buying volumes were too small, and the pair quickly got back to 1,570, continuing sideways between 1,540 and 1,580 for the most part until 16:00 UTC. Between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, ETH/USD broke down below 1,540 and closed the hour at 1,503.5 based on the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair was consistently heading down afterwards and slipped to 1,460 \u2013 1,480 in the period between 20:00 \u2013 23:00 UTC.\n\nMeanwhile, The Block shows that Ethereum miners set a new record for monthly earnings in February 2021, having earned $1.37 billion during the 28-day-long month. Of those, $772.78 million were transaction fees and $644.4 million were block rewards, which is the first precedent of transaction fees dominating block rewards in Ethereum miners\u2019 revenues on a monthly basis in all of Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nThis shows how much demand is going on for Ethereum as a means of transfer of value, the DeFi market probably being the biggest driver of that demand, as its market capitalisation grew to 71.87 billion, according to CoinGecko, as of 2nd March. Also, the anticipation of the transition of Ethereum to the PoS Beacon Chain is heating up demand for Ether as a means of passive income: according to The Block, the ETH 2.0 deposit contract had 3.33 million ETH on 2nd March.\n\nETH/USD might have found a resting point between 1,460 \u2013 1,570 and may continue sideways on shrinking volatility for a while before taking a turn outside this corridor. The 1,392 daily support level can be a source of resurging buying pressure for ETH/USD in the scenario of a gradual decline.\n"}, {"headline": "Kings of Leon NFT Album: 17 Things to Know as the Rock Album Goes Digital", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/bsE5E5QZ6y_tR2wjagS_8g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/9d4966ecff929dbfd34f5681bdb729ff", "auther": "Vivian Medithi ", "body": "American rock band Kings of Leon have announced their next album will be released as a non-fungible token (NFT) this Friday, just the latest high-profile digital collectible coming to market at a time of skyrocketing interest in cryptoassets.\n\n \n\nHere\u2019s what investors should know about the new album, \u201cNFT Yourself,\u201d coming out Friday, March 5:\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH uptrend to $2,000 in grave danger amid flashing sell signals", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/REIeQHMAYcmTIXjf3ot2qQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bfcbe8c59e51f681a528c61f971e9894", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Ethereum's technical breakout on Monday had a target close to $1,700, but the price recovery failed to overcome the barrier at $1,600. A correction is underway with Ether struggling to hold above $1,500.\n\nEthereum gas fees is exorbitantly high, but the situation has become a norm. Over the last 30 to 60 days, the fee used to make transactions on the network increased significantly. While the gas averages at $12, there are instances where it swells three to four times.\n\nHowever, Santiment's data reveals that a spike in the gas fees usually lasts an average of 30 to 60 minutes. What is intriguing is that the upswings in the gas tend to coincide with Ether's local price bottoms and short-term bounce backs.\n\n\n\nEthereum average fees (21 days)\n\nNote that this finding is not conclusive but gives an insight into the gas fee spikes, which could be triggered by panic selloffs in conjunction with 'paper hand' capitulation. A buy the dip pressure then results in Ethereum's short-term bottom and a pullback.\n\nEther is trading at $1,545 and flirting with the 50 Simple Moving Average (SMA). The breakout from the falling wedge pattern suggested that the liftoff will hit levels close to $1,700. Moreover, a step above the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) could trigger more buy orders as investors anticipate a return to highs above $2,000.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nMeanwhile, failing to hold above the 50 SMA on the 4-hour chart would be a bearish signal. Panic-selling will increase the overhead pressure, forcing Ethereum to explore downhill levels toward $1,200.\n\nNotably, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal in the form of a green nine candlestick. The bearish signal comes at a time when the uptrend is in jeopardy. If validated, the pioneer altcoin will fall in one to four 4-hour candlesticks, adding credibility to the bearish narrative.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe uptrend will be secured if Ethereum manages to hold onto the 50 SMA support on the 4-hour chart. Besides, the falling wedge pattern's impact is still in the picture, and with a small boost, ETH could swing to highs above $1,700. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has a bullish impulse, which could keep buyer interest high.\n"}, {"headline": "Stellar Lumens Is Impressive as a Technology But Not Currently as a Trade", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jDGEk7m07GGEvjcDeE4_KQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/c29b5e8f640f2124ee5501dc12ec92d4", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "As a fundamental fintech innovation, it\u2019s hard not get excited about Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) and its underlying blockchain technology. While we have increasingly become a digitalization-of-everything economy, our payment processing solutions remain curiously archaic. Stellar offers a viable alternative but does that necessarily bode well for its XLM cryptocurrency token?\n\n \n\nI\u2019m going to dive into the nuances of this question. But first, I believe the integration of the Stellar Lumens blockchain technology into mainstream financial institutions should be encouraged. And at some point, you\u2019d figure that this staid industry will be forced to accept that we live in the 21st century.\n\nRecently, I had the displeasure of having to make a wire transfer to another U.S.-based bank. The cost to me was $25 to make the transfer. Additionally, the time it took for the wire transfer to process, along with associated filings was about one week \u2013 that\u2019s an eternity in our supposedly advanced society.\n\nOn the flipside, cryptocurrency transactions occur much quicker and cheaper. Earlier this year, I made several Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) transactions, with the process taking a few hours to complete and with transaction fees in the single-digit dollar range.\n\nHowever, crypto proponents consider Bitcoin as the transactional laggard in this space. Other cryptocurrency transactions, such as through the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) or Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) blockchains occur at lightning-fast speeds and with more modest fees.\n\nAnd this is where Stellar Lumens truly shines. The platform is one of the fastest. Better yet, because of its low flat fees, Stellar opens the door to a viable micropayments economy. In turn, this will help bring the developing part of the world into the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nPlus, we don\u2019t even have to think so globally. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 5.4% or roughly 7.1 million households were unbanked in 2019. Due to the pandemic and the resultant economic crisis, this figure will surely increase.\n\nBefore I go any further into the investment proposition of Stellar Lumens, I need to make a comprehensive disclosure. Yes, I own XLM tokens, but the amount that I have now is a pittance compared to my prior holdings.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m necessarily bearish on XLM. However, when the cryptocurrency market started going sour a little over a week ago, I began taking evasive action. I converted some of my XLM holdings into BTC and some into cold hard cash.\n\nAs I watch the Stellar Lumens token tumble downward \u2013 albeit with a few head fakes here and there \u2013 I\u2019m regretting that I didn\u2019t go all into cash. Oh well. If I\u2019ve learned anything about cryptocurrencies over the years, you just never know where they might end up.\n\nExcept that I did know \u2013 at least, in my own mind. Aside from my own second guessing, the XLM price action looked weak following its trend collapse on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23. Subsequent trades have attempted to push the price back up toward 50 cents, but to no avail.\n\nCan the Stellar Lumens token recover that support level and make its way toward all-time highs? Perhaps, but that will likely depend on Bitcoin. Unfortunately, from where I stand Bitcoin looks like a basket case. Gone is the moxie that took the original virtual currency to the edge of $60,000. Instead, BTC stakeholders should consider themselves fortunate if it doesn\u2019t fall below $40,000.\n\nBelow $40K? Yeah, it can happen (though of course I\u2019m not guaranteeing it) precisely for the same reason why the cryptocurrencies started skyrocketing earlier this year: big institutions are embracing this digital revolution. They\u2019re wonderful to have when they\u2019re driving up the asset. But if these alpha dogs decide to sell, the volatility could be unprecedented.\n\nAs Bitcoin reaches down and cuts into institutional profits, you can rest assured that they\u2019ll dump like mad to preserve their wealth.\n\nThen, you also must factor in human concerns such as tax season and rising bond yields. For the former, Tax Day is approaching, which means profit taking may be in order to help ease the burden imposed by Uncle Sam.\n\nBut the latter case is the most intriguing one for me. The sudden rise in yields not only demonstrates that the incentive to hold risk-on assets is diminishing, it highlights that cryptocurrencies represent the riskiest asset class of them all. It doesn\u2019t pay dividends and it has severe third-party risk in terms of government intervention and/or cyberattacks.\n\nIf the Russians can compromise our most secure assets, then a disruptive attack on the crypto ecosystem seems like child\u2019s play.\n\nFor me, there seems to be too many questions to be comfortable wagering on Stellar Lumens right now. Personally, I\u2019d wait until Bitcoin stabilizes. If not, a low-30-cent/high-20-cent price range wouldn\u2019t be too surprising given the context.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in XLM, BTC, ETH, LTC.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

"auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Some traders assume that Bitcoin\u00a0(CCC:BTC-USD) is the gold standard among cryptocurrencies. There might be merit to that claim, but let\u2019s keep an open mind. Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) also deserves a place in your crypto portfolio \u2014 and you can buy some at a discount, as the price of Ethereum dropped hard recently.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the price is still higher than it was a year ago. Actually, you could say that about the most popular cryptocurrencies in general, since they tend to move together.\n\nSo, why should you invest in Ethereum in particular? As we\u2019ll explore, this digital token could actually exhibit a level of stability that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t.\n\nEstablishing stability is important because cryptocurrency is sometimes considered to be too speculative to take seriously as an investment. Now, let\u2019s start off with a little bit of technical analysis and see if we can detect any noteworthy price patterns.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to consider that around a year ago, during the onset of the novel coronavirus crisis, the Ethereum price actually fell below $100.\n\nIn hindsight, we now know that $100 would have been a terrific buy-up price. We might never see that price again, and prospective ETH owners must now consider whether to buy it in the quadruple digits.\n\nThe price didn\u2019t reach $1,000 in 2020, but Ethereum did achieve that milestone in early January of 2021. And on Feb. 20, the price briefly touched the important $2,000 price point.\n\nBut then, a sharp multi-day pullback happened. On the morning of March 1, the price was slightly above $1,500.\n\nThere didn\u2019t seem to be any Ethereum-specific news that would cause such a sharp price drop.\n\nEvidently, a bout of profit taking occurred within the broader cryptocurrency space, and that seems to have impacted the price of ETH.\n\nIf Bitcoin has a reputation for volatility, then perhaps Ethereum should be known as a more stable cryptocurrency.\n\nIt\u2019s true that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized digital tokens, and that they\u2019re both based on blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, ETH is known for storing smart contracts, which are basically programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAnd, according to researchers Ayana T. Aspembitova, Ling Feng and Lock Yue Chew, that\u2019s not the only thing that sets the currency apart.\n\nIn a journal article titled \u201cBehavioral structure of users in cryptocurrency market,\u201d the researchers observed behavior-based differences between the two most popular cryptocurrencies:\n\n\u201c\u2026 being the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been widely used for speculative purposes\u2026 the behavior of ethereum users is observed to be more stable as these users are more optimistic of the market. In contrast, the behavior of the bitcoin users tend to fluctuate according to the trend of the market, with a loss of optimism when the market goes down.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an outcome which some folks might not have expected. Yet, I must admit that in my observation of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, the latter token does seem to exhibit less price volatility.\n\nAnd here\u2019s some more research to add to your arsenal. As reported by Nairametrics, the number of Ethereum Percent Addresses in a state of profit was recently recorded to be 96.374%.\n\nIn other words, slightly more than 96% of the circulating ETH supply is currently in a state of profit. And, that number represents a one-month low.\n\nSo, even after a major price correction, it\u2019s probably safe to conclude that the majority of Ethereum holders are profitable. I\u2019ll acknowledge that if you chased the price near $2,000, your timing wasn\u2019t necessarily ideal.\n\nYet, there\u2019s hope for a full recovery. You should expect volatility for any cryptocurrency. Thankfully, Ethereum might be less risky than some other coins.\n\nPrice fluctuations will occur, and that\u2019s a normal part of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nIf anything, the price drop in ETH should be viewed as an opportunity. And among the most popular digital tokens, Ethereum could perhaps be a comparatively stable holding.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist,\u00a0TalkMarkets,\u00a0Finom\u00a0Group,\u00a0Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

However, this may prove to be nothing more than a counter-trend correction, as both digital assets bounce off of key support and accelerate higher. \n\nMoreover, the endorsement of the cryptocurrency market by two major investment banks, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, could further validate the digital currency market and intensify capital inflows in the near term. Citigroup\u2019s Global Perspectives and Solutions thinktank stated that Bitcoin could become \u201cthe currency of choice for international trade\u201d, while Goldman plans to offer Bitcoin futures by the middle of this month. \n\nThis comes on the back of Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s statement that it would treat BTC the same as any other financial asset and Mastercard\u2019s commitment to integrate Bitcoin into its payment network. Tesla also announced a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin and plans to begin accepting it as a form of payment. These developments will probably underpin both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the coming weeks and may even result in resumption of the primary uptrends extending from the March 2020 nadirs. Here are the key levels to watch for BTC/USD and ETH/USD.\n\nBitcoin daily chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe formation of a bullish Hammer reversal candle at the 34-EMA (45176), followed by a Bullish Engulfing candle as validation, suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s 7-day correction lower could be at an end. \n\nWith the RSI bursting back above 50, and the MACD tracking firmly above its neutral midpoint, the path of least resistance seems skewed to topside. \n\nA daily close back above psychological resistance at 50,000 would probably intensify near-term buying pressure and generate an impulsive push to retest the yearly high (58,321). Hurdling that brings the 61.8% Fibonacci (61298) and 65,000 mark into the crosshairs.\n\nHowever, if 50,000 holds firm, a more extended pullback to former resistance-turned-support at the January high (41969) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 69.56% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.28 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.46% lower than yesterday and 25.31% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 12.22% lower than yesterday and 28.40% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Bitcoin prices may continue to fall.\n\nTraders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger Bitcoin-bearish contrarian trading bias.\n\nEthereum daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nEthereum also looks set to climb higher in the coming days, as prices surge away from confluent support at the trend-defining 55-EMA and 2018 high (1424). \n\nGaining a firm foothold back above psychological resistance at 1600 would likely pave the way for buyers to retest the yearly high (2036). A daily close above is ultimately needed to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and bring the 100% Fibonacci (2410) into focus. \n\nAlternatively, a daily close below range support at 1400 \u2013 1440 could encourage would-be sellers and result in a pullback to mobile support at the 100-MA (1108). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 86.84% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 6.60 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.39% lower than yesterday and 24.39% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 16.22% lower than yesterday and 21.72% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Ethereum prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed Ethereum trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin (BTC/USD), Ethereum (ETH/USD) Rallying Sharply as the Bulls Wrestle Back Control", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/N8NkPHuyCUNK.Mw1v5Swtg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/ed541f1965e6c7bb14b43c8cfe11bed2", "auther": "Nick Cawley", "body": "A sea of green in the cryptocurrency space with some coins recording early double-digit gains. Last week\u2019s sell-off has been absorbed and the technical picture for both Bitcoin and Ethereum now looks increasingly positive. As always with the cryptocurrency, the real reason for the move is never immediately clear although a few recent actions are likely to be put forward as drivers of the recent move. A recent tweet by the CEO of a South Korean crypto-analytics firm that the large Bitcoin trades recently indicate OTC-buying by cryptocurrency \u2018whales\u2019 will have buoyed the bulls, while Goldman Sachs is said to be firing up its cryptocurrency trading desk again and will begin trading bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards. In addition, cryptocurrency miner, publicly-quoted Argo Blockchain, today said that it will pay its CEO in Bitcoin and allow other employees to be in Bitcoin if they wish.\n\nWhile in isolation these events may not spark a strong move, in combination they continue to point to increased adoption and interest in the space, a space that needs little news to spark a strong move. Emotion is a strong driver in the cryptocurrency market and if the recent move has taken out selling interest, then a fresh move higher looks the path of least resistance.\n\nHow to Manage the Emotions of Trading\n\nA look at the daily charts suggests that the recent sell-off is being pared back and if BTC/USD can regain its bullish channel, fresh all-time highs are likely.The CCI reading shows Bitcoin landed in oversold territory recently for the first time since late-January, with the previous oversold reading back in September 2020 when BTC traded around $10,000. It looks as though oversold signals have been drivers of strong rallies. The bullish channel is steep and BTC/USD will likely have to make a fresh all-time high to regain it.\n\nEthereum (ETH/USD) continues its pullback from the late-February sell-off and is looking to re-test $1,700 and potentially higher. Again the CCI indicator highlighted heavily oversold conditions, while the 50-day simple moving average helped to stem the sell-off and if closed and opened above will turn into stronger support. The next area of resistance lies between $1,700 and $1,780 before the February 20 high of $2,036 comes into play.\n\nTraders of all levels and abilities will find something to help them make more informed decisions in the new and improved DailyFX Trading Education Centre\n\nWhat are your views on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 bullish or bearish??

Back then, cryptocurrencies tumbled a combined 81%, wiping out almost $600 billion in market capitalization and sending Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and other altcoins on a multi-year recovery journey few want to relive.\n\nThis time however, looks slightly different. Bitcoin has far wider adoption, particularly among payment processors like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ). And high-profile thefts have also become rarer as security has improved. That makes Bitcoin far more likely to stay relevant, even as prices gyrate.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s stability comes at the expense of more limited upside. The cryptocurrency\u2019s $800 billion market cap already makes it the fifth-largest currency in the world. A doubling would make it as large as the U.S. Dollar, while 10x growth would make it more valuable than all the physical gold ever mined.\n\nThat means investors looking for the next 100x cryptocurrency need to look at altcoins \u2014 smaller cryptocurrencies that still have a chance of making it big. Because when you\u2019re buying a currency worth $10 billion, there\u2019s a far better chance of considerable gains ahead.\n\nBitcoin itself is a technological dinosaur relative to other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain transactions, for instance, cost $15 to perform and takes ten minutes to confirm.\n\nBut as the first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has maintained its lead thanks to a strong community and widespread adoption. That means successful altcoins will need far more than minor technological improvements. Bitcoin Cash, for instance, remains 80% beneath its all-time highs despite having a higher transaction per second limit than its predecessor.\n\nInstead, successful altcoins will look much more like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), a long-time favorite altcoin:\n\nAltcoins aren\u2019t necessarily for everyone. Even the most promising will stumble if programming flaws emerge \u2014 and significant initial coin offerings (ICOs) are often notoriously overpriced, leading to long-term underperformance.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s shadow will still loom over the crypto landscape, here are five promising altcoins every investor should know:\n\nAltcoins that gain scale could pose a threat to Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. The legacy cryptocurrency still relies on third parties to batch orders and act as a middleman to overcome Bitcoin\u2019s cost and lack of speed. The next generation of coins promises to perform these tasks independently. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n \n\nCardano remains one of the most advanced general-use altcoins on the market. This third-generation coin uses a proof-of-stake system, compared with the standard proof-of-work. That makes the system far more efficient than Bitcoin and faster as well.\n\nThe Cardano Foundation also has an all-star team running the show. The currency was started in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, and retains an active development community. Today, the team is led by digital payments veteran Frederik Gregaard, an old hand who once led PwC\u2019s Digital Financial Services division.\n\nADA, the currency run on the Cardano Network, has already advanced 4,400% since its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. As the currency gains greater exposure, investors ae now seeing price targets of $10 start appearing \u2014 significant upside for a coin available for less than $1 today.\n\n \n\nPolkadot was founded by another alum of the Ethereum Project \u2014 Chief Technology Officer Gavin Wood. And this altcoin takes an entirely different approach to cryptocurrencies.\n\nRather than host a single ever-growing blockchain, Polkadot uses parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that run in parallel. That solves Bitcoin\u2019s problem of managing a single ledger \u2014 one that\u2019s already over 320 GB in size.\n\nThe altcoin has seen spectacular growth since its August 2020 launch through efforts like Polkastarter, a decentralized exchange built on Polkadot. Projects have even started attracting attention from Gemini crypto exchange founders the Winklevoss twins, as well as many high-profile sports celebrities.\n\nThat makes DOT, the currency on Polkadot, one to watch closely for 2021. The currency has already grown tenfold. But with a $30 billion market cap, there\u2019s still room for this promising altcoin to run.\n\n \n\nRipple (CCC:XRP-USD) co-founder Jed McCaleb started Stellar in 2014 as an altcoin alternative to XRP. The cryptocurrency facilitates cross-border transactions by using a protocol developed by Stanford professor David Mazi\u00e8res.\n\nThe system itself uses a trusted network, where each person running the software identifies other trusted partners to confirm transactions. That removes the need for the expensive cryptographic mining Bitcoin relies on to validate transactions.\n\nStellar\u2019s fundamental reason for growth however, has more to do with rival XRP\u2019s fall. In December, the SEC charged Ripple and two executives with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering. Around half of all XRP is still owned by founding company Ripple Networks, and its ICOs triggered regulatory red flags.\n\nMeanwhile Stellar has stepped in to fill XRP\u2019s role. Its system of using trusted partners makes it an ideal replacement for quickly moving money between banks. And with a coin price less than $0.40, Stellar is a currency that could still grow many times over.\n\n \n\nCelsius is a smaller cryptocurrency focused on lending and borrowing. Interest rates for would-be borrowers start at just 1% APR, while depositors earn interest on cryptocurrency that would otherwise sit in a stagnant account. Interest rates can rise as high as 15.85% for stablecoins like Tether.\n\nCelsius Network has also wisely registered as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2018, making it far less likely to run into regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe system looks particularly promising thanks to its ease of use. Savers can transfer their entire cryptocurrency account to Celsius Network \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum and all \u2014 without converting to any proprietary coin. And borrowers can take out loans by depositing cryptocurrency, avoiding the need to cash out.\n\nThere are risks of course. An investigation by Coindesk found instances of uncollateralized lending by the network, where a borrower default would leave either Celsius Networks or P2P lenders with irreversible losses. And there\u2019s always a temptation to make riskier loans that earn higher interest payments.\n\nA sudden drop in collateral values (i.e., cryptocurrencies) can also have a knock-on effect to Celsius\u2019 value. As of writing, Celsius requires a 2.7 ETH deposit to borrow $1,000. At today\u2019s crypto prices, a borrower should willingly repay the loan to retrieve their collateral. If ETH prices plummet however, the same person might instead decide to walk away with the money, leaving Celsius investors hoping that the Network hedged its bets.\n\nNevertheless, Celsius shows a great deal of promise. CEL is highly differentiated from Bitcoin, and investment risks will decline as cryptocurrency prices eventually stabilize.\n\n \n\nInvestors might have written off Neo long ago. The China-based cryptocurrency (formerly known as Antshares) went into a tailspin back in 2018 when the Chinese Central Government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. The currency remains almost 80% down from its all-time highs.\n\nYet change is on the horizon. In April last year, the Chinese authorities began a limited rollout of e-yuan, a government-backed cryptocurrency. People expect the CCP to expand the program during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nMuch of this change comes from a recognition that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. And rather than allow outside players like Bitcoin and Ethereum to push finance out of the CCP\u2019s sight, they have started embracing home-grown cryptocurrencies as alternatives.\n\nSmaller Chinese-based cryptocurrencies have already started emerging. VeChain, another promising cryptocurrency, helps Chinese companies with supply-chain management.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to know if the CCP will also anoint Neo a cryptocurrency champion, there\u2019s phenomenal upside to be had if they do.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin\u2019s Nosedive below $45,000 Can Open Way to Continued Correction, Ethereum\u2019s Repeats after...", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/_vAsLCzb6bVpoG_f0ZCrrg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/b76915b30c62f709fbe1d1291f267707", "auther": "Anissimov Konstantin", "body": "BTC/USD started the week at 57,499 near the all-time high at 58,400, based on the CEX.IOpricing. In the first four hours of Monday\u2019s trading session, BTC/USD declined to 56,000, which was an important support level in intraday terms. The level produced some buying pressure for the pair but only for the next four hours, as BTC/USD closed the 4-hour candlestick between 04:00 and 08:00 UTC at 46,479.\n\nThat, however, made no lasting influence, and BTC/USD had broken down below 56,000 and dropped below 53,500 by 16:00 UTC. That was a signal for a big sale, as the Bitcoin market had been overheated. In confirmation of that hypothesis, BTC/USD made a huge rollercoaster swing in the interval between 13:00 and 15:00 UTC, falling from 53,677 to 47,400 and bouncing back up. Meanwhile, Glassnode, an on-chain data aggregator reported that high-net-worth Bitcoin holders had sold 140,000 BTC, which was proof of traders\u2019 readiness to sell BTC/USD big time. There was a slight upside recovery to 56,000 at the end of Monday, but with the start of Tuesday\u2019s session the selling went on.\n\nBy 09:00 UTC of Tuesday, 23rd February, BTC/USD had already been at 46,500 as per Bitstamp\u2019s exchange rate. Form 09:00 UTC, BTC/USD continued sideways, with high volatility taking place in the price action. The pair was edging sideways within the corridor of 45,000 \u2013 49,000 until 01:00 UTC of Wednesday, 24th February. At that time a rebound above 49,000 started to take place and continued until 05:00 UTC, with 51,000 topped out.\n\nThe volatility reduced considerably, as the pair continued edging sideways within the price range of 50,000 \u2013 51,000. At 13:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, a drawdown to 49,000 happened; afterwards, BTC/USD continued between 48,000 \u2013 50,000 until the end of Wednesday. The sideways fluctuations continued on Thursday, 25th February, until 12:00 UTC. At 12:00 \u2013 14:00 UTC, BTC/USD bounced to 52,000. Afterwards, BTC/USD began another continued downfall, which continued to 45,000 on Friday, 26th February. The falling stopped at 08:00 UTC, as the zone offered a buying opportunity.\n\nBTC/USD had bounced to 48,265 by 17:00 UTC and then reversed downwards until 23:00 UTC, almost reaching 45,000, and closed Friday at 45,447. On Saturday, 27th February, BTC/USD the bulls continued supporting the trading pair with buying volumes, and BTC/USD briefly rose to 48,100 between 0200 \u2013 02:45 UTC. The pair continued sideways until 07:00 UTC, once breaking above the 50-period hourly SMA, but was eventually driven down below 47,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC. The upside attempts at the SMA continued unsuccessfully until the end of Saturday. On Sunday, 28th February, selling pressure increased and saw BTC/USD gradually head down to 43,067 at its lowest. The capitalisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was an indication of continuing selling bias in the trading pair.\n\nThere was some news in the week of 22nd February that kept up Bitcoin bulls\u2019 hopes of an upside recovery. Square, Inc. that had invested $50,000 million in Bitcoin in October 2020 made another Bitcoin purchase worth $170 million on 24th February 2021. Besides that, MicroStrategy \u2013 the corporate frontrunner among Bitcoin investors \u2013 bought 19,452 more BTC worth $1.026 billion at an average price of $52,765. This new purchase had brought MicroStrategy\u2019s exposure to Bitcoin to 90,531 BTC.\n\nThese tendencies clearly showed that high profile investors were happy with the Bitcoin drawdown and were ready to buy the dip. This shows that Bitcoin continues to be looked upon as a solid financial instrument, and every downside correction is going to be met with substantial buying volumes.\n\nThe decline to nearly 43,000 and a stabilisation below 44,000 on the 4-hour timeframe was a signal of continuing bearish bias in BTC/USD, promising lower lows. Still, some bullish momentum remains to be present, and a breakthrough above 48,000 and above the 50-period 4-hour SMA would signal a change of bias and an upside recovery gaining traction. On the contrary, another decline to 43,000 will mean a continuation of bearish price action, with prospects of getting back to testing the 31,000 support level.\n\nTherefore, we shall soon get answers on where BTC/USD will go next. With the pair edging higher towards 48,000 in the morning hours of Monday, the odds for a breakthrough are presently going higher.\n\nETH/USD opened the week of 22nd February at 1,933.4 and headed straight down from the start of the day, briefly getting below the 50-period 4-hour SMA with the lower wick of Monday\u2019s first 4-hour candlestick reaching 1,867.3. The SMA gave ETH/USD some transitory support, but it continued sinking lower until 09:00 UTC on Tuesday, 23rd February, with support being found at 1,440. The trading pair continued sideways until the end of Tuesday, fluctuating within a considerable range of 1,360 and 1,600.\n\nFrom the start of Wednesday, 24th February, the ETH/USD trading pair headed upwards to reach 1,715 and break above the 50-period hourly SMA. The volatility shrank considerably, as ETH/USD spent most of the time until 18:00 UTC on Thursday, 25th February within the range of 1,586.4 \u2013 1,662, being regularly supported by the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nETH/USD, ETH/USD headed down from 18:00 UTC on Thursday through to 08:00 UTC on Friday, 26th February. The pair eventually hit 1,402 at the minimum and continued edging sideways between 1,424.7 and 1,560 until the end of Saturday, 27th February, with the 50-period hourly SMA upkeeping the ETH/USD bearish momentum.\n\nAnother downswing took place on Sunday, 28th February, with a minimum at 1,299.6. However, an upside recovery that began at 19:00 UTC and continued through to the end of Sunday, with the 1,392.2 support level letting ETH/USD close the week at 1,417.5 as per the CEX.IO pricing. On top of that, ETH/USD finished Sunday in a hammer candlestick on the daily timeframe, which coupled with the 1,420 support level gives increased potential for a full-fledged upside recovery in the near term.\n\nIt became known that the intraday pullback in ETH/USD between Tuesday, 23rd February, and Wednesday, 24th February, from the mid-to-lower 1,400s to above 1,700 coincided with a purchase of 10,000 ETH by Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which brought its Ether exposure to 3.17 ETH.\n\nThe bullish market reaction to the purchase clearly shows that big players\u2019 moves have a strong impact on the Ethereum market. And the purchase itself shows that high-profile investors, who constitute most of Grayscale clients, have trust in Ethereum in the long term, which can result in continued market growth for the smart-contract pioneer.\n\nKonstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Continues to Show Strength \n-  S&P 500 Price Forecast \u2013 Stock Markets Recover on Monday \n-  Target Has Strong Upside Potential; Likely to Log Over 50% Jump in Q4 Profit \n-  GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues Noisy Behavior \n-  GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Gives up Early Gains \n-  Stocks Move Higher At The Start Of The Month \n"}, {"headline": "BTC/USD stagnates under 50,000, ETH/USD sinks under 1,500", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/1.CMBbcF7Ty_T6LdBMUGSg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3163aad28e8c2f2b8cadc514cd079893", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "BTC/USD made a bullish attack at 50,000 early on 2nd March, but it was swiftly curbed by the mark, with the pair finding itself under 48,000 at the end of the day. Buying pressure was still there, but more buying volumes might be required for a pullback above 50,000 to come through.\n\nBTC/USD opened 2nd March at 49,720 as per the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair edged above 50,000 in the first hour but found itself at 49,556 at the hour\u2019s close. An intraday retracement took the pair to 48,354 at 08:00 UTC. Having risen above 49,000 between 08:00 and 09:00 UTC, the pair continued sideways until 16:00, clinging to the 49,000 handle. By 16:00 UTC, a head-and-shoulders-looking pattern had formed and was confirmed with a bearish candlestick between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC that landed on 47,500 and the 50-period hourly SMA.\n\nThe moving average did support the price, signaling some lack of confidence of the bears and the presence of buying appetite. The pair continued trending mildly upwards, consistently leaning on the 50-period hourly moving average until 19:00 UTC, but slipped below it at 20:00 UTC.\n\nThe failure of the breakthrough above 50,000, should extend the expectations of an exit out the horizontal channel between 43,000 and 50,000. The update on corporate and institutional holdings from Bitcointreasuries.com on the day showed that the cumulative figure had reached 1.36 million BTC worth around $65 billion at the time. This is an apparent sign of continuing demand for Bitcoin from high-profile investors. Considering their traditional long-term investment fashion, their demand might play a key role in Bitcoin\u2019s financial maturity.\n\nETH/USD spent most of the trading session of 2nd March between 1,540 and 1,580. Selling pressure increased at 16:00 UTC, and the trading pair slipped to under 1,500 in the day\u2019s later hours.\u00a0\n\nETH/USD started 2nd March at 1,572 and produced a sharp spike to 1,600. But the buying volumes were too small, and the pair quickly got back to 1,570, continuing sideways between 1,540 and 1,580 for the most part until 16:00 UTC. Between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, ETH/USD broke down below 1,540 and closed the hour at 1,503.5 based on the CEX.IO exchange rate. The pair was consistently heading down afterwards and slipped to 1,460 \u2013 1,480 in the period between 20:00 \u2013 23:00 UTC.\n\nMeanwhile, The Block shows that Ethereum miners set a new record for monthly earnings in February 2021, having earned $1.37 billion during the 28-day-long month. Of those, $772.78 million were transaction fees and $644.4 million were block rewards, which is the first precedent of transaction fees dominating block rewards in Ethereum miners\u2019 revenues on a monthly basis in all of Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nThis shows how much demand is going on for Ethereum as a means of transfer of value, the DeFi market probably being the biggest driver of that demand, as its market capitalisation grew to 71.87 billion, according to CoinGecko, as of 2nd March. Also, the anticipation of the transition of Ethereum to the PoS Beacon Chain is heating up demand for Ether as a means of passive income: according to The Block, the ETH 2.0 deposit contract had 3.33 million ETH on 2nd March.\n\nETH/USD might have found a resting point between 1,460 \u2013 1,570 and may continue sideways on shrinking volatility for a while before taking a turn outside this corridor. The 1,392 daily support level can be a source of resurging buying pressure for ETH/USD in the scenario of a gradual decline.\n"}, {"headline": "Kings of Leon NFT Album: 17 Things to Know as the Rock Album Goes Digital", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/bsE5E5QZ6y_tR2wjagS_8g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/9d4966ecff929dbfd34f5681bdb729ff", "auther": "Vivian Medithi ", "body": "American rock band Kings of Leon have announced their next album will be released as a non-fungible token (NFT) this Friday, just the latest high-profile digital collectible coming to market at a time of skyrocketing interest in cryptoassets.\n\n \n\nHere\u2019s what investors should know about the new album, \u201cNFT Yourself,\u201d coming out Friday, March 5:\n\nOn the date of publication, Vivian Medithi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH uptrend to $2,000 in grave danger amid flashing sell signals", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/REIeQHMAYcmTIXjf3ot2qQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bfcbe8c59e51f681a528c61f971e9894", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Ethereum's technical breakout on Monday had a target close to $1,700, but the price recovery failed to overcome the barrier at $1,600. A correction is underway with Ether struggling to hold above $1,500.\n\nEthereum gas fees is exorbitantly high, but the situation has become a norm. Over the last 30 to 60 days, the fee used to make transactions on the network increased significantly. While the gas averages at $12, there are instances where it swells three to four times.\n\nHowever, Santiment's data reveals that a spike in the gas fees usually lasts an average of 30 to 60 minutes. What is intriguing is that the upswings in the gas tend to coincide with Ether's local price bottoms and short-term bounce backs.\n\n\n\nEthereum average fees (21 days)\n\nNote that this finding is not conclusive but gives an insight into the gas fee spikes, which could be triggered by panic selloffs in conjunction with 'paper hand' capitulation. A buy the dip pressure then results in Ethereum's short-term bottom and a pullback.\n\nEther is trading at $1,545 and flirting with the 50 Simple Moving Average (SMA). The breakout from the falling wedge pattern suggested that the liftoff will hit levels close to $1,700. Moreover, a step above the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) could trigger more buy orders as investors anticipate a return to highs above $2,000.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nMeanwhile, failing to hold above the 50 SMA on the 4-hour chart would be a bearish signal. Panic-selling will increase the overhead pressure, forcing Ethereum to explore downhill levels toward $1,200.\n\nNotably, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal in the form of a green nine candlestick. The bearish signal comes at a time when the uptrend is in jeopardy. If validated, the pioneer altcoin will fall in one to four 4-hour candlesticks, adding credibility to the bearish narrative.\n\n\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe uptrend will be secured if Ethereum manages to hold onto the 50 SMA support on the 4-hour chart. Besides, the falling wedge pattern's impact is still in the picture, and with a small boost, ETH could swing to highs above $1,700. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has a bullish impulse, which could keep buyer interest high.\n"}, {"headline": "Stellar Lumens Is Impressive as a Technology But Not Currently as a Trade", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jDGEk7m07GGEvjcDeE4_KQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/c29b5e8f640f2124ee5501dc12ec92d4", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "As a fundamental fintech innovation, it\u2019s hard not get excited about Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) and its underlying blockchain technology. While we have increasingly become a digitalization-of-everything economy, our payment processing solutions remain curiously archaic. Stellar offers a viable alternative but does that necessarily bode well for its XLM cryptocurrency token?\n\n \n\nI\u2019m going to dive into the nuances of this question. But first, I believe the integration of the Stellar Lumens blockchain technology into mainstream financial institutions should be encouraged. And at some point, you\u2019d figure that this staid industry will be forced to accept that we live in the 21st century.\n\nRecently, I had the displeasure of having to make a wire transfer to another U.S.-based bank. The cost to me was $25 to make the transfer. Additionally, the time it took for the wire transfer to process, along with associated filings was about one week \u2013 that\u2019s an eternity in our supposedly advanced society.\n\nOn the flipside, cryptocurrency transactions occur much quicker and cheaper. Earlier this year, I made several Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) transactions, with the process taking a few hours to complete and with transaction fees in the single-digit dollar range.\n\nHowever, crypto proponents consider Bitcoin as the transactional laggard in this space. Other cryptocurrency transactions, such as through the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) or Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) blockchains occur at lightning-fast speeds and with more modest fees.\n\nAnd this is where Stellar Lumens truly shines. The platform is one of the fastest. Better yet, because of its low flat fees, Stellar opens the door to a viable micropayments economy. In turn, this will help bring the developing part of the world into the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nPlus, we don\u2019t even have to think so globally. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 5.4% or roughly 7.1 million households were unbanked in 2019. Due to the pandemic and the resultant economic crisis, this figure will surely increase.\n\nBefore I go any further into the investment proposition of Stellar Lumens, I need to make a comprehensive disclosure. Yes, I own XLM tokens, but the amount that I have now is a pittance compared to my prior holdings.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m necessarily bearish on XLM. However, when the cryptocurrency market started going sour a little over a week ago, I began taking evasive action. I converted some of my XLM holdings into BTC and some into cold hard cash.\n\nAs I watch the Stellar Lumens token tumble downward \u2013 albeit with a few head fakes here and there \u2013 I\u2019m regretting that I didn\u2019t go all into cash. Oh well. If I\u2019ve learned anything about cryptocurrencies over the years, you just never know where they might end up.\n\nExcept that I did know \u2013 at least, in my own mind. Aside from my own second guessing, the XLM price action looked weak following its trend collapse on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23. Subsequent trades have attempted to push the price back up toward 50 cents, but to no avail.\n\nCan the Stellar Lumens token recover that support level and make its way toward all-time highs? Perhaps, but that will likely depend on Bitcoin. Unfortunately, from where I stand Bitcoin looks like a basket case. Gone is the moxie that took the original virtual currency to the edge of $60,000. Instead, BTC stakeholders should consider themselves fortunate if it doesn\u2019t fall below $40,000.\n\nBelow $40K? Yeah, it can happen (though of course I\u2019m not guaranteeing it) precisely for the same reason why the cryptocurrencies started skyrocketing earlier this year: big institutions are embracing this digital revolution. They\u2019re wonderful to have when they\u2019re driving up the asset. But if these alpha dogs decide to sell, the volatility could be unprecedented.\n\nAs Bitcoin reaches down and cuts into institutional profits, you can rest assured that they\u2019ll dump like mad to preserve their wealth.\n\nThen, you also must factor in human concerns such as tax season and rising bond yields. For the former, Tax Day is approaching, which means profit taking may be in order to help ease the burden imposed by Uncle Sam.\n\nBut the latter case is the most intriguing one for me. The sudden rise in yields not only demonstrates that the incentive to hold risk-on assets is diminishing, it highlights that cryptocurrencies represent the riskiest asset class of them all. It doesn\u2019t pay dividends and it has severe third-party risk in terms of government intervention and/or cyberattacks.\n\nIf the Russians can compromise our most secure assets, then a disruptive attack on the crypto ecosystem seems like child\u2019s play.\n\nFor me, there seems to be too many questions to be comfortable wagering on Stellar Lumens right now. Personally, I\u2019d wait until Bitcoin stabilizes. If not, a low-30-cent/high-20-cent price range wouldn\u2019t be too surprising given the context.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in XLM, BTC, ETH, LTC.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.
