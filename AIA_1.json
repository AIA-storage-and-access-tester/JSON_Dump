"auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin. Look for Ethereum to continue to outperform Bitcoin over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum (ETH/USD) Falls 26% From Historic High; What's Next?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "NewsBTC", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/uODCo_yIa2bSLAfW7hCVJQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3b47359ce0612a5c63c201d5d072d26f", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000, Setting A New All-Time High | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Crypto BriefingCryptocurrency", "body": "Ethereum's ascent continues.

ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "22 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Cardano Is Set to Outpace Even the Fastest-Moving Crypto Coins", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/yEZp_IaxKRLdyg4m3KlMeA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/317be543086d8124932f3833a6ca90ad", "auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: This article was updated on Feb. 25. 2021, to correct a recent high price.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t very long ago that the Cardano\u00a0(CCC:ADA-USD) bulls struggled to maintain a dime, not to mention a dollar per coin. Today, the picture is drastically different as Cardano is quickly becoming a crypto-market darling.\n\nCould Italian physician and mathematician Girolamo Cardano possibly have known that a currency \u2013 and along with it, a grassroots movement \u2013 would bear his name someday?\n\nOf course not, but it\u2019s fun to consider the connection between the revolutionary ideas of the past and the present.\n\nAnd today, Cardano\u2019s potential as a next-generation disruptor of predecessors like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) is top-of-mind for modern-world traders. So, let\u2019s begin with an analysis of ADA\u2019s wild price action.\n\nAmong commodities traders, silver is sometimes called \u201cthe devil\u2019s metal\u201d due to its high level of volatility. Could Cardano, then, be \u201cthe devil\u2019s cryptocurrency\u201d?\n\nCardano demonstrated its moonshot potential back in late 2017 and early 2018, when it rocketed up from 2 cents to $1. Unfortunately, before the end of 2018, ADA plunged to around 3 cents.\n\nThroughout most of the next couple of years, the bulls couldn\u2019t seem to keep Cardano above 10 cents. And within the past year, Cardano slipped to a low point of approximately 2 cents.\n\nLoyal coin holders were rewarded eventually, though, as Cardano commenced a breathtaking run-up in late 2020. By the end of the year, the bulls managed to push the ADA price up to 18 cents.\n\nYet, that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. If you can believe it, the bulls bid the Cardano price back up to a 52-week high of almost $1.20. Now $2 is now a realistic price target for Cardano.\n\nCardano remains quite unique among popular cryptocurrencies. Sure, it\u2019s cheaper on a per-coin basis than Bitcoin and Ethereum, but that not the only difference.\n\nBesides being decentralized (which could be said about many cryptocurrencies), the Cardano network is known as a multi-asset smart contract platform.\n\nBy \u201cmulti-asset,\u201d I mean that multiple types of cryptocurrencies can be traded on the Cardano blockchain network. Plus, the Cardano network\u2019s use of smart contracts \u201cmeans that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum,\u201d to quote\u00a0InvestorPlace contributor\u00a0Thomas Yeung.\n\nAnd now, with the recent Goguen update, users will be able to create user-defined tokens. These will be \u201cnative\u201d custom tokens, meaning that they can be transacted directly on the blockchain.\n\nOnly time will tell, but the rollout of potentially limitless varieties of native tokens should, I believe, enhance the value of the network.\n\nI\u2019m generally not one to recommend buying an asset because a celebrity likes it.\n\nStill, I just couldn\u2019t resist relaying a news item involving Gene Simmons, the rock-star bass player of the band Kiss.\n\nReportedly, Simmons has purchased $300,000 worth of Cardano. Simmons also evidently has holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies.\n\nAt around the time the report of Simmons\u2019 big ADA purchase was released, Cardano was the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at nearly $29 billion.\n\nI\u2019m not expecting many people to buy ADA just because Simmons owns it. Rather, I believe that ADA has (pardon the pun) rock-star potential as an affordable and adaptable digital asset and network.\n\nSome folks have even proposed that Cardano could be an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t advise pitting crypto against crypto, however.\n\nThere\u2019s more than enough room for multiple successful digital currencies, and ADA is sufficiently unique to carve out its own niche.\n\nRock-star endorsements aside, Cardano is known to be a fast mover. And lately, the bulls have been in full control of ADA\u2019s price action.\n\nTherefore, even after achieving all-time-high price points, there\u2019s still room for much more upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Is in the Shadow of Bitcoin But That May Not Last", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "Thanks to widescale institutional investment into Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), the original cryptocurrency eventually made its way above $52,000, truly a milestone moment for the blockchain economy. Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general. But you should at least know this reality before stepping forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The bears dragged the price below the channel, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows buying at lower levels.\n\nThe buyers are currently attempting to keep the BTC/USD pair inside the channel. However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. \n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise. \n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.\n\nEven as Binance Coin\u2019s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to turn up from 71. \n\nThe score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB\u2019s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS\u2122score, BNB price started to rally from $201. \n\nThat was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price. After a brief dip, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to strengthen from 71 and reached 80 as the price recovered to $271 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. \n\nIf the price again turns down from the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.\n\nConversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969. \n\nThe long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT). \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS\u2122 score reached 82 when DOT\u2019s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS\u2122 score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24. \n\nDOT\u2019s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.\n\nA breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.\n\nThe bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.\n\nXRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.\n\nBuying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.\n\nThe next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.\n\nThe failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions. \n\nThe LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.\n\nIf the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.\n\nChainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.\n\nThe dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears. \n\nThe sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.\n\nIf the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23. \n\nThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

"auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin. Look for Ethereum to continue to outperform Bitcoin over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully.

ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "22 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Cardano Is Set to Outpace Even the Fastest-Moving Crypto Coins", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/yEZp_IaxKRLdyg4m3KlMeA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/317be543086d8124932f3833a6ca90ad", "auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: This article was updated on Feb. 25. 2021, to correct a recent high price.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t very long ago that the Cardano\u00a0(CCC:ADA-USD) bulls struggled to maintain a dime, not to mention a dollar per coin. Today, the picture is drastically different as Cardano is quickly becoming a crypto-market darling.\n\nCould Italian physician and mathematician Girolamo Cardano possibly have known that a currency \u2013 and along with it, a grassroots movement \u2013 would bear his name someday?\n\nOf course not, but it\u2019s fun to consider the connection between the revolutionary ideas of the past and the present.\n\nAnd today, Cardano\u2019s potential as a next-generation disruptor of predecessors like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) is top-of-mind for modern-world traders. So, let\u2019s begin with an analysis of ADA\u2019s wild price action.\n\nAmong commodities traders, silver is sometimes called \u201cthe devil\u2019s metal\u201d due to its high level of volatility. Could Cardano, then, be \u201cthe devil\u2019s cryptocurrency\u201d?\n\nCardano demonstrated its moonshot potential back in late 2017 and early 2018, when it rocketed up from 2 cents to $1. Unfortunately, before the end of 2018, ADA plunged to around 3 cents.\n\nThroughout most of the next couple of years, the bulls couldn\u2019t seem to keep Cardano above 10 cents. And within the past year, Cardano slipped to a low point of approximately 2 cents.\n\nLoyal coin holders were rewarded eventually, though, as Cardano commenced a breathtaking run-up in late 2020. By the end of the year, the bulls managed to push the ADA price up to 18 cents.\n\nYet, that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. If you can believe it, the bulls bid the Cardano price back up to a 52-week high of almost $1.20. Now $2 is now a realistic price target for Cardano.\n\nCardano remains quite unique among popular cryptocurrencies. Sure, it\u2019s cheaper on a per-coin basis than Bitcoin and Ethereum, but that not the only difference.\n\nBesides being decentralized (which could be said about many cryptocurrencies), the Cardano network is known as a multi-asset smart contract platform.\n\nBy \u201cmulti-asset,\u201d I mean that multiple types of cryptocurrencies can be traded on the Cardano blockchain network. Plus, the Cardano network\u2019s use of smart contracts \u201cmeans that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum,\u201d to quote\u00a0InvestorPlace contributor\u00a0Thomas Yeung.\n\nAnd now, with the recent Goguen update, users will be able to create user-defined tokens. These will be \u201cnative\u201d custom tokens, meaning that they can be transacted directly on the blockchain.\n\nOnly time will tell, but the rollout of potentially limitless varieties of native tokens should, I believe, enhance the value of the network.\n\nI\u2019m generally not one to recommend buying an asset because a celebrity likes it.\n\nStill, I just couldn\u2019t resist relaying a news item involving Gene Simmons, the rock-star bass player of the band Kiss.\n\nReportedly, Simmons has purchased $300,000 worth of Cardano. Simmons also evidently has holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies.\n\nAt around the time the report of Simmons\u2019 big ADA purchase was released, Cardano was the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at nearly $29 billion.\n\nI\u2019m not expecting many people to buy ADA just because Simmons owns it. Rather, I believe that ADA has (pardon the pun) rock-star potential as an affordable and adaptable digital asset and network.\n\nSome folks have even proposed that Cardano could be an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t advise pitting crypto against crypto, however.\n\nThere\u2019s more than enough room for multiple successful digital currencies, and ADA is sufficiently unique to carve out its own niche.\n\nRock-star endorsements aside, Cardano is known to be a fast mover. And lately, the bulls have been in full control of ADA\u2019s price action.\n\nTherefore, even after achieving all-time-high price points, there\u2019s still room for much more upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Is in the Shadow of Bitcoin But That May Not Last", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "Thanks to widescale institutional investment into Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), the original cryptocurrency eventually made its way above $52,000, truly a milestone moment for the blockchain economy. Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general. But you should at least know this reality before stepping forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This takes the company\u2019s total holding to 90,531 Bitcoin.\n\nAnother company that bought Bitcoin during the current market correction is Square.

Glassnode data suggests that Bitcoin whales, holding between 1,000 Bitcoin to 10,000 Bitcoin and \u201chumpback whales\u201d holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin have sold more than 140,000 Bitcoin in February. \n\nIn the past, the whales swayed the crypto markets at their will.

However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. \n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise. \n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.\n\nEven as Binance Coin\u2019s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to turn up from 71. \n\nThe score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB\u2019s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS\u2122score, BNB price started to rally from $201. \n\nThat was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price. After a brief dip, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to strengthen from 71 and reached 80 as the price recovered to $271 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. \n\nIf the price again turns down from the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.\n\nConversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969. \n\nThe long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT). \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS\u2122 score reached 82 when DOT\u2019s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS\u2122 score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24. \n\nDOT\u2019s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.\n\nA breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.\n\nThe bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.\n\nXRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.\n\nBuying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.\n\nThe next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.\n\nThe failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions. \n\nThe LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.\n\nIf the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.\n\nChainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.\n\nThe dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears. \n\nThe sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.\n\nIf the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23. \n\nThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

"auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin. Look for Ethereum to continue to outperform Bitcoin over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum (ETH/USD) Falls 26% From Historic High; What's Next?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "NewsBTC", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/uODCo_yIa2bSLAfW7hCVJQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3b47359ce0612a5c63c201d5d072d26f", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000, Setting A New All-Time High | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Crypto BriefingCryptocurrency", "body": "Ethereum's ascent continues.

ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "22 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Cardano Is Set to Outpace Even the Fastest-Moving Crypto Coins", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/yEZp_IaxKRLdyg4m3KlMeA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/317be543086d8124932f3833a6ca90ad", "auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: This article was updated on Feb. 25. 2021, to correct a recent high price.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t very long ago that the Cardano\u00a0(CCC:ADA-USD) bulls struggled to maintain a dime, not to mention a dollar per coin. Today, the picture is drastically different as Cardano is quickly becoming a crypto-market darling.\n\nCould Italian physician and mathematician Girolamo Cardano possibly have known that a currency \u2013 and along with it, a grassroots movement \u2013 would bear his name someday?\n\nOf course not, but it\u2019s fun to consider the connection between the revolutionary ideas of the past and the present.\n\nAnd today, Cardano\u2019s potential as a next-generation disruptor of predecessors like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) is top-of-mind for modern-world traders. So, let\u2019s begin with an analysis of ADA\u2019s wild price action.\n\nAmong commodities traders, silver is sometimes called \u201cthe devil\u2019s metal\u201d due to its high level of volatility. Could Cardano, then, be \u201cthe devil\u2019s cryptocurrency\u201d?\n\nCardano demonstrated its moonshot potential back in late 2017 and early 2018, when it rocketed up from 2 cents to $1. Unfortunately, before the end of 2018, ADA plunged to around 3 cents.\n\nThroughout most of the next couple of years, the bulls couldn\u2019t seem to keep Cardano above 10 cents. And within the past year, Cardano slipped to a low point of approximately 2 cents.\n\nLoyal coin holders were rewarded eventually, though, as Cardano commenced a breathtaking run-up in late 2020. By the end of the year, the bulls managed to push the ADA price up to 18 cents.\n\nYet, that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. If you can believe it, the bulls bid the Cardano price back up to a 52-week high of almost $1.20. Now $2 is now a realistic price target for Cardano.\n\nCardano remains quite unique among popular cryptocurrencies. Sure, it\u2019s cheaper on a per-coin basis than Bitcoin and Ethereum, but that not the only difference.\n\nBesides being decentralized (which could be said about many cryptocurrencies), the Cardano network is known as a multi-asset smart contract platform.\n\nBy \u201cmulti-asset,\u201d I mean that multiple types of cryptocurrencies can be traded on the Cardano blockchain network. Plus, the Cardano network\u2019s use of smart contracts \u201cmeans that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum,\u201d to quote\u00a0InvestorPlace contributor\u00a0Thomas Yeung.\n\nAnd now, with the recent Goguen update, users will be able to create user-defined tokens. These will be \u201cnative\u201d custom tokens, meaning that they can be transacted directly on the blockchain.\n\nOnly time will tell, but the rollout of potentially limitless varieties of native tokens should, I believe, enhance the value of the network.\n\nI\u2019m generally not one to recommend buying an asset because a celebrity likes it.\n\nStill, I just couldn\u2019t resist relaying a news item involving Gene Simmons, the rock-star bass player of the band Kiss.\n\nReportedly, Simmons has purchased $300,000 worth of Cardano. Simmons also evidently has holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies.\n\nAt around the time the report of Simmons\u2019 big ADA purchase was released, Cardano was the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at nearly $29 billion.\n\nI\u2019m not expecting many people to buy ADA just because Simmons owns it. Rather, I believe that ADA has (pardon the pun) rock-star potential as an affordable and adaptable digital asset and network.\n\nSome folks have even proposed that Cardano could be an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t advise pitting crypto against crypto, however.\n\nThere\u2019s more than enough room for multiple successful digital currencies, and ADA is sufficiently unique to carve out its own niche.\n\nRock-star endorsements aside, Cardano is known to be a fast mover. And lately, the bulls have been in full control of ADA\u2019s price action.\n\nTherefore, even after achieving all-time-high price points, there\u2019s still room for much more upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Is in the Shadow of Bitcoin But That May Not Last", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "Thanks to widescale institutional investment into Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), the original cryptocurrency eventually made its way above $52,000, truly a milestone moment for the blockchain economy.

Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin.

This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general. But you should at least know this reality before stepping forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies. Over the past several years, he has delivered unique, critical insights for the investment markets, as well as various other industries including legal, construction management, and healthcare.\n"}, {"headline": "Price analysis 2/24: BTC, ETH, BNB, DOT, ADA, XRP, LTC, LINK, BCH, XLM", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Cointelegraph", "date": "20 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/qpqsZzc38vlWOCgsWhlp5g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/6c1beef72c65a65158e1f4fe019706f5", "auther": "Rakesh Upadhyay ", "body": "Institutional investors continue to pour money into the crypto sector even with the current dip below $45,000. On Feb.24, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced that it had recently purchased over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) at an average rate of $52,765 per coin. This takes the company\u2019s total holding to 90,531 Bitcoin.\n\nAnother company that bought Bitcoin during the current market correction is Square. The company said it had acquired roughly \u201c3,318 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million.\u201d\n\nThese purchases by institutional investors show they are bullish on the long-term prospects of Bitcoin and believe that it is a good buy near $50,000. \n\nWhile the institutional purchases are a bullish sign, traders must also remember that for every buyer, there is a seller. Glassnode data suggests that Bitcoin whales, holding between 1,000 Bitcoin to 10,000 Bitcoin and \u201chumpback whales\u201d holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin have sold more than 140,000 Bitcoin in February. \n\nIn the past, the whales swayed the crypto markets at their will. But the entry of institutional investors has reduced their dominance. Therefore, along with the whales, traders must also keep an eye on the institutional activity.\n\nWhile large investors can buy and hold for the long-term, the smaller investor would do well to buy at the right time to make the most of the limited available capital. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s pullback from the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,323) on Feb. 22 was greeted with aggressive selling on February 23. The bears dragged the price below the channel, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows buying at lower levels.\n\nThe buyers are currently attempting to keep the BTC/USD pair inside the channel. However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. \n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise. \n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.\n\nEven as Binance Coin\u2019s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to turn up from 71. \n\nThe score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB\u2019s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS\u2122score, BNB price started to rally from $201. \n\nThat was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price. After a brief dip, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to strengthen from 71 and reached 80 as the price recovered to $271 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. \n\nIf the price again turns down from the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.\n\nConversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969. \n\nThe long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT). \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS\u2122 score reached 82 when DOT\u2019s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS\u2122 score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24. \n\nDOT\u2019s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.\n\nA breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.\n\nThe bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.\n\nXRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.\n\nBuying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.\n\nThe next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.\n\nThe failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions. \n\nThe LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.\n\nIf the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.\n\nChainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.\n\nThe dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears. \n\nThe sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.\n\nIf the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23. \n\nThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

"auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin. Look for Ethereum to continue to outperform Bitcoin over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum (ETH/USD) Falls 26% From Historic High; What's Next?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "NewsBTC", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/uODCo_yIa2bSLAfW7hCVJQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3b47359ce0612a5c63c201d5d072d26f", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000, Setting A New All-Time High | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Crypto BriefingCryptocurrency", "body": "Ethereum's ascent continues.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "22 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Cardano Is Set to Outpace Even the Fastest-Moving Crypto Coins", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/yEZp_IaxKRLdyg4m3KlMeA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/317be543086d8124932f3833a6ca90ad", "auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: This article was updated on Feb. 25. 2021, to correct a recent high price.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t very long ago that the Cardano\u00a0(CCC:ADA-USD) bulls struggled to maintain a dime, not to mention a dollar per coin. Today, the picture is drastically different as Cardano is quickly becoming a crypto-market darling.\n\nCould Italian physician and mathematician Girolamo Cardano possibly have known that a currency \u2013 and along with it, a grassroots movement \u2013 would bear his name someday?\n\nOf course not, but it\u2019s fun to consider the connection between the revolutionary ideas of the past and the present.\n\nAnd today, Cardano\u2019s potential as a next-generation disruptor of predecessors like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) is top-of-mind for modern-world traders. So, let\u2019s begin with an analysis of ADA\u2019s wild price action.\n\nAmong commodities traders, silver is sometimes called \u201cthe devil\u2019s metal\u201d due to its high level of volatility. Could Cardano, then, be \u201cthe devil\u2019s cryptocurrency\u201d?\n\nCardano demonstrated its moonshot potential back in late 2017 and early 2018, when it rocketed up from 2 cents to $1. Unfortunately, before the end of 2018, ADA plunged to around 3 cents.\n\nThroughout most of the next couple of years, the bulls couldn\u2019t seem to keep Cardano above 10 cents. And within the past year, Cardano slipped to a low point of approximately 2 cents.\n\nLoyal coin holders were rewarded eventually, though, as Cardano commenced a breathtaking run-up in late 2020. By the end of the year, the bulls managed to push the ADA price up to 18 cents.\n\nYet, that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. If you can believe it, the bulls bid the Cardano price back up to a 52-week high of almost $1.20. Now $2 is now a realistic price target for Cardano.\n\nCardano remains quite unique among popular cryptocurrencies. Sure, it\u2019s cheaper on a per-coin basis than Bitcoin and Ethereum, but that not the only difference.\n\nBesides being decentralized (which could be said about many cryptocurrencies), the Cardano network is known as a multi-asset smart contract platform.\n\nBy \u201cmulti-asset,\u201d I mean that multiple types of cryptocurrencies can be traded on the Cardano blockchain network. Plus, the Cardano network\u2019s use of smart contracts \u201cmeans that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum,\u201d to quote\u00a0InvestorPlace contributor\u00a0Thomas Yeung.\n\nAnd now, with the recent Goguen update, users will be able to create user-defined tokens. These will be \u201cnative\u201d custom tokens, meaning that they can be transacted directly on the blockchain.\n\nOnly time will tell, but the rollout of potentially limitless varieties of native tokens should, I believe, enhance the value of the network.\n\nI\u2019m generally not one to recommend buying an asset because a celebrity likes it.\n\nStill, I just couldn\u2019t resist relaying a news item involving Gene Simmons, the rock-star bass player of the band Kiss.\n\nReportedly, Simmons has purchased $300,000 worth of Cardano. Simmons also evidently has holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies.\n\nAt around the time the report of Simmons\u2019 big ADA purchase was released, Cardano was the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at nearly $29 billion.\n\nI\u2019m not expecting many people to buy ADA just because Simmons owns it. Rather, I believe that ADA has (pardon the pun) rock-star potential as an affordable and adaptable digital asset and network.\n\nSome folks have even proposed that Cardano could be an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t advise pitting crypto against crypto, however.\n\nThere\u2019s more than enough room for multiple successful digital currencies, and ADA is sufficiently unique to carve out its own niche.\n\nRock-star endorsements aside, Cardano is known to be a fast mover. And lately, the bulls have been in full control of ADA\u2019s price action.\n\nTherefore, even after achieving all-time-high price points, there\u2019s still room for much more upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Is in the Shadow of Bitcoin But That May Not Last", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "Thanks to widescale institutional investment into Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), the original cryptocurrency eventually made its way above $52,000, truly a milestone moment for the blockchain economy. Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general. But you should at least know this reality before stepping forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

On Feb.24, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced that it had recently purchased over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) at an average rate of $52,765 per coin. This takes the company\u2019s total holding to 90,531 Bitcoin.\n\nAnother company that bought Bitcoin during the current market correction is Square. The company said it had acquired roughly \u201c3,318 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million.\u201d\n\nThese purchases by institutional investors show they are bullish on the long-term prospects of Bitcoin and believe that it is a good buy near $50,000. \n\nWhile the institutional purchases are a bullish sign, traders must also remember that for every buyer, there is a seller. Glassnode data suggests that Bitcoin whales, holding between 1,000 Bitcoin to 10,000 Bitcoin and \u201chumpback whales\u201d holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin have sold more than 140,000 Bitcoin in February. \n\nIn the past, the whales swayed the crypto markets at their will. But the entry of institutional investors has reduced their dominance. Therefore, along with the whales, traders must also keep an eye on the institutional activity.\n\nWhile large investors can buy and hold for the long-term, the smaller investor would do well to buy at the right time to make the most of the limited available capital. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s pullback from the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,323) on Feb. 22 was greeted with aggressive selling on February 23. The bears dragged the price below the channel, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows buying at lower levels.\n\nThe buyers are currently attempting to keep the BTC/USD pair inside the channel. However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. \n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise. \n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.\n\nEven as Binance Coin\u2019s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to turn up from 71. \n\nThe score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB\u2019s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS\u2122score, BNB price started to rally from $201. \n\nThat was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price. After a brief dip, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to strengthen from 71 and reached 80 as the price recovered to $271 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. \n\nIf the price again turns down from the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.\n\nConversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969. \n\nThe long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT). \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS\u2122 score reached 82 when DOT\u2019s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS\u2122 score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24. \n\nDOT\u2019s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.\n\nA breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.\n\nThe bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.\n\nXRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.\n\nBuying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.\n\nThe next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.\n\nThe failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions. \n\nThe LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.\n\nIf the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.\n\nChainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.\n\nThe dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears. \n\nThe sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.\n\nIf the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23. \n\nThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

"auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin. Look for Ethereum to continue to outperform Bitcoin over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum (ETH/USD) Falls 26% From Historic High; What's Next?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "NewsBTC", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/uODCo_yIa2bSLAfW7hCVJQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3b47359ce0612a5c63c201d5d072d26f", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000, Setting A New All-Time High | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Crypto BriefingCryptocurrency", "body": "Ethereum's ascent continues.

ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "22 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Cardano Is Set to Outpace Even the Fastest-Moving Crypto Coins", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/yEZp_IaxKRLdyg4m3KlMeA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/317be543086d8124932f3833a6ca90ad", "auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: This article was updated on Feb. 25. 2021, to correct a recent high price.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t very long ago that the Cardano\u00a0(CCC:ADA-USD) bulls struggled to maintain a dime, not to mention a dollar per coin. Today, the picture is drastically different as Cardano is quickly becoming a crypto-market darling.\n\nCould Italian physician and mathematician Girolamo Cardano possibly have known that a currency \u2013 and along with it, a grassroots movement \u2013 would bear his name someday?\n\nOf course not, but it\u2019s fun to consider the connection between the revolutionary ideas of the past and the present.\n\nAnd today, Cardano\u2019s potential as a next-generation disruptor of predecessors like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) is top-of-mind for modern-world traders. So, let\u2019s begin with an analysis of ADA\u2019s wild price action.\n\nAmong commodities traders, silver is sometimes called \u201cthe devil\u2019s metal\u201d due to its high level of volatility. Could Cardano, then, be \u201cthe devil\u2019s cryptocurrency\u201d?\n\nCardano demonstrated its moonshot potential back in late 2017 and early 2018, when it rocketed up from 2 cents to $1. Unfortunately, before the end of 2018, ADA plunged to around 3 cents.\n\nThroughout most of the next couple of years, the bulls couldn\u2019t seem to keep Cardano above 10 cents. And within the past year, Cardano slipped to a low point of approximately 2 cents.\n\nLoyal coin holders were rewarded eventually, though, as Cardano commenced a breathtaking run-up in late 2020. By the end of the year, the bulls managed to push the ADA price up to 18 cents.\n\nYet, that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. If you can believe it, the bulls bid the Cardano price back up to a 52-week high of almost $1.20. Now $2 is now a realistic price target for Cardano.\n\nCardano remains quite unique among popular cryptocurrencies. Sure, it\u2019s cheaper on a per-coin basis than Bitcoin and Ethereum, but that not the only difference.\n\nBesides being decentralized (which could be said about many cryptocurrencies), the Cardano network is known as a multi-asset smart contract platform.\n\nBy \u201cmulti-asset,\u201d I mean that multiple types of cryptocurrencies can be traded on the Cardano blockchain network. Plus, the Cardano network\u2019s use of smart contracts \u201cmeans that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum,\u201d to quote\u00a0InvestorPlace contributor\u00a0Thomas Yeung.\n\nAnd now, with the recent Goguen update, users will be able to create user-defined tokens. These will be \u201cnative\u201d custom tokens, meaning that they can be transacted directly on the blockchain.\n\nOnly time will tell, but the rollout of potentially limitless varieties of native tokens should, I believe, enhance the value of the network.\n\nI\u2019m generally not one to recommend buying an asset because a celebrity likes it.\n\nStill, I just couldn\u2019t resist relaying a news item involving Gene Simmons, the rock-star bass player of the band Kiss.\n\nReportedly, Simmons has purchased $300,000 worth of Cardano. Simmons also evidently has holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies.\n\nAt around the time the report of Simmons\u2019 big ADA purchase was released, Cardano was the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at nearly $29 billion.\n\nI\u2019m not expecting many people to buy ADA just because Simmons owns it. Rather, I believe that ADA has (pardon the pun) rock-star potential as an affordable and adaptable digital asset and network.\n\nSome folks have even proposed that Cardano could be an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t advise pitting crypto against crypto, however.\n\nThere\u2019s more than enough room for multiple successful digital currencies, and ADA is sufficiently unique to carve out its own niche.\n\nRock-star endorsements aside, Cardano is known to be a fast mover. And lately, the bulls have been in full control of ADA\u2019s price action.\n\nTherefore, even after achieving all-time-high price points, there\u2019s still room for much more upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Is in the Shadow of Bitcoin But That May Not Last", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "Thanks to widescale institutional investment into Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), the original cryptocurrency eventually made its way above $52,000, truly a milestone moment for the blockchain economy. Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general. But you should at least know this reality before stepping forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This takes the company\u2019s total holding to 90,531 Bitcoin.\n\nAnother company that bought Bitcoin during the current market correction is Square.

However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. \n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise. \n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.\n\nEven as Binance Coin\u2019s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to turn up from 71. \n\nThe score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB\u2019s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS\u2122score, BNB price started to rally from $201. \n\nThat was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price. After a brief dip, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to strengthen from 71 and reached 80 as the price recovered to $271 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. \n\nIf the price again turns down from the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.\n\nConversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969. \n\nThe long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT). \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS\u2122 score reached 82 when DOT\u2019s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS\u2122 score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24. \n\nDOT\u2019s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.\n\nA breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.\n\nThe bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.\n\nXRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.\n\nBuying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.\n\nThe next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.\n\nThe failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions. \n\nThe LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.\n\nIf the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.\n\nChainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.\n\nThe dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears. \n\nThe sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.\n\nIf the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23. \n\nThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

"auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin. Look for Ethereum to continue to outperform Bitcoin over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully.

ETH had previously topped out at $1,420 in January 2018, but it then suffered a heavy crash during a prolonged crypto bear market. It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time. The asset has seen a new level of mainstream attention over the last few months, helped by large companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buying in.\n\nETH often rallies when BTC does, so growing belief in BTC\u2019s 'digital gold' value proposition has doubtless helped its run.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "22 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Cardano Is Set to Outpace Even the Fastest-Moving Crypto Coins", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/yEZp_IaxKRLdyg4m3KlMeA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/317be543086d8124932f3833a6ca90ad", "auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: This article was updated on Feb. 25. 2021, to correct a recent high price.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t very long ago that the Cardano\u00a0(CCC:ADA-USD) bulls struggled to maintain a dime, not to mention a dollar per coin. Today, the picture is drastically different as Cardano is quickly becoming a crypto-market darling.\n\nCould Italian physician and mathematician Girolamo Cardano possibly have known that a currency \u2013 and along with it, a grassroots movement \u2013 would bear his name someday?\n\nOf course not, but it\u2019s fun to consider the connection between the revolutionary ideas of the past and the present.\n\nAnd today, Cardano\u2019s potential as a next-generation disruptor of predecessors like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) is top-of-mind for modern-world traders. So, let\u2019s begin with an analysis of ADA\u2019s wild price action.\n\nAmong commodities traders, silver is sometimes called \u201cthe devil\u2019s metal\u201d due to its high level of volatility. Could Cardano, then, be \u201cthe devil\u2019s cryptocurrency\u201d?\n\nCardano demonstrated its moonshot potential back in late 2017 and early 2018, when it rocketed up from 2 cents to $1. Unfortunately, before the end of 2018, ADA plunged to around 3 cents.\n\nThroughout most of the next couple of years, the bulls couldn\u2019t seem to keep Cardano above 10 cents. And within the past year, Cardano slipped to a low point of approximately 2 cents.\n\nLoyal coin holders were rewarded eventually, though, as Cardano commenced a breathtaking run-up in late 2020. By the end of the year, the bulls managed to push the ADA price up to 18 cents.\n\nYet, that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. If you can believe it, the bulls bid the Cardano price back up to a 52-week high of almost $1.20. Now $2 is now a realistic price target for Cardano.\n\nCardano remains quite unique among popular cryptocurrencies. Sure, it\u2019s cheaper on a per-coin basis than Bitcoin and Ethereum, but that not the only difference.\n\nBesides being decentralized (which could be said about many cryptocurrencies), the Cardano network is known as a multi-asset smart contract platform.\n\nBy \u201cmulti-asset,\u201d I mean that multiple types of cryptocurrencies can be traded on the Cardano blockchain network. Plus, the Cardano network\u2019s use of smart contracts \u201cmeans that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum,\u201d to quote\u00a0InvestorPlace contributor\u00a0Thomas Yeung.\n\nAnd now, with the recent Goguen update, users will be able to create user-defined tokens. These will be \u201cnative\u201d custom tokens, meaning that they can be transacted directly on the blockchain.\n\nOnly time will tell, but the rollout of potentially limitless varieties of native tokens should, I believe, enhance the value of the network.\n\nI\u2019m generally not one to recommend buying an asset because a celebrity likes it.\n\nStill, I just couldn\u2019t resist relaying a news item involving Gene Simmons, the rock-star bass player of the band Kiss.\n\nReportedly, Simmons has purchased $300,000 worth of Cardano. Simmons also evidently has holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies.\n\nAt around the time the report of Simmons\u2019 big ADA purchase was released, Cardano was the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at nearly $29 billion.\n\nI\u2019m not expecting many people to buy ADA just because Simmons owns it. Rather, I believe that ADA has (pardon the pun) rock-star potential as an affordable and adaptable digital asset and network.\n\nSome folks have even proposed that Cardano could be an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t advise pitting crypto against crypto, however.\n\nThere\u2019s more than enough room for multiple successful digital currencies, and ADA is sufficiently unique to carve out its own niche.\n\nRock-star endorsements aside, Cardano is known to be a fast mover. And lately, the bulls have been in full control of ADA\u2019s price action.\n\nTherefore, even after achieving all-time-high price points, there\u2019s still room for much more upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Is in the Shadow of Bitcoin But That May Not Last", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "Thanks to widescale institutional investment into Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), the original cryptocurrency eventually made its way above $52,000, truly a milestone moment for the blockchain economy. Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general. But you should at least know this reality before stepping forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This takes the company\u2019s total holding to 90,531 Bitcoin.\n\nAnother company that bought Bitcoin during the current market correction is Square.

Glassnode data suggests that Bitcoin whales, holding between 1,000 Bitcoin to 10,000 Bitcoin and \u201chumpback whales\u201d holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin have sold more than 140,000 Bitcoin in February. \n\nIn the past, the whales swayed the crypto markets at their will.

However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. \n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise. \n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.\n\nEven as Binance Coin\u2019s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to turn up from 71. \n\nThe score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB\u2019s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS\u2122score, BNB price started to rally from $201. \n\nThat was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price. After a brief dip, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to strengthen from 71 and reached 80 as the price recovered to $271 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. \n\nIf the price again turns down from the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.\n\nConversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969. \n\nThe long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT). \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS\u2122 score reached 82 when DOT\u2019s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS\u2122 score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24. \n\nDOT\u2019s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.\n\nA breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.\n\nThe bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.\n\nXRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.\n\nBuying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.\n\nThe next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.\n\nThe failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions. \n\nThe LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.\n\nIf the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.\n\nChainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.\n\nThe dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears. \n\nThe sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.\n\nIf the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23. \n\nThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

"auther": "", "body": "Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up 96% year-to-date (YTD) to $1,431 as of today, and that\u2019s after withstanding a big fall over the last two days. In comparison, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is up just 57% to $46,345.\n\nMoreover, in the last six months, ETH is up 298% whereas Bitcoin is up 272%. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s outperformance continues over the past year. ETH is up 432% versus 367% for Bitcoin.\n\nSo, Ethereum is cheaper in terms of absolute dollars but has had superior performance versus Bitcoin over the last year. This is not likely to get overlooked by corporate treasurers. This is especially true for those that have started investing in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class.\n\nThe truth is more people might be willing to buy into a well-accepted crypt0 coin that has a lower absolute price. If someday that Ethereum will have the same price as Bitcoin has now, then owning more of ETH will bring a better return and more absolute dollars.\n\nOf course, that only is true if Ethereum actually outperforms Bitcoin. Mathematically it does not matter how many absolute crypto coins you own if it is relative performance that counts.\n\nIn the past, you had to set up an account in a special crypto wallet site like Coinbase to own cryptocurrencies. Now you can open up an account at Robinhood or Webull and own Ethereum or Bitcoin. Robinhood also now allows you to transfer in and out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is very interesting. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, especially those that do it on a hobby basis will be drawn to using Robinhood as their custodian.\n\nIt could also potentially lead corporate customers to start mining Bitcoin or Ethereum. I am just waiting for the first announcement by a major corporation that it is doing this.\n\nAnd why not? Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Coinmarketcap says that Bitcoin has now crossed over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar market value. This is based on the number of Bitcoins outstanding. But Ethereum now has $221 billion in market capitalization, a little more than a fifth of the size of Bitcoin.\n\nAs people begin to realize that there is fewer and fewer Bitcoin to purchase, hence causing a short squeeze in the price, they may not be willing to use it as a transaction currency. They will tend to store or hoard it based on future price appreciation.\n\nThe same may not be true for Ethereum. It is designed to store transactions for more than just money transactions and includes blockchain scripting for stocks and property as well. So over time, it may end up having more appeal as a real currency and transaction store than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, there is no hard cap on the total number of Ether coins that can be issued like there is with Bitcoin. This will make the currency more easily used in actual transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nI have theorized that in about seven or eight years one Ether will equal one Bitcoin in price. This assumes that Ethereum\u2019s past outperformance will continue in the future.\n\nYou can easily buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum in many brokerage accounts now. Therefore, I suggest that if you are going to diversify into Bitcoin, you also buy Ethereum. These are the two largest and likely to continue to be the most liquid and high-performing cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, I suspect that FOMO (fear of missing out) may end up overtaking many corporate boards and CFOs. They will see the profits that corporations are making by owning Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasury assets. They may not be able to afford being seen as the last to get on the train, so-to-speak, as avant-garde investors.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has no hard supply cap and that it can cover more transactions than just currency transactions will eventually raise its appeal over Bitcoin. Look for Ethereum to continue to outperform Bitcoin over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R. Hake holds a long position in Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nMark Hake writes about personal finance on mrhake.medium.com and runs the Total Yield Value Guide\u00a0which you can review\u00a0here.\n"}, {"headline": "Is Polkadot Worthy of Inclusion into Your Digital Portfolio?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "21 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/evG_ElXZZD0.UOAHrIZoCw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/08054e39b75f4eea6c141ff2bac5583b", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "We haven\u2019t even closed two months on the calendar and it already looks like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) will be the biggest story in finance for 2021. While BTC presents many possible long-term opportunities, you can\u2019t help but notice that the original cryptocurrency is a very mature asset. In other words, for a $50,000 asset to double, it would need to hit $100,000 \u2013 a tall order. That\u2019s why alternative crypto coins like Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) have captured investor interest.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, it\u2019s in the numbers. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin has gained roughly 67%. That\u2019s a great performance but it pales in comparison to Polkadot, where the underlying DOT coin has gained 255%. Moreover, it sports a price tag of around $33 at time of writing. Psychologically, this is far more appealing than BTC\u2019s $50k price tag or even the Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) token\u2019s $1,600 entry point.\n\nCertainly, psychology plays an important role in determining which assets will rise, especially in the present environment. However, the narrative for Polkadot isn\u2019t entirely narrative driven. In fact, there is a fundamental case for DOT \u2014 at least as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of the blockchain. Its textbook definition is a decentralized public distributed ledger. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nI know I\u2019m going to offend blockchain purists, but the practical explanation is that a blockchain is simply a method of record keeping that is available to the public. Conceptually, it\u2019s not dissimilar to a Google doc that you share with your work colleagues.\n\nBut one of the key differences about the blockchain is its immutable nature. Once transactions are locked into the blockchain, there is no going back and changing it. Moreover, the ability to enter data in a standard blockchain system is not confined to a central authority. Rather, data entry requires consensus among nodes or computers that store the transaction history of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for a human intermediary. Essentially, the blockchain architecture acts as its own trustworthy, immutable and perfect digital intermediary.\n\nBut like other first-to-market technologies, the original blockchain had flaws, primarily difficulty to scale and inefficient protocols. To resolve these issues, the Ethereum team developed its own blockchain that provided the scale and efficiency that developers crave.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s unique innovations brought about smart contracts. Rather than exclusively focusing on payments, other business transactions such as real estate deals or legal proceedings can benefit from digital intermediaries, thereby eliminating the middleman.\n\nHowever, even Ethereum has its issues. Long story short, the platform can get onerous for developers building complex projects. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born. Labeled as the blockchain for blockchains, Polkadot opens new efficiencies for developers by allowing multiple disparate blockchain systems to operate together.\n\nI\u2019m not doing the concept justice. But to be very simplistic, Polkadot allows developers to stack multiple blockchains together while maintaining harmonious interoperability rather than building a single unwieldy, convoluted and expensive blockchain project.\n\nArdent cryptocurrency supporters will argue that Polkadot, not Ethereum, will be the true Bitcoin alternative. It\u2019s possible that Polkadot is the most utilitarian blockchain system available. But is utility alone worth $30 billion?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the market capitalization of the underlying DOT token, which raises some interesting questions. After a robust debut, artificial intelligence and big data specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) currently sports a market cap of $49 billion, not too far off from DOT\u2019s valuation.\n\nIs Palantir\u2019s actual business and utilitarian value worth only a 63% premium over Polkadot\u2019s innovation? Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.\n\nOr consider content delivery network provider Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). It serves a critical need, particularly during this pandemic when people are working from home. FSLY has a market cap just over $8.5 billion. Is Polkadot really worth nearly four times Fastly stock?\n\nI believe the main problem with attempting fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies is that the traditional market doesn\u2019t really value platforms as much as what companies do with said platforms to solve real-world problems.\n\nAnd this is where Polkadot gets dicey \u2013 how many blockchain projects do we need? Because it\u2019s one thing to have the technology; it\u2019s quite another to do something with it.\n\nHere\u2019s my brutally honest take about Polkadot \u2013 I think it\u2019s a long-term buy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not because I think its blockchain for blockchain innovation will change the world. Because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology, someone will always come up with something better.\n\nRather, the DOT token is pure speculation based on sentiment for the cryptocurrency market. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s severe crash, the token has moved steadily higher, personally catching me by surprise. With that kind of powerful demand, you probably want to add Polkadot tokens to your digital portfolio, just in case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Before the mad rush back into crypto late last year, it traded for around 10 cents. Today? It trades at around 42 cents, after pulling back from its recent high of around 52 cents.\n\n \n\nWhile getting close to hitting all-time highs set during the last \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the party may not be over just yet.\n\nInstitutional investors so far have focused on Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), but this rising \u201caltcoin\u201d star may have a shot of eventually joining its ranks.\n\nBefore you jump into this name, keep a few things in mind. There\u2019s a solid case for the underlying utility of XLM. However, it may be a while before it earns the confidence of the \u201csmart money\u201d currently enamored with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, besides the prospects for these specific cryptos, there\u2019s the future direction of the overall crypto market to consider. It\u2019s still unclear whether the enthusiasm we are seeing now is the 21st century\u2019s answer to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s.\n\nSo far, the idea that this time it\u2019s different has remained the dominant narrative, but there\u2019s no guarantee that won\u2019t change.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here, as XLM trades around 40 cents per share? Risk-averse investors should tread carefully, but there may still be room for this crypto to run. Retail investors remain excited for the big potential gains in this and other speculative cryptos. I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch, but I wouldn\u2019t fight the trend, either.\n\nThose who have stuck just to Bitcoin have seen outstanding returns in the past few months. But, the opportunity for even more outsized gains has been found among the \u201caltcoins.\u201d Those are the smaller cryptocurrencies, that have gained a degree of legitimacy among investors\t\n\nThe \u201caltcoin\u201d most top of mind right now is Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD). As InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel wrote, traders on Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, along with Elon Musk, have fueled its stunning ten-fold rally since December.\n\nIn his analysis, Moadel made the case why Stellar Lumens could be the next Dogecoin. If the Reddit retail frenzy continues in both stocks and cryptos, I agree this remains a possibility. In fact, with its strengths, there may be a stronger bull case to be made for this crypto relative to Dogecoin, which really hasn\u2019t strayed far from its meme roots.\n\nXLM\u2019s underlying strengths alone don\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll continue to climb. But, relative to other rising \u201caltcoin\u201d stars, it seems to be the one that has the greatest shot of long-term success.\n\nWith the continued rush into Stellar Lumens, retail investors have spoken. The question now is whether institutional investors (the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d) will jump in as well. Institutional inflows have been a major factor behind the recent strong performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\t\n\nWhat does that mean? XLM needs big institutional dollar inflows to give it runway in the coming years. Will this happen? It\u2019s possible, given that there\u2019s sufficient social proof for its utility in global fund remittance.\n\nFor example, IBM (NYSE:IBM) went with Stellar\u2019s technology when it launched its World Wire project to find a faster, cheaper way to remit funds internationally.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only established company to partner with it. For example, Stripe provided some of the seed funding for the non-profit organization behind Stellar.\n\nThis utility could convince the \u201csmart money\u201d that XLM isn\u2019t just a risky crypto for Reddit traders to gamble on. The limited supply of Lumens (what the coin itself is called, Stellar refers to its network) may point to its strengths as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d Yet, so far news of institutional inflows has been limited.\n\nCrypto asset manager Greyscale has an investment vehicle offering hassle-free exposure to Stellar Lumens. However, it make take some time before Wall Street starts allocating serious money to this \u201caltcoin.\u201d\n\nGiven its potential for cross-border financial transactions, XLM has proven its utility. But, all bets are off whether the \u201csmart money\u201d begins to see this as a crypto to invest in with full force.\n\nXLM still has a small total market capitalization of around $10.75 billion, which means it may be years before XLM is ready for prime time.\n\nAs retail investor mania for both speculative stocks and speculative cryptos remains, prices could continue to rise. Those who are willing to risk big losses could find opportunity here with Stellar Lumen. However, tread carefully. More speculative coins like this one could see more dramatic declines if the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201d pops in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in Bitcoin.\n\nThomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum (ETH/USD) Falls 26% From Historic High; What's Next?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "NewsBTC", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/uODCo_yIa2bSLAfW7hCVJQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/3b47359ce0612a5c63c201d5d072d26f", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000, Setting A New All-Time High | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Crypto BriefingCryptocurrency", "body": "Ethereum's ascent continues.

It was trading as low as $80 less than a year later, a 94% drop.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the second-ranked crypto asset has been hitting new all-time highs every few days throughout January and February. $2,000 is a key psychological resistance barrier for ETH, similar to BTC\u2019s recent $50,000 milestone.\n\nThe Bitcoin price run intensified back in December when it crossed $20,000 for the first time.

Some folks actually like to view RIOT stock as a good replacement for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea here. There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning both the crypto coins and RIOT stock. Yet, not everyone wants to bother with cryptocurrency trading accounts and crypto-wallets.\n\nThat\u2019s perfectly understandable, especially if you\u2019re investing within a retirement account or another type of account in which tradable asset classes are limited.\n\nYou can buy and sell RIOT shares in many different types of investment accounts. But, should you? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms, so let\u2019s put the magnifying glass to RIOT stock and see what we come up with.\n\nSuffice it to say that the short-sellers have suffered staggering losses lately when it comes to RIOT stock. This stock appears to have magnified the gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which themselves have posted impressive returns recently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows for RIOT stockholders, however. This stock has a 52-week low of just 51 cents. That low was printed in March of 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis which put negative pressure on many asset classes.\n\nThe journey to recovery was gradual but steady for RIOT stockholders. By mid-November, the share price had already captured the $4 level. Yet, that was just the beginning of the story.\n\nNext up was a bull run of epic proportions. As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices started to gain traction, so did the RIOT stock price. By the end of 2020, the stock had already broken above $16.\n\nThen the RIOT stock bulls went into overdrive, sending the the share price above $50 and $60. The next targets for 2021 should be the psychologically significant $100 level followed by $120.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the leveraged/magnified correlation between Bitcoin and RIOT stock.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. Soon after the stock market closed on Feb. 19, the Bitcoin price was slightly above $55,500 for a 6.5% daily gain. Meanwhile, RIOT stock had posted a 15% return that day.\t\n\nI\u2019m not saying that RIOT stock will consistently double Bitcoin\u2019s daily gains. It\u2019s just that RIOT shares have the potential to extend the returns of popular cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJust be aware that RIOT stock is quite volatile. It\u2019s prone to brutal red days just as much as exhilarating green days. Hence, this stock is not appropriate for large portfolio positions.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that InvestorPlace contributor Faisal Humayun placed RIOT stock at the top of his list of seven stocks to ride the crypto wave.\n\nWhat Riot Blockchain excels at, more than anything else, is mining Bitcoins.\n\nAnd by that, I mean a whole lot of Bitcoins. Known for efficient mining operations, Riot Blockchain produced 730 newly minted Bitcoins during 2020\u2019s first nine months.\n\nBelieve it or not, Riot Blockchain plans to have 22,640 miners deployed by June of this year. That includes 15,600 model S19 Pro miners recently purchased from Bitmain.\n\nMoreover, Riot Blockchain isn\u2019t just a Bitcoin miner. It\u2019s also a blockchain-focused holding company.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain\u2019s portfolio includes cryptocurrency accounting and audit technology services provider Verady and blockchain-based escrow service\u00a0Tesspay.\n\nAs the more popular cryptocurrency tokens increase in value, RIOT stock will probably magnify the returns substantially.\n\nBesides, with robust mining operations and value-added blockchain-focused holdings, Riot Blockchain is a compelling and convenient entry point into the great big world of crypto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "XLM Makes Sense As a Bit of Fun for Investors, Play Wisely", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "23 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/92.AFCvhpev.gDKU6TWkHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/17303df2bb88789edac15b5826b1b700", "auther": "Alex Sirois ", "body": "Given the recent market hype surrounding cryptocurrency, is Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) worth a shot? Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and it\u2019s easy to argue that they represent a bubble.\u00a0\n\nMy point is that investors who choose to do so, should choose to do so wisely. The simple advice here is this: don\u2019t bet any more than you are willing to lose.\u00a0\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll step down from my soapbox now. Let\u2019s try to figure out if XLM\u2019s 500%+ price appreciation since mid-November makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAppreciation\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cryptocurrency market remains largely opaque to me. That\u2019s why I believe in using Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) as an anchor point. As the leader in the market, it should largely pull other cryptos up or down with its price movements.\u00a0 To a lesser degree, that\u2019s also true of Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD).\u00a0\n\nStellar Lumens took off out of nowhere on Nov. 19. Bitcoin began its ascent from $11k to its current price above $55k in late October. Ethereum didn\u2019t begin its recent price tripling until sometime around Christmas.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that XLM is simply the beneficiary of the larger cryptocurrency push.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like it rose somewhat independently of the market leaders.\u00a0\n\nOf course, XLM could also catch on with r/wallstreetbets, celebrities, celebrity investors, or any of the other groups who\u2019ve managed to shake up Wall Street of late. Then it could really explode.\n\nOne of the uses of Stellar Lumens, Lumens being Stellar\u2019s native token, is that you can digitize value and then issue and redeem claims on it. That means users can turn any asset into a token. The token is really a representation of that particular asset which can then be traded.\n\nThe company also has its own native currency called Lumens. The important thing to remember is that Stellar allows any asset to be\u00a0 tokenized and then traded through its platform.\u00a0\n\nStellar also allows two parties in distinct countries to make and receive payments without exchange risk or delays.\u00a0\n\nThe example the company gives on its website is one in which an American company settles a bill with a Mexican company by paying in USD tokens while the Mexican company receives Mexican Pesos. Basically, neither side can end up holding currency that they don\u2019t want as the transaction is settled as a single movement on Stellar\u2019s ledger.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently 50 billion Lumens in existence. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. When the network came online in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were issued. They aren\u2019t mined as Bitcoin is. They were simply issued at that time and then the supply was increased by 1% annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nThat policy was ended in 2019 when the total supply was limited to 50 billion for the entirety of the currency. It will not be increased according to the Stellar website.\u00a0\n\nOf the 50 billion Lumens that exist, 20 billion are currently in circulation. The Stellar Development Foundation\u00a0holds the remaining 30 billion coins. It will use them to develop and promote the currency and platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, Stellar has 4.3 million accounts using its platform. The company requires that each account hold 1 Lumen minimum. I have no idea if Stellar will grow or shrink, but it is currently one of the larger cryptos.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s current 22.46 billion coins in circulation put its market capitalization north of $11 billion. XLM currently trades above 50 cents each coin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhenever I write about crypto I try to provide as many facts as I can. Everything is obviously shaking out in the space and placing a value on a given cryptocurrency is exceedingly difficult. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much to compare against.\u00a0\n\nOne important aspect is what actual use do we as potential investors know a given cryptocurrency possesses? I laid out some of that above. I can\u2019t say that that means you should go out and buy XLM or not based on that. In fact, despite understanding a bit about XLM myself now, I believe it remains speculative at best. I feel the same about Bitcoin as well.\u00a0\n\nHonestly though, why not gamble a bit? Times are crazy. Markets are nuts. Just don\u2019t bite off more XLM than you can chew.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Cardano Is Set to Outpace Even the Fastest-Moving Crypto Coins", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/yEZp_IaxKRLdyg4m3KlMeA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/317be543086d8124932f3833a6ca90ad", "auther": "David Moadel", "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: This article was updated on Feb. 25. 2021, to correct a recent high price.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t very long ago that the Cardano\u00a0(CCC:ADA-USD) bulls struggled to maintain a dime, not to mention a dollar per coin. Today, the picture is drastically different as Cardano is quickly becoming a crypto-market darling.\n\nCould Italian physician and mathematician Girolamo Cardano possibly have known that a currency \u2013 and along with it, a grassroots movement \u2013 would bear his name someday?\n\nOf course not, but it\u2019s fun to consider the connection between the revolutionary ideas of the past and the present.\n\nAnd today, Cardano\u2019s potential as a next-generation disruptor of predecessors like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum\u00a0(CCC:ETH-USD) is top-of-mind for modern-world traders. So, let\u2019s begin with an analysis of ADA\u2019s wild price action.\n\nAmong commodities traders, silver is sometimes called \u201cthe devil\u2019s metal\u201d due to its high level of volatility. Could Cardano, then, be \u201cthe devil\u2019s cryptocurrency\u201d?\n\nCardano demonstrated its moonshot potential back in late 2017 and early 2018, when it rocketed up from 2 cents to $1. Unfortunately, before the end of 2018, ADA plunged to around 3 cents.\n\nThroughout most of the next couple of years, the bulls couldn\u2019t seem to keep Cardano above 10 cents. And within the past year, Cardano slipped to a low point of approximately 2 cents.\n\nLoyal coin holders were rewarded eventually, though, as Cardano commenced a breathtaking run-up in late 2020. By the end of the year, the bulls managed to push the ADA price up to 18 cents.\n\nYet, that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. If you can believe it, the bulls bid the Cardano price back up to a 52-week high of almost $1.20. Now $2 is now a realistic price target for Cardano.\n\nCardano remains quite unique among popular cryptocurrencies. Sure, it\u2019s cheaper on a per-coin basis than Bitcoin and Ethereum, but that not the only difference.\n\nBesides being decentralized (which could be said about many cryptocurrencies), the Cardano network is known as a multi-asset smart contract platform.\n\nBy \u201cmulti-asset,\u201d I mean that multiple types of cryptocurrencies can be traded on the Cardano blockchain network. Plus, the Cardano network\u2019s use of smart contracts \u201cmeans that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum,\u201d to quote\u00a0InvestorPlace contributor\u00a0Thomas Yeung.\n\nAnd now, with the recent Goguen update, users will be able to create user-defined tokens. These will be \u201cnative\u201d custom tokens, meaning that they can be transacted directly on the blockchain.\n\nOnly time will tell, but the rollout of potentially limitless varieties of native tokens should, I believe, enhance the value of the network.\n\nI\u2019m generally not one to recommend buying an asset because a celebrity likes it.\n\nStill, I just couldn\u2019t resist relaying a news item involving Gene Simmons, the rock-star bass player of the band Kiss.\n\nReportedly, Simmons has purchased $300,000 worth of Cardano. Simmons also evidently has holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies.\n\nAt around the time the report of Simmons\u2019 big ADA purchase was released, Cardano was the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at nearly $29 billion.\n\nI\u2019m not expecting many people to buy ADA just because Simmons owns it. Rather, I believe that ADA has (pardon the pun) rock-star potential as an affordable and adaptable digital asset and network.\n\nSome folks have even proposed that Cardano could be an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t advise pitting crypto against crypto, however.\n\nThere\u2019s more than enough room for multiple successful digital currencies, and ADA is sufficiently unique to carve out its own niche.\n\nRock-star endorsements aside, Cardano is known to be a fast mover. And lately, the bulls have been in full control of ADA\u2019s price action.\n\nTherefore, even after achieving all-time-high price points, there\u2019s still room for much more upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n"}, {"headline": "Ethereum Is in the Shadow of Bitcoin But That May Not Last", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "InvestorPlace", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/.4703XB3F6H1TGr.nCZEdA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/53a4682cc49dc561efebcc86dd75097b", "auther": "Josh Enomoto", "body": "Thanks to widescale institutional investment into Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), the original cryptocurrency eventually made its way above $52,000, truly a milestone moment for the blockchain economy. Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general. But you should at least know this reality before stepping forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

On Feb.24, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced that it had recently purchased over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) at an average rate of $52,765 per coin. This takes the company\u2019s total holding to 90,531 Bitcoin.\n\nAnother company that bought Bitcoin during the current market correction is Square. The company said it had acquired roughly \u201c3,318 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million.\u201d\n\nThese purchases by institutional investors show they are bullish on the long-term prospects of Bitcoin and believe that it is a good buy near $50,000. \n\nWhile the institutional purchases are a bullish sign, traders must also remember that for every buyer, there is a seller. Glassnode data suggests that Bitcoin whales, holding between 1,000 Bitcoin to 10,000 Bitcoin and \u201chumpback whales\u201d holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin have sold more than 140,000 Bitcoin in February. \n\nIn the past, the whales swayed the crypto markets at their will. But the entry of institutional investors has reduced their dominance. Therefore, along with the whales, traders must also keep an eye on the institutional activity.\n\nWhile large investors can buy and hold for the long-term, the smaller investor would do well to buy at the right time to make the most of the limited available capital. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s pullback from the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,323) on Feb. 22 was greeted with aggressive selling on February 23. The bears dragged the price below the channel, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows buying at lower levels.\n\nThe buyers are currently attempting to keep the BTC/USD pair inside the channel. However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. \n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise. \n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.\n\nEven as Binance Coin\u2019s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to turn up from 71. \n\nThe score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB\u2019s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS\u2122score, BNB price started to rally from $201. \n\nThat was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price. After a brief dip, the VORTECS\u2122 score started to strengthen from 71 and reached 80 as the price recovered to $271 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. \n\nIf the price again turns down from the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.\n\nConversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969. \n\nThe long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT). \n\nVORTECS\u2122 data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity\n\nThe VORTECS\u2122 score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS\u2122 score reached 82 when DOT\u2019s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS\u2122 score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24. \n\nDOT\u2019s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24. \n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.\n\nA breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.\n\nThe bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.\n\nXRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.\n\nBuying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.\n\nThe next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.\n\nThe failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions. \n\nThe LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.\n\nIf the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.\n\nChainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.\n\nThe dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears. \n\nThe sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.\n\nIf the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23. \n\nThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.
