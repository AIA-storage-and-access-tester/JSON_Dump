Ask them about cryptocurrency predictions for 2021. As Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), XRP (CCC:XRP-USD) and others have rocketed in value, never before has Wall Street seemed so hesitant about \u201cdigital gold,\u201d a name they use to invoke a margin of safety.\n\nBut as any experienced crypto investor knows, that\u2019s not the way cryptocurrencies work. Instead, it\u2019s a digital popularity contest where winners keep winning and losers bite the dust.\n\nSo, which cryptocurrencies can make you rich in 2021?\n\nTo answer that question, we need to explore the world of altcoins \u2014 up-and-coming coins that you can buy for cheap. That\u2019s because it pays to get in early. For example, $1,000 invested in Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) would be worth $3.3 million today. Meanwhile, $1,000 invested in Bitcoin today might earn \u201cjust\u201d 4-5x upside if you believe JP Morgan\u2019s lofty $146,000 target price.\n\nBut there are also significant risks because cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. Instead, their worth comes from their users. The more users a coin has, the more useful it becomes, and the higher its price goes. But when a coin falls out of favor, there\u2019s nothing to stop it from going to zero. That means investing in cryptocurrency requires strong belief that others will eventually buy it from you for even more.\n\nToday, people invest in crypto for one reason alone: to make money. So far, cryptocurrencies have delivered on that promise. Mom-and-pop investors have profited handsomely as Bitcoin and other currencies have rocketed in value.\n\nBut the risks in 2021 are growing \u2014 at their core, cryptocurrencies only serve to transfer wealth from one party to another. And some new competitors have recently popped up.\n\n\u201cChina has already developed a Central Bank-backed crypto, and in the U.S. it was discussed as part of the C-19 stimulus,\u201d writes Laura Gonzalez, Ph.D., associate professor of Finance at California State University, Long Beach. \u201cThere is ample evidence of speculation as well, and the value of the current cryptos will be affected by the upcoming central-bank backed digital currencies.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unregulated cryptocurrencies will one day compete against state-sponsored ones too.\n\nHere\u2019s the takeaway: if you have an extremely conservative portfolio and need to add \u201crisk-on\u201d assets, choosing a basket of top-rated cryptocurrencies could be right for you. It\u2019s a cheap way to gain massive macroeconomic risk exposure. But don\u2019t get fooled by thinking of crypto as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d If 2021 sees a surprise economic slowdown, no amount of hope will keep crypto afloat.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to take those risks, then you might want to start your search with the top 28 cryptocurrencies you need to know for 2021:\n\nWhile each has enormous potential, some are safer bets than others. As such, I\u2019ve organized the cryptocurrencies based on their overall risk-to-reward potential from most balanced to least. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at the wild world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum is a relative newcomer that has risen up the ranks thanks to its superior technology and its ability to create \u201csmart contracts.\u201d\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $200 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: $102020 Return: 470%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nEther, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is a technologically advanced version of Bitcoin that stands to grow even faster. Rather than hold itself as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d Ethereum runs on a series of contracts. That makes it more like Google Wallet or Apple Pay \u2014 a system that can approve or delay transactions based on real-world events. Online buyers and sellers, for instance, could set up trades that only follow through when the postal service independently verifies the delivery of goods.\n\nEthereum is also blazingly fast compared to Bitcoin: transactions only take 15 seconds to clear, rather than 15 minutes. Although trading costs are still high, its speed makes Ethereum useful for real-time use, rather than only as a store of value. Finally, Ethereum also has widespread adoption, with over 600,000 wallet addresses in use. As developers add services and protocols to make cryptocurrencies more useful, Ethereum looks set to keep winning.\n\nThese qualities have pushed Ethereum to my No. 1 spot in terms of risk-to-reward potential. Despite it having a later start than many other currencies, it has a winning combination of widespread usage, technological superiority and relative safety (compared to smaller coins, at least).\n\nBitcoin is the most widely adopted cryptocurrency. Although it\u2019s not the most technologically advanced, it continues to lead the pack.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $920 billionYear Established: 2009Cost Per Transaction: $152020 Return: 309%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe first successful cryptocurrency continues to lead the pack. With its first-mover advantage, Bitcoin not only won early name recognition. It also became the de-facto cryptocurrency for mainstream investors. Smaller investors can use Square (NYSE:SQ) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) services to buy as little as $1 (or as much as they can \u201chodl\u201d). Meanwhile, institutional investors can use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to transact millions of dollars in futures.\n\nThat makes Bitcoin an essential allocation. The world\u2019s No. 1 coin makes up close to two-thirds of the entire cryptocurrency market, providing liquidity between smaller altcoins. Its size also makes it resistant to 51% attacks, where large cryptocurrency miners attempt to use computing heft to try manipulating the blockchain.\n\nHowever, popular as it may be, Bitcoin has some downsides. As one of the earliest blockchains, Bitcoin\u2019s ledger is large and unwieldy. Transactions can cost $12 to complete and take over 15 minutes to clear. That\u2019s fine for its purpose as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d but it prevents BTC from use as a day-to-day currency. (People paying in Bitcoin will often use third-party services to transact small amounts).\n\nBitcoin is also extremely sensitive to macroeconomic movements \u2014 the currency lost half its value in the most recent U.S. stock market downturn. And if 2021 reveals a weak economic recovery or mutated strain of the novel coronavirus, Bitcoin could easily lose 50-80% of its value. But for those looking to invest in cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the most liquid option. It\u2019s an essential coin to hold, and one that receives top marks for in 2021.\n\nXRP is a centralized cryptocurrency that\u2019s geared toward taking out the high costs of inter-bank transfers.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $24 billionYear Established: 2012Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 16%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIf you could only bet on one cryptocurrency this year, XRP would be it. XRP is the largest currency to have 10x potential for 2021.\n\nXRP is the odd duckling of the cryptocurrency world. Founded by Ripple Labs, XRP is a centralized currency that\u2019s mined, managed and administered by Ripple Labs (instead of a broad-based community). On one hand, that gives the coin the benefits of Visa (NYSE:V) and other centralized payments processors. These include the ability to negotiate with large banks, execute trades quickly and control policies.\n\nOn the other hand, critics are right to question: \u201cWhy use a cryptocurrency in the first place then?\u201d\n\nXRP has also had its share of accounting issues. Specifically, in December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and two executives for selling XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Ripple also controls over half of the XRP supply.\n\nStill, XRP has enormous potential. The currency is used by financial institutions as an alternative to the SWIFT network, giving it a real-world application. And its low price-per-coin makes it a tempting target for punters \u2014 it\u2019s easier to see XRP rising 1,000% to $3.5 than BTC doing the same to $454,000.\n\nA well-placed contender to XRP\u2019s crown, Stellar offers low-cost, cross-border transactions.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $11 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 189%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n2021 is shaping to become Stellar\u2019s year. After lagging Bitcoin in 2020, Stellar surprised analysts and investors alike by rocketing 200% in the first week of January. The coin has continued to outperform expectations since.\n\nMuch of its success comes from XRP\u2019s misfortunes. Much like XRP, Stellar was designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. As regulatory issues mount for rival XRP, Stellar has quickly moved to fill the void. But some of it has also come down to luck. In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowed banks to start using independent node verification networks. The same week, the Ukrainian government announced a partnership with Stellar Development to create a national digital currency.\n\nAll this grants perfect investment conditions for Stellar, a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nCardano is the largest third-generation cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s packed with plenty more upside potential in 2021.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 441%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nADA, which runs on the Cardano network is one of the most technologically exciting cryptocurrencies to date. Its proof-of-stake system means it can operate more efficiently than the standard proof-of-work system. And its use of smart contracts means that it can keep track of transactions like bitcoin while handling payments like Ethereum. In short, it\u2019s a third-generation coin that improves on its predecessors.\n\nADA/Cardano still has plenty of work to do in the year ahead. After all, having a superior technological product means nothing if people won\u2019t adopt it. But three key areas make it a top cryptocurrency for 2021.\n\nFirst, ADA has momentum. The currency took just three years to hit a $10 billion market cap \u2014 one-third the time it took Bitcoin to do the same. Second, it sits at just 30 cents per coin, making it a tempting target for punters to run up. Finally, it has the ability to handle transactions and smart contracts. This makes it a natural enhancement for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nAn internet meme turned cryptocurrency, Dogecoin teaches the world about making money.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $7 billionYear Established: 2013Cost Per Transaction: 3 cents2020 Return: 118%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2013, IBM (NYSE:IBM) software engineer Billy Markus founded Dogecoin as a meme joke. And like most memes, Dogecoin saw its 15 minutes of fame. In 2017, DOGE briefly rocketed 85,000% as the internet found its new amusement; it subsequently lost 98% of its value.\n\nBut in the world of cryptocurrencies and memes alike, second acts DO exist. In December 2020, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sent Dogecoin back up 200% in a week simply by tweeting about it. As 2021 rolls around, this newfound popularity could send the coin up to speculative heights. Dogecoin does have its merits: its faster block time makes it better at processing payments than Bitcoin can. But in an asset class where popularity trounces usability any day of the week, Dogecoin could quickly return 1,000%.\n\nJust make sure you take your profits.\n\nAlong with Cardano/ADA, Polkadot is another promising third-generation cryptocurrency to consider.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $27 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 205%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn December, Binance announced a $10 million fund to support projects on Polkadot, a new cryptocurrency. DOT\u2019s price shot up 41% within a week. And more gains could be on the way.\n\nFounded by Gavin Wood, the Chief Technology Officer of the Ethereum Project, its protocol improves on older blockchains. From a technological standpoint, Polkadot\u2019s key difference is its use of parachains \u2014 multiple blockchains that can run in parallel. That solves a massive issue for Bitcoin, which has a single, growing blockchain that all miners (and transactors) need to store. Developers have also added scalability, smart contracts and security.\n\nStill, investors need to remember that, in the world of cryptocurrencies, the best technologies aren\u2019t always the winners \u2014 it will take strong marketing (and some luck) to get Polkadot to rival its larger competitors.\n\nNEO \u2014 \u201cthe Chinese Ethereum\u201d \u2014 looks set to shine if the Chinese Communist Party allows it.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $3 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 63%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by NEO\u2019s sleepy looking returns in 2020. NEO (formerly known as Antshares) is one of China\u2019s earliest and largest cryptocurrency ventures. The coin fell hard in 2018 as the Chinese government cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges. But in 2021, the coin staged a remarkable resurgence as Chinese regulators turned their ire to Ant Group, a payments processor.\n\nWith the Chinese Communist Party now rethinking its stance on cryptocurrencies, NEO has a chance to shine once again.\n\nLender Celsius is a cryptocurrency with the potential to become a bank.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2018Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 3,717%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 2018, Celsius Network crowdfunded $20 million to create a cryptocurrency lending platform. Since then, the network has written $6.2 billion in loans and produced $11 million in interest income, making it more like a bank than a currency. And by registering as an exempt issuer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Celsius has soared even as other regulatory related currencies like XRP have struggled. In fact, its 2020 return was one of the highest of any other coin.\n\nStill, Celsius has plenty of risk for potential investors. As companies from Bear Stearns to Lehman Brothers found, bad loans can quickly threaten the stability of an entire lending operation. And the Celsius Network has raised red flags in the past, particularly with its unclear collateral requirements. In other words, Celsius could also blow up like a bank if they don\u2019t have the right controls in place.\n\nNevertheless, CEL could still continue to rise. It\u2019s one of the largest pure-play P2P lenders in the crypto space, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in 2021.\n\nWant to have your own blockchain? Nano gives every user their own ledger.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: <$1 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: N/A2020 Return: 54%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nNano is a prime example of playing the cryptocurrency lottery. Having traded sideways in 2020, Nano suddenly jumped 400% in the first week of 2021. Why? Some may point to a December hack on an Italian cryptocurrency exchange. Others might point to Nano\u2019s reasonably superior technology. But in the microcap altcoin world, timing has far more to do with luck.\n\nHowever, now that demand is rising, keep watch. A short-term spike is often how new coins gain popularity. With its ability to assign entire blockchains to individual accounts, Nano looks like an attractive Bitcoin alternative.\n\nChainlink is a cryptocurrency that allows others to run smart contracts. But can LINK succeed on its own?\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $13 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 428%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nChainlink is as different as they come. Rather than operate its own blockchain, Chainlink runs smart contracts on other blockchains. That makes LINK an anomaly in the cryptocurrency world \u2014 a coin that\u2019s relatively agnostic to whichever blockchain it\u2019s working on. It\u2019s a formula that sounds good in theory.\n\nFrom an investor standpoint, however, Chainlink\u2019s complexity has worked against it. Making use of the protocol still requires hardcore programming knowledge, and that shrinks its potential audience. What Chainlink needs is a strong sponsor \u2014 a business like Ripple Labs, for example \u2014 to market and implement its smart contracts as required.\n\nIf the currency can find that sponsor, LINK will soar. Otherwise, investors can expect the currency to stall in 2021 as newer smart-contract coins take over.\n\nLisk is an early delegated proof-of-stake coin that was bested by competitors. Can it regain its strength?\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: <$1 billionYear Established: 2016Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 104%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nLisk was launched in 2016 to a great deal of optimism. The delegated proof-of-stake coin initially priced at $8 as excited ICO investors saw LSK as an alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s issues. Built on JavaScript, one of the most common programming languages, Lisk promised to open application developments to a far wider range of developers.\n\nThe optimism, however, didn\u2019t last. As Lisk\u2019s programming issues began to emerge, the coin\u2019s price began to sink \u2014 certain quirks in its programming language made it relatively inefficient and prone to non-deterministic behavior. By 2017, LSK had shed almost all its value to settle at just 10 cents. And despite a second massive run-up in the 2018 cryptocurrency bubble, the coin has since settled back, dropping off the top-100 coin charts by market cap.\n\nInterest in the coin, however, has refused to completely disappear. Earlier this year, Robinhood added Lisk to its list of tracked cryptocurrencies, sending prices up over 250%. That means, while Lisk might have significant technological issues, renewed interest in the coin could incentivize developers back to the drawing board to improve the coin. If that happens (and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d), Lisk could quickly regain strength and challenge the larger coins once again.\n\nMonero is the No. 1 privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\n\nApproximate Market Cap: $4 billionYear Established: 2014Cost Per Transaction: 4 cents2020 Return: 244%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMonero has long been a favored coin for its privacy applications. Unlike Bitcoin, Monero\u2019s public ledger is obscured \u2014 outsiders can\u2019t use its blockchain to trace the source, destination or amount of any transaction. And its community has continued to improve its privacy \u2014 from improving its decoy transactions to obscuring recipient identities.\n\nBut Monero ran into early issues. Because transactions are so private, it quickly became a favorite of Darknet users looking to hide their tracks. After suffering a series of scandals, XMR\u2019s price plummeted in 2017. Yet, the cryptocurrency has had a revival in recent months. Since February, the currency has increased by almost 300% as privacy concerns have taken center stage.\n\nAs we move into 2021, XMR looks like a cryptocurrency with second-wind potential. Investors should take note.\n\nOMG is a coin built on the Ethereum network looks set to ride ETH\u2019s coattails\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 280%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nFounded in 2017, OMG Network was built to help Ethereum gain scale. Rather than run every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, the OMG network would use sidechains to group several transactions together before sending them to the main blockchain. These transactions are secured by OMG Network\u2019s coin, OMG.\n\nDespite its relative promise, however, investor interest in the OMG Network has been muted. Like Dai/MakerDAO and other cryptocurrencies that rely on other blockchains, OMG has had trouble raising enough interest to create life of its own. Still, it\u2019s one of the handful of coins Robinhood tracks, making it a potential smaller break-out coin for 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t expect fireworks. But with enough investor interest from Robinhood, don\u2019t expect OMG to disappear entirely either.\n\nQTUM brings an advanced version of smart contracts to market.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $1 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: Nominal2020 Return: 44%Score: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn many ways, QTUM looks much like Lisk \u2014 a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency that combines the best of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. And like Lisk, QTUM was thrust back into the spotlight this year after trading app Robinhood added the coin to its list of tracked currencies. By the second week of February, QTUM had risen 270%.\n\nBut there\u2019s where the similarities begin to end. Unlike Lisk, which is written in the more-commonly used JavaScript, QTUM is written in far faster C. That has allowed its community to develop strong protocols that have kept up with many of Bitcoin\u2019s own modifications.\n\nQTUM remains a niche coin \u2014 as of the beginning of 2021, the cryptocurrency remains outside the top-50 by market cap. But as investors start to look further afield for interesting technologies, QTUM could see its moment to shine.\n\nWith its value linked 1:1 to the U.S. Dollar, Tether is useful for short-term holdings.

That means no matter how high or low other cryptocurrencies go, Tether will theoretically stay at $1. That makes Tether useful as 1) a currency, 2) a short-term savings tool and 3) a method of arbitrage between different exchanges.\n\nAs a long-term investment, however, it\u2019s not particularly interesting. Tether\u2019s value won\u2019t ever deviate far from $1. Past accounting scandals have also threatened the coin\u2019s stability. In 2017, the coin dropped to 92 cents, and controversy seems to keep cropping up every couple of months.\n\nNevertheless, Tether is still useful for transferring cryptocurrency between wallets without major price risk. And with many exchanges now offering up to 12% interest on stablecoins, it\u2019s a currency that still shouldn\u2019t get overlooked in 2021.\n\nAs the largest \u201cBitcoin clone,\u201d Litecoin still hasn\u2019t managed a life of its own.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $8 billionYear Established: 2011Cost Per Transaction: 7 cents2020 Return: 200%Score: \u2605\u2605\n\nLitecoin is the largest of the \u201cBitcoin clones,\u201d making it far more understandable for most investors. Its founder, a former Google engineer, designed Litecoin by using Bitcoin\u2019s original codebase and modifying it to create blocks four times faster. That has made the younger fork cheaper and faster than Bitcoin to verify. Litecoin\u2019s size also makes it less vulnerable to a \u201c51% attack\u201d than other Bitcoin-like currencies.\n\nMy two-star rating comes down to momentum. Although it was once a popular Bitcoin alternative, Litecoin has since struggled to differentiate itself from its bigger brother. While it could be a good holding for 2021, it\u2019s going to ride Bitcoin\u2019s success rather than shine on its own.\n\nBinance\u2019s homegrown coin has use on its platform, but not much else.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $5 billionYear Established: 2017Cost Per Transaction: N/A2020 Return: 160%Score: \u2605\u2605\n\nBinance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, launched its own currency to reduce transaction costs.

That\u2019s because BNB\u2019s value rests on Binance\u2019s ability to draw more users. In October, Forbes staff released documents alleging that Binance and its founder created an elaborate corporate structure designed to deceive U.S. regulators.\n\nWith friends like that, who needs enemies?\n\nNEM is a speculative cryptocurrency that is still hanging on for its life after a massive 2017 theft.\n\n \n\nApproximate Market Cap: $2 billionYear Established: 2015Cost Per Transaction: 13 cents2020 Return: 512%Score: \u2605\u2605\n\nNEM, or New Economy Movement, was designed as an alternative to \u201cmainstream\u201d Bitcoin.

But today, it\u2019s a shadow of its former self.\n\nIn 2017, as concerns over Bitcoin\u2019s scalability mounted, Amaury Sechet and a group of programmers released Bitcoin Cash to compete. With a 10-minute block time and larger block sizes, BCH can theoretically process more transactions per second than its older rival.\n\nFrom an investment standpoint, however, the fork has been a massive disappointment. Its improvements proved far too minor to excite investors, sending the price of BCH spiraling from a $4,355 peak in 2017 to just $700 or so today. Although BCH will likely ride Bitcoin\u2019s coattails in the near-term, the coin remains a shadow of its former self. My recommendation?

Put another way, the proverbial $1,000 invested in Ethereum last year would now be worth about $7,000.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Source: Shutterstock\n\n\nIn early February, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) introduced futures contracts in Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, which started in 2015 as a programmable blockchain. Such futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell Ether at a predetermined price at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace\u00a0contributor Vivian Medithi covered the topic earlier this month and highlighted, \u201cAnalysts expect to see increased institutional investment in ether as a result of the introduction of futures contracts, bolstering the recent bullish run in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s move comes about three years after its December 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures. At the time, BTC was around $18,000. Now Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000. However, the run-up in BTC has not been smooth. Therefore, if history is any guide, we can expect volatility in the ETH price, too.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization (cap) currently stands around $217 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $966 billion. So, what is driving the value increase of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole?\n\nAs recent research led by Seoung Kyun Kim at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights, \u201cThe flexibility offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts has attracted many users, developers, and investors, leading Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTherefore despite short-term volatility, given investors\u2019 risk appetite in cryptocurrencies, it is likely that Ethereum will see $2,000 sooner than later.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based software platform. This technology is advanced, and has many uses beyond the storing and recording of transactions. Ether is the actual cryptocurrency that is bought and sold, and is what the Ethereum software is built around. Ethereum is currently the most actively used blockchain. This is a main reason why some think Ether could hold tangible value, as it is based on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is: \u201ca community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today\u2026 Ethereum builds on Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets \u2014 even Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nAnother difference between a coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum is the supply and the volume in circulation. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, with 2.3 million currently left to mine. Ether has over 100 million in supply, but currently has no fixed number, meaning more can be produced. There have been talks of introducing a limit but nothing at this time is announced. Thus, the flexibility of supply is a feature that appeals to some investors.\n\nAlso, many celebrities have announced they have large shares in various cryptocurrencies. People with powerful voices have pumped these cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even coins with a relatively small tangible value or purpose \u2014 such as Dogecoin\u00a0(CCC:DOGE-USD) \u2014\u00a0have been caught up in this movement. Furthermore, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, around the world, national debt levels are piling up. Meanwhile, interest rates are record low levels. Therefore a large number of investors are looking at cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth, similar to that offered by gold.\n\nAs a young and evolving financial asset, the price of Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies is volatile. Given the increase in value in the past 12 months, ETH is likely to be choppy in the short-run as some investors may decide to ring the cash register.\n\nEvery time I look at a ETH or BTC price chart, I notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, daily swings are wide and the direction of the next move is usually surprising.\n\nYet, the past year has witnessed more individuals and firms bring cryptocurrencies into their lives and businesses. Now, these digital currencies are accepted by more people. As a result, I am expecting the growth in cryptos to continue in general.\u00a0\n\nThere is growing consensus that a network like Ethereum and a coin like Ether could be the long-term future of transacting. Many analysts believe ETH can test the $2,000 mark soon. So as a small allocation to a portfolio, it could be worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

A Shiba Inu-themed cryptocurrency that was the brainchild of two software engineers has taken the investing world by storm. After years of being overshadowed by more popular coins like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) and Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD), Dogecoin got its turn in the spotlight after Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) billionaire boss tweeted \u201cWho let the Doge out.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 29 the currency was up 800%, becoming the \u201ccrypto (GameStop (NYSE:GME) gme\u201d according to one Reddit user. A seemingly unknown coin now has the internet abuzz. If there\u2019s one lesson we can learn from this, it\u2019s that memes and tweets have the power to move markets.\n\nAlthough many may have heard about Dogecoin for the first time in the last couple of weeks, the cryptocurrency has actually been around since 2013. The coin was the product of a joke by two software engineers who wanted to pay homage to Bitcoin\u2019s then-questionable reputation. A coin that meant to garner nothing more than a few laughs has now become the face of the cryptocurrency industry. Its claim to fame is the result of a series of tweets and memes.\n\nFor reasons that still remain unclear, Dogecoin caught the attention of billionaire Elon Musk. Tesla\u2019s tenacious CEO took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to tweet about the coin, writing \u201cno highs, no lows, only Doge\u201d along with a Lion King meme with the Shiba Inu dog on Simba\u2019s face.\n\nNot long after this, Dogecoin\u2019s price skyrocketed, surging more than 800% in 24 hours. Other billionaires and pop culture icons like Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg got in on the action, tweeting about the currency as well.\n\nDogecoin is proof of the radical shift in market power with people participating in the rally for a sense of community. Although the coin has no intrinsic value like stocks or bonds, investors are rallying together to get its value to $1. The Dogecoin phenomenon is a case study in how culture and technology have the ability to literally move markets. Just as we saw in GameStop stock\u2019s meteoric rally last month.\n\nDogecoin has dipped 20% since its Feb. 7 high of 0.087159. Nevertheless, the currency is still up 1,350% this year with a market value of $8 billion. While many have expressed enthusiasm about the currency, others remain cautious.\n\nAn article by MarketWatch explains that unlike traditional Bitcoin which is limited in supply, Dogecoin has no built-in limit. This means that it can be mined for hundreds or thousands at any given time. Ultimately, the currency value is the result of a mass-market movement that remains untethered.\n\nSo the currency, as it stands, is largely speculative. Billy Markus, the founder of Dogecoin, recently stated the rally is \u201cnot something (he) can comprehend.\u201d He likened the rally to that of stocks like GameStop and AMC (NYSE:AMC) \u2014 both of which have cooled down considerably from their highs. Many researchers have also urged investors to exercise greater caution when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin.\n\nThe rise in the currency\u2019s price can serve as a real temptation to investors but its long-term growth remains unsustainable. On one hand, the currency is a great investment alternative in an environment where interest rates are close to zero. But on the flip side, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional investments, Bitcoin is disproportionately controlled with 95% of the currency controlled by just 2% of the market.\n\nThe recent rally in Dogecoin is a testament to the power of memes. While the price spikes are definitely attractive, it\u2019s also worth noting that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. According to Garrick Hileman of blockchain.com, Dogecoin could lose 90% of its value.\n\nWith this being a real possibility (as we saw with GME and AMC stock), I wouldn\u2019t go all-in on Dogecoin. However, if you want to be a part of the mass market movement, Dogecoin does trade on the cheap and is worth a small investment. Even if things don\u2019t go your way, it could serve as a great learning opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya Premkumar has a finance degree from the University of Houston, Texas.

Then there are Square (NYSE:SQ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Those titans of finance are some of today\u2019s early large cap adopters of the crypto market.

At the same time Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) announced they\u2019ll begin allowing various financial transactions in select crypto coins.\n\nThe writing appears to be on the wall. Even in the face of stricter future oversight, digital currencies promise to continue providing very lucrative investment opportunities. A word to the wise before jumping in is warranted.\n\nAs we\u2019ve witnessed throughout crypto\u2019s re-emergence to all-time-highs, investors still need to be prepared for wild price action which can induce second-guessing, run-for-the-exits sell orders at the expense of one\u2019s trading account.

According to Yahoo Finance the company engages in Bitcoin mining and recently changed its name from Golden Bull to better reflect its business activities. Despite being a fairly new entrant into the space, New York-based BTBT is one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies listed on Nasdaq.\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m always suspect of a company name change and business pivot of this kind. And being lured into a long stock position by year-over-year quarterly sales growth of around 64,000% isn\u2019t a great idea. The fact is revenues for the latest period came in at $13 million compared to a valuation of nearly $850 million for this crypto. It\u2019s steep. Bit Digital also remains in the red.\n\nStill, investors are buying in to the BTBT stock story in a big way and it looks worthy of calculated exposure.\n\nTechnically, Bit Digital recently broke out of a massive corrective cup-shaped base to new all-time-highs to finish off 2020. To complement that bullish price action, in 2021 shares of this crypto have put together a well-supported test of the stock\u2019s prior high.\n\nBTBT has pulled back near its 50% retracement level within a smaller corrective \u2018V-shaped\u2019 base. And coupled with a favorable bullish stochastics crossover, this crypto looks ready for buying into.\n\nFavored Strategy: May $25/$40 Bull Call Spread\n\n\nSource: Charts by TradingView\n\nRiot Blockchain is the next of our crypto stocks to buy. RIOT was one of the digital currency market\u2019s more notorious listed stocks during the asset group\u2019s 2017 \u2013 2018 run-up and subsequent crash. And like BTBT, this diversified blockchain play seemingly came out of nowhere, pivoting and changing its corporate name. It was suspect to say the least. Today however, it\u2019s time to let bygones be bygones.\n\nTechnically, this crypto stock has just taken out its own bubble high. Even a minor correction could cause RIOT stock investors to blink or more aptly, barf, given the stock\u2019s underlying volatility. As much, playing for continued momentum while maintaining ironclad downside risk is the way to position.\n\nFavored Strategy: March $55/$65 Bull Call Spread\n\n\nSource: Charts by TradingView\n\nCanaan is the last of our crypto stocks to buy.

With the stock jumping past the 76% retracement level and weekly stochastics signaling a bullish crossover in neutral territory, a bit of strategic exposure to this crypto looks ripe today.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong? Let\u2019s not find out. At the same time, investors might consider using CAN\u2019s less desirable price volatility to their advantage by hedging a purchase of this crypto stock with a defined risk and highly flexible collar strategy.\n\nFavored Strategy: April $10/$20 Collar\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Tyler holds, directly or indirectly, positions in listed Bitcoin and Ethereum stocks (GBTC, ETHE and ETCG), but no other securities mentioned in this article.\n\nChris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

Patrick Hughes put his side-by-side bars in Manhattan\u2019s Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Scruffy Duffy's and Hellcat Annie's, up for sale in January.\n\nThe asking price? Twenty-five bitcoin (BTC-USD), or about $1.4 million at the current price. He\u2019ll also accept 800 ethereum (ETH-USD) tokens, which values the bars at nearly $1.6 million.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI guess my point was that it was something new to attract a different type of buyer, get a little publicity, try to legitimize the currency a little bit,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance Live. Hughes said he would accept U.S. dollars for the bars \u2014 he just prefers bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise. It\u2019s up 60% in the month of February alone, reaching an all-time high above $55,000 \u2014 giving the cryptocurrency a market value of more than $1 trillion. Citigroup predicts it could hit $318,000 by the end of 2021 Bitcoin got a big boost after Tesla disclosed it invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency, which is also attracting interest from financial institutions. Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins.\n\n\u201cI might have to cut the price a little bit,\u201d Hughes joked. \u201cSo maybe instead of 25 bitcoins, perhaps 10 bitcoins? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHughes said he hasn\u2019t received any bitcoin offers yet for his bars, but he admits he\u2019s gotten a lot of publicity, which he claims could be one of the reasons why the price is going up. \u201cPerhaps I helped drive the price of this bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first put this [idea] out there in early January, the price of a bitcoin was $30,000.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn case you were wondering, Hughes is a cryptocurrency investor. He bought bitcoin early on and sold all of his holdings when it hit $51,000 earlier this month and then immediately bought the competing cryptocurrency, ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt's all going to be cryptocurrency eventually and I don't want to be holding U.S. dollars in a few years when inflation rears its ugly head again. Because it's coming,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, his bars had a combined staff of 50 people. That\u2019s now down to seven. While Scruffy Duffy\u2019s remains closed since March because of bar seating restrictions due to COVID-19, Hellcat Annie\u2019s reopened in November with outdoor dining.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe're almost back to pre-pandemic levels with the outdoor,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAnd now with the 25% capacity indoor, I'll be able to keep that place afloat.\u201d\n\nHughes said after 30 years in the restaurant industry he\u2019s \u201cexhausted\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nIf he successfully sells his bars for bitcoin, Hughes could make history as the first known cryptocurrency restaurant sale in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI'd like to leave this business at the top of my game and to make a big splash, make a little history, and just go out on top. So I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin,\" he said. \"I think it would be awesome.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is an anchor for Yahoo Finance.

Though BTC did give up some of its gains at time of writing, enthusiasm remains sky high. But what about alternative crypto coins (altcoins) like Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)? Is there any benefit to wagering on ETH, or should investors ride the main show?\n\n \n\nOn principle, the narrative overwhelmingly favors Bitcoin. While many altcoins have made a splash, and the underlying blockchain technology of Ethereum is commendable, the reality is that most institutional players are just warming up to BTC.\n\nBefore you attempt to push the relationship to the next level, the institutions would prefer you to take them out to dinner first. In other words, one step at a time.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not really hearing too much about Ethereum \u2013 the only altcoin so far with a market capitalization of at least $200 billion. Instead, it\u2019s all about Bitcoin. As the Wall Street Journal detailed, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stated that it will treat BTC as any other financial asset. Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) declared that it will integrate Bitcoin into its payment network this year.\n\nOf course, you have Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Musk has been responsible for some wild swings in the crypto space. Moreover, Tesla revealed that it purchased $1.5 billion of BTC. This is in line with other technologically savvy corporations like Square (NYSE:SQ) buying up the token, though Tesla\u2019s purchase magnitude has shot up Bitcoin\u2019s credibility to the moon.\n\nWhile amazing for the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies, it all seems BTC-centric. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on Ethereum as the narrative may be more exciting for it down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to technological innovations, it usually pays to be first. But with cryptocurrencies, that might not be the case.\n\nYes, Bitcoin clearly enjoys the benefits of being first to market. And let\u2019s face it \u2013 from a marketing perspective, the name stands out positively because of its elemental elegance. On the flipside, Ethereum sounds like the currency of the Star Trek universe \u2013 cool but a bit esoteric.\n\nMore importantly, though, Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s proof of concept and addresses issues that have plagued the original token\u2019s aim to become the internet\u2019s currency of choice. Due to a comparatively clunky infrastructure and difficulty of scalability, Bitcoin has instead become the blockchain\u2019s lab queen.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s a store of value, something that you keep tucked away like a precious metal. Of course, this dynamic prevents BTC from being an effective, widely used virtual currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum doesn\u2019t share this problem. Fostering innovations such as proof of stake mining protocols \u2013 which rewards engagement of the ETH platform over outright computing power in the supply building process known as crypto mining \u2013 and smart contracts which theoretically eliminate human intermediaries in business/legal transactions, Ethereum hands down offers superior utility.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies become as mainstream as say smart device payment transactions, ETH has a viable path to incredible profitability, probably more so than BTC.\n\nAs for institutions preferring Bitcoin, that may not necessarily be a slight against Ethereum. Yes, it\u2019s a distraction for the time being. However, you have to understand the psychology of the marketplace. It\u2019s much easier for newcomers to invest in ETH (or other attractively priced altcoins) and acquire whole \u201cequity\u201d units.\n\nAt more than 50 grand a pop, you can\u2019t really say that about Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, what I said above shouldn\u2019t be considered an open invitation to buy Ethereum willy-nilly. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Therefore, you must perform due diligence before even thinking about getting involved.\n\nWhile I support the longer-term thesis of virtual currencies, as institutions put digital assets into their balance sheets, the pressure has ratcheted up enormously. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 the big boys are getting into this arena very late into the game.\n\nHow much more will Bitcoin rise? What\u2019s different about this rally compared to prior run-ups is the law of large numbers. BTC truly captured mainstream attention when it jumped from a $1,000 peak price point to just under $20,000 in late 2017. Obviously, that\u2019s a 20-bagger.\n\nThis time, we\u2019re making a huge fuss about BTC again as the price went from $20,000 to $50,000. That\u2019s a 2.5-bagger, which is great but not a 20-bagger.\n\nShould a correction occur in the stock market, there will be additional pressure for institutional players to dump out of Bitcoin to salvage something from the red ink. Put another way, crypto volatility isn\u2019t the only thing you must worry about in this space. The stock market is another variable, perhaps the variable to focus on.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scare you away from Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general. But you should at least know this reality before stepping forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC and ETH.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Rally Supported By Rise In PMI\n\nCAD Unfazed By Weaker Retail Sales\n\nThere were some big moves in currencies on Friday, which was no surprise given the busy economic calendar. GBP/USD rose above 1.40 for the first time since April 2018, while AUD/USD and NZD/USD climbed to their strongest level since March 2018. Investors looked past softer economic reports in favor of stronger releases. The U.S. dollar sold off across the board as stocks rebounded from yesterday\u2019s decline. Existing home sales and PMIs were stronger.\n\nDespite surging virus cases and widespread restrictions in the U.S. and Europe, manufacturing activity continues to chug along.\u00a0The hope is that this will continue as more people are vaccinated and restrictions are eased. Next week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell will delivery his semi-annual testimony on the economy and monetary policy. He\u2019s made it clear that no rate hikes are on the horizon and it is too soon to consider tapering asset purchases. At the same time, he\u2019s optimistic about the recovery, and expects stronger growth in the second half of the year. The combination of a positive outlook and policy accommodation is good for stocks, high-beta currencies and bad for the U.S. dollar. This week\u2019s moves could be a reflection of investors positioning for the Fed\u2019s optimism.Sterling was not the day\u2019s strongest performer (that title goes to the Australian and New Zealand dollars) but the move above 1.40 is significant. Retail sales\u00a0were terrible. Consumer spending dropped 8.2% in the month of January, three times more than expected. However, sterling bulls were unfazed by this release, choosing instead to focus on stronger PMIs. Manufacturing and service sector activity improved in February, which drove the composite rate up to 49.8 from 41.2. This is significantly stronger than the 42.2 forecast. The PMIs are more forward-looking than retail sales, but consumer spending needs to recover to keep pace with manufacturing activity otherwise manufacturing will have to slow.The return of Chinese investors drove the Australian and New Zealand dollars to fresh multi-year highs.\u00a0Both currencies rose more than 1% against the greenback intraday and the breakout after a period of consolidation in AUD/USD and NZD/USD could lead to further gains in the coming week. Australian and New Zealand data was actually disappointing, with very little producer price growth in New Zealand in the fourth quarter. In Australia, manufacturing activity slowed, while retail sales growth missed expectations. These reports would normally drive AUD/USD lower, but investors are laser focused on recovery. Virus cases are extremely low in both countries and New Zealand just lifted its three-day lockdown. The Canadian dollar also shrugged off weaker retail sales. Consumer spending dropped 3.4% at the end of last year, which was worse than the -2.5% forecast.The\u00a0euro trailed behind GBP, AUD and NZD but Eurozone's economic reports were the most encouraging.\u00a0The composite PMI index increased in the month of February thanks to stronger manufacturing activity in Germany and the Eurozone. Services continued to contract, but the strong expansion in manufacturing more than made up the difference. According to the producer price report, inflationary pressures in the Germany increased at the start of the year. With that said, the gains in EUR/USD were modest as the pair hovers underneath the 50-day SMA.\n"}, {"headline": "Euro Forecast: Why Bulls Like EUR/JPY More Than EUR/USD", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/hD.CP8K5AknbE3Yvtv_VBA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/2b1579959f6ef2083a7f7d9790ce37ea", "auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "The world of FX is based on relativity, and relatively speaking, the EU is trailing other developed economies with its vaccination rates, and the EU is growing less robustly than other regions. By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD rangebound between 1.2120-40s, but supported by soft US dollar", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/GKhWpBLqwFPGGomB8aJnKw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/8902a4f64027fa91c191bbbeab75007a", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "EUR/USD has bounced back from session lows of just below the 1.2120 mark in recent trade, saved weakness in the US dollar, but has been unable to get back to last week\u2019s highs around 1.2150 or indeed session highs set early in the European session in the 1.2140s. On the day, the pair trades with modest gains of about 20 pips or 0.15%.\n\nEUR/USD is seemingly back trading in last Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s 1.2120ish-1.2150ish range. It may take a more pronounced weakening of the US dollar (i.e. the Dollar Index dropping back towards 21 January lows of just above the 90.00 level) in order for the pair to break above 1.2150, given subdued appetite towards the euro at the moment. Above 1.2150, however, EUR/USD will find resistance in the form of the 50-day moving average at 1.2155.\n\nSafe havens assets (such as JPY, USD and US government bonds) are struggling on the first trading day of the week, despite the absence of Chinese and North American market participants, both of whom are celebrating respective public holidays (Presidents\u2019 Day in America and still midway through Lunar New Year celebrations in China). Global equity and crude oil markets have been rallying given optimism regarding the state of the global pandemic (the UK hit the crucial milestone of vaccinating it\u2019s 15M most vulnerable citizens and the US is seeing a continued drop in the infection rate whilst it ramps up its vaccination efforts).\n\nPositive pandemic news comes against the already favourable backdrop of expectations for more US fiscal stimulus, ongoing global central bank support and a rapid global economic expansion to begin later in the year as populations in key developed markets hit herd immunity. Hence, US equity index futures have been pushing on to fresh all-time high levels on Monday and US bond yields are also rising (the 10-year is now above 1.21%), though, importantly for USD, real yields remain low (the 10-year TIPS sits at -1.02%). For rising nominal yields to be bullish for the US dollar, they will have to be accompanied by rising real yields (which would make the USD a more attractive investment relative to other currencies).\n\nDespite broad weakness in the US dollar versus the majority of its G10 counterparts (aside from JPY, which is being hit even worse), EUR/USD has failed to garner much by way of upside impetus. Part of that will be due to the lack of market volume at the moment given the absence of US and Chinese players in the market on Monday (due to public holidays). But that does not explain euro underperformance against the likes of GBP, CAD, AUD and NZD.\n\nEuro underperformance versus risk-sensitive FX (like the Australian, Kiwi and Canadian dollars) makes sense given the market\u2019s risk-on tone. Euro weakness versus pound sterling seems to have more to do with the EU\u2019s comparatively sluggish vaccination efforts versus the UK; as noted, the UK hit its 15M vaccinations by mid-February target over the weekend. Nearly one-quarter of the citizens in the UK have now been vaccinated. That compares to just 5% in Germany, 4.9% in Italy, 4.4% in France and 5.3% in Spain. Meanwhile, the US has vaccinated 16% of its population and is not too far behind the UK.\n\nAs long as vaccinations do remain effective against the various Covid-19 variants spreading across the world at the moment, the US and UK are set to reopen their economies much sooner than the EU. For example, the UK is targeting getting the first jab in the arms of all of its adult populations by the end of May. By contrast the EU is expecting to have fully vaccinated only 70% of its adults by the end of September. The Eurozone\u2019s sluggish vaccination performance may well weigh on the euro further.\n\nMeanwhile, though infection rates have been dropping on the mainland, concerns linger regarding the spread of Covid-19 variants (such as that first found in the UK or South Africa); advisors to Italian Health Minister have reportedly been suggesting that the country should impose another nationwide lockdown amid concerns over the spread of new Covid-19 variants. Talk of tougher restrictions in the EU could highlight the bloc\u2019s divergent fortunes when compared to the US and UK, where the momentum is towards easing restrictions.\n\nIn terms of Eurozone news flow on Monday, data this morning was mixed; the bloc\u2019s trade surplus was a little larger than expected in December at EUR 29.2B versus forecasts for a reading of EUR 25.3B. However, Industrial Production data for the same month was a disappointment; the YoY rate of production growth came in at a sluggish -0.8% versus forecasts for -0.3% and the MoM rate of production growth showed a larger than expected monthly drop of 1.6% (versus forecasts for -1.0%).\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "Australian Dollar Technical Forecast: AUD/USD, AUD/JPY, EUR/AUD", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "James Stanley", "body": "It was a forceful show of strength for the Australian currency this week as AUD hit fresh yearly-highs against the major currencies of USD, JPY and the Euro. In a backdrop where loose for longer rules the day, the hues of optimism around Australia have helped to bring buyers to the bid, driving the currency so far for much of early-2021 trade and, bigger picture, since the pandemic lows were set last March. \n\nThe pair was already on its back foot coming into 2020 trade, reeling from a combination of weakness in the Australian economy along with a general hint of risk aversion that had helped to bring upon a stronger Japanese Yen. Of course, with looming trade wars in the background, \u2018risk on\u2019 sentiment was difficult to muster at the time, and as the coronavirus began to get priced-in to markets early last year, risk aversion reared its ugly head as AUD/JPY tested below the 60.00 level for the first time since the 2008 Financial Collapse. \n\nThat test was fleeting, however, as the psychological level helped to bring buyers back to the bid; and initially, this helped to slow the sell-off. \n\nTo learn more about how psychological levels can function as support/resistance, check out DailyFX Education\n\nAs the risk trade started to return with gusto in April and May, AUD/JPY moved along with it, reversing those prior losses and beginning to show signs of strength. And that theme largely continued through the 2021 open, at which point AUD/JPY began to find resistance around another psychological level at the 80.00 handle. \n\nThis led into back-and-forth price action in January and through the February open, and when I wrote up the Analyst Pick on this setup last week, that gyration had just begun to give way on short-term charts as the inverse head and shoulders pattern that had built on long-term charts began to give way.

And while there\u2019s been ample motive for the development of this trend, there could be pullback potential into next week, and on the four-hour chart below, I\u2019ve identified two possible areas of higher-low support that can keep the door open for bullish trend scenarios. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDJPY on Tradingview\n\nAUD/USD Drives Towards .8000 Big Fig\n\nA similar conundrum presents itself in AUD/USD where a red-hot bullish trend has moved into an overbought state, making for a challenging backdrop to those looking to continue that move. But, similarly, pullbacks could be a possible way of moving forward here, looking to institute trend trading logic after the fresh breakout; and below I look into three different areas of possible higher-low support in AUD/USD. The nearest runs from .7820-.7836, with the deeper zone showing around .7708-.7728. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUDUSD on Tradingview\n\nEUR/AUD Moves Towards Long-Term Trendline \n\nWhile the Euro hasn\u2019t been as generally weak as the US Dollar or the Japanese Yen since the pandemic began, more recently, the Euro has been seeing an increasing amount of pressure. But from this week the big takeaway was just how strong the Australian Dollar was and this reflects well in the EUR/AUD chart. \n\nFrom the monthly variety below, we can see where a long-term trendline has come into play this week as the pair has pushed down to fresh two-year-lows. If EUR/AUD does hold this line of support into next week, it could make for an interesting reversal play, particularly for those that are looking to fade this recent round of Aussie strength. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/AUD on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "DXY vs S&P's vs Gold", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zsN8_u4ssqAGXoQvoV4ofA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/76825f5773348b586328b2db07473959", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "To respectfully indulge words from the last post for context:\n\nOverall, EUR/USD was the first currency in August 2020 to break above its 5 year average at 1.1300\u2019s then the 10 year average in December 2020 at 1.2100\u2019s. EUR/USD is categorized in the class of a risk asset and non USD currency.\n\nEUR/USD\u2019s early break to its 5 year average set remainder 27 currencies on a course of deep perspective as non USD currency pairs had to not only match EUR/USD\u2019s break to significant averages but the 1000 pip rise in GBP/USD, 700 for AUD/USD and other non USD currency pairs traded weekly from overbought to overbought and a non normal price circumstance. EUR/USD\u2019s break threw normal price markets deeply off course since August 2020.\n\nNon USD currency pairs such as DXY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY only option since August 2020 was to concur with EUR/USD and non USD rises by trading deeply oversold week to week and to break 5 and 10 year averages.\n\nEUR/USD and non USD currency pairs as risk assets followed risk asset counterparts in stock markets higher to current richter scale overbought levels. The S&P's at 3900.00's trade at\u00a0 extreme overbought levels. The DAX achieved all time highs. Stock market longs are virtually impossible until a significant correction occurs.\n\nDXY\n\nDXY for example just broke above its 10 year monthly average at 89.95 and contains a long way to travel to the 5 year average at 95.00\u2019s. A currency pair to trade at a 10 year monthly average is not only a low, low price but extraordinary and highlights the magnitude to the\u00a0 rises and falls since last August.\n\nNext averages above to break are located at 91.43, 92.78 then 94.39 and 94.16. DXY from monthly averages 1 to 7 years faces stiff resistance from 94.00's to 95.00's. A break through this brick wall then DXY will travel easily to 97.00's and 99.00's.\n\nDXY below 89.95 targets 86.43, 84.32 and 81.83 at extreme oversold.\n\nTargets for DXY above 89.95 are located at 90.86, above 91.43 then 92.15,\u00a0 92.47 and 92.66. Above 92.78 targets 92.87 and 92.89.\n\nDXY from current ranges from 89.95 to 92.78 trade at its widest ranges. As DXY travels higher then ranges severely compress. The opposite is true for EUR/USD as the higher it trades then ranges open much wider.\n\nDespite a low price and trade below monthly 5 year averages, DXY is mid range to oversold/ overbought.\n\nS&P's\n\nDXY viewed from the S&P's informs trade location miles above the 5 year monthly average at 2722.43 and at overbought to extremes. Overbought S&P's reveals a healthy correction is on the way, DXY higher and EUR/USD as well as non USD currency pairs to follow much lower.\n\nThe S&P's are held by immediate averages at 3257.68, 3119.54 and 2989.17. A correction targets 3598.53, 3416.84 and 3300.20. A 400 point correction to the S&P's assumes DXY travels 300 ish pips higher and\u00a0 breaks above 92.78 to trade between 92.78 to 94.39.\n\nS&P averages from 3257.68 travels every 100 points to 2200.00's at the 10 year monthly average. Current S&P's ranges are fairly suppressed however as S&P's drop then ranges expand as the downside gains progresses.\n\nGold\n\nGold trades above its 5 year monthly average at 1461.20 and trades misaligned to the S&P's. Gold and the DXY are the same assets and should trade below 5 year monthly averages while the S&P's trade above.\n\nGold's drop is held by 1815.65 and below targets 1642.17 and 1543.98. Gold is deeply overbought from a medium and long term perspective. Gold is finished above at 1943.62 and short is the only trade available.\u00a0\n\nMoving forward, long USD and DXY is the best option while short Gold and the S&P's although Gold lacks any real range capability.

However, the weakening of the Swiss franc and the strengthening of the Aussie point otherwise. Thus, in order to get a clearer picture with regards to the broader market sentiment, we prefer to turn our gaze to the equity world.\n\nThere, major EU indices were a sea of red, while in the US, Nasdaq fell 0.58%. The S&P 500 finished virtually unchanged, while the Dow Jones gained 0.29%. In Asia, sentiment was soft again, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and South Korea\u2019s KOSPI falling 0.19%, 1.70% and 1.50% respectively.\n\nThe exception was China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, which gained 0.55% on its first trading day after the Lunar New Year celebrations.Major global stock indices performanceEquities continued to pull back, perhaps as rising inflation expectations continued to push bond yields higher, with the benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield hitting its highest in a year yesterday. This means that the reflation trade could prove to be positive for equities but only to the point where the rise in bond yields is considered too fast, which could raise speculation over monetary-policy tapering by major central banks.\n\nHowever, we believe that it is too early for something like that and the minutes from the latest FOMC meeting add credence to our view.\u00a0Yes, officials noted that PCE prices \u2013 their favorite inflation metric \u2013 were projected to move briefly above 2% in the second quarter of 2021, but this would prove to be temporary and eventually inflation is expected to finish the year at just below 2%.\n\nInflation was projected to moderate overshoot 2% for some time in the years beyond 2023, but with monetary policy assumed to remain accommodative.\u00a0Thus, with no signs of tapering any time soon, we believe that equities have the potential to rebound again, and safe havens to come under renewed selling interest.\n\nToday, the item on the agenda which could attract some special attention may be the minutes from the latest ECB policy gathering. Despite the lockdown measures around the Eurozone, at the press conference following that decision, President Lagarde said that the downside risks to the economic outlook are now \u201cless pronounced\u201d, making investors skeptical over further easing,\u00a0although the Bank repeated once again that it stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate.\u00a0Therefore, we will scan the minutes to see whether Lagarde\u2019s view is shared among other officials as well, and whether indeed the chances for more easing have lessened for now. Something like that may benefit somewhat the euro.\n\nAfter finding resistance near the 30717 barrier on Tuesday, Nikkei 225 started correcting lower. That said, the downmove might get halted, if the short-term tentative upside line, drawn from the low of Jan. 31, continues to provide support. For now, we will take a cautiously-bullish approach.\n\nAs mentioned above, if the aforementioned upside line remains intact, the bulls may take advantage of the lower price and lift it up again. That\u2019 when we will target yesterday\u2019s high, at 30585, or the 30717 barrier, marked by the current highest point of this week. Initially, Nikkei 225 might stall there for a bit, or even correct back down again. However, if the index stays above the previously-mentioned upside line, another push higher could be possible. If this time the bulls are able to overcome the 30717 hurdle, the next possible target could be at 31371, marked by the highest point of August 1990.\n\nOn the other hand, if the aforementioned upside line breaks and the index also falls below the 29660 zone, marked by the high of Feb. 12, that may open the door for further declines. Nikkei 225 may then slide to the low of Feb. 10, at 29177, a break of which could set the stage for a move to the 28720 level. That level is marked near the high of Feb. 3 and by an intraday swing low of Feb. 5.Japan's Nikkei 225 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nEUR/JPY drifted to the downside yesterday, after finding resistance near the 128.45 barrier. The pair is in slight consolidation this morning; however, it may continue its journey south for a bit more. That said, as long as the rate remains above a short-term upside support line, drawn from the low of Jan. 18, this move lower might be seen as a temporary correction only.\n\nIf the rate drifts below the 127.31 zone, marked by yesterday\u2019s low, that could send the pair towards its next potential support area, near the 126.98 hurdle, marked by the low of Feb. 12. Around there, the pair may also find support from the aforementioned upside line. EUR/JPY might get picked up by the bulls there, and if so, it could travel back up to the 127.31 obstacle, or even the 127.68 hurdle, marked by an intraday swing low of Feb. 15. If the buying doesn\u2019t stop there, the next potential target might be at 127.97, or at 128.45, which is the current highest point of February.Alternatively, if the previously-mentioned upside line breaks and the pair falls below the 126.70 hurdle, marked by the low of Feb. 11, that could also place the rate below the 200 EMA on our 4-hour chart. This may be seen as a bearish indication and more sellers could join in. EUR/JPY might then drift to the 126.43 obstacle, a break of which may clear the path to the 126.10 level. That level is marked by the current lowest point of February.EUR/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nThe US building permits and housing starts for\u00a0January are\u00a0coming out, and they are both expected to have declined somewhat from their December readings.\u00a0We also get the initial jobless claims for last week, with the forecast pointing to a small decline, to 765k from 793k the week before.\n\nWith regards to the energy market, we get the EIA (Energy Information Administration) report on crude oil inventories for last week, with the forecast pointing to a 2.429mn barrels decline following a 6.644mn fall the week before.\u00a0Yesterday, the API reported a 5.800mn barrels slide and thus, we would consider the risks surrounding the EIA forecast as tilted to the downside.

The dollar index rose by 20 points to 90.50, smack in the middle of its recent days\u2019 trading range.\n\nThe euro fell slightly to 1.2105, edging lower again to 1.2090 this morning. The UK Pound has also declined to 1.3895 today. Both, however, remained comfortably above support, notably Sterling. Japanese yen was the big G7 mover, climbing 0.63% to 106.05 before retreating to 105.85 this morning. The rise in USD/JPY highlights its sensitivity to US/Japan rate differentials. USD/JPY is comfortably above its falling wedge and the 200-DMA, both at 105.55. Assuming US yields stay where they are, USD/JPY should target 107.00 in the coming sessions.\n\nThe commodity-centric Australian and New Zealand dollars both fell overnight, having been primary recipients of the global recovery rotations, along with the Canadian dollar, last week. Despite this, USD/CAD remains well below resistance at 1.2760, at 1.2700 today. Similarly, AUD/USD is trading at 0.7750, well clear of support at 0.7690. NZD/USD has fallen to 0.7200 this morning and is threatening to fall back through its symmetrical triangle at this level. It could potentially target 0.7100 initially, with the return of community Covid-19 cases in Auckland finally weighing on the Kiwi. An increase in New Zealand cases could herald the start of a deeper correction for the flightless bird.\n\nWith China on holiday until tomorrow, Asian currencies have given ground modestly overnight and this morning, although the price action looks corrective again. Indonesian Rupiah has climbed back above 14,000.00, and if US yields rise again this week, a weaker IDR could take a Friday rate cut by Bank Indonesia off the table. For the rest of the currency universe, tonight\u2019s US data, and its effect on US yields, will determine how far the US dollar correction will run.\n\nOriginal Post\n"}, {"headline": "Greenback extends gains amidst upbeat economic data", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/xZYeFPFMAgWDJbZdwTRLfA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/b66a9c9d6efc52b79060c12e7cdc175c", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Note: Charts provided by Trading View\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonthly timeframe:\n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves)\n\nFebruary, as you can see, remains off session lows, though currently trades 0.8 percent lower.\n\nDownstream, 1.1857/1.1352 represents demand, while northbound shines light on ascending resistance (prior support \u2013 1.1641).\n\nIn terms of trend, the primary uptrend has been in play since price broke the 1.1714 high (Aug 2015) in July 2017.\n\nDaily timeframe:\n\nAnother spirited USD advance (DXY > 91.00) weighed on Europe\u2019s shared currency Wednesday, consequently shifting the technical spotlight towards demand from 1.1923/1.2001\u2014an area housing support at 1.1965 (previous Quasimodo resistance).\n\nRSI action dipped back under the 50.00 centreline, after shaking hands with two converging RSI trendline resistances (yellow box).\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nEUR/USD extending losses on Wednesday led price movement through support drawn from 1.2087 and 1.2057. Run-of-the-mill demand resides around the 1.2035 region (red arrow), though bearish bets may take aim at trendline resistance-turned support, extended from the high 1.2349.\n\nH1 timeframe:\n\nQuasimodo support at 1.2023 made an entrance heading into US hours Wednesday, a level accompanied by a 127.2% Fib extension at 1.2029. Further upside off this base will likely make its way towards supply coming in at 1.2078/1.2062, though pushing southbound will bring light to the widely watched 1.20 level, joined by 78.6% Fib level at 1.1998.\n\nRSI recently rebounded off support from 20.64 and exited oversold space.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nMonthly price is on course to perhaps retest 1.1857/1.1352 demand, while daily flow is on the doorstep of demand from 1.1923/1.2001.\n\nShorter-term flow reveals H4 nudged under support at 1.2057, therefore a bearish theme could emerge until we shake hands with nearby trendline support.\n\nAlthough H1 is balancing off Quasimodo support at 1.2023, a dip to 1.20 bids is perhaps on the table. This is a level not only linked with a 78.6% Fib level at 1.1998, but also the upper side of daily demand taken from 1.2001.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonthly timeframe:\n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves)\n\nJanuary\u2019s half-hearted shooting star candle (often construed as a bearish indication at peaks) has so far failed to seduce sellers. February, as you can see, trades a touch off session highs, up by about 1.5 percent.\n\nThis brings light to 0.8303/0.8082\u2014a supply zone aligning closely with trendline resistance (prior support - 0.4776). In the event sellers regain consciousness, however, long-term demand resides at 0.7029/0.6664 (prior supply).\n\nIn the context of trend (despite the trendline resistance [1.0582] breach in July 2020), the primary downtrend (since mid-2011) remains in play until breaking 0.8135 (January high [2018]).\n\nDaily timeframe:\n\nPartly modified from previous analysis \u2013\n\nAUD/USD concluded Wednesday pretty much unmoved and established an indecision doji candle.\n\nUpriver, beyond 2021 pinnacles at 0.7820, supply inhabits the 0.7937/0.7890 neighbourhood. Calling for attention to the downside, on the other hand, is trendline support, an ascending level drawn from the low 0.5506.\n\nRSI flow is seen touching gloves with RSI trendline resistance. A downside move here has the 50.00 centreline in sight, while moves north could have the value invade overbought space.\n\nH4 timeframe: \n\nResistance at 0.7769 remains in play. Though traders are encouraged to note the drop-base-rally demand zone at around the 0.7727ish region (green) is also attracting a modest bullish defence.\n\nAs evident from the chart, support at 0.7698, a previous Quasimodo resistance, is next in line should sellers take on more of a dominant position today.\n\nH1 timeframe: \n\nThe 100-period simple moving average around 0.7761 served well as dynamic resistance on Wednesday, directing the H1 candles south of 0.7750.\n\nQuasimodo support is seen at 0.7719, with a break uncovering the 0.77 figure. Bullish impetus, movement that takes the currency pair north of the 100-period simple moving average, could lead things back to resistance at 0.7777, followed by 0.78.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nPartly modified from previous analysis \u2013\n\nRetesting 0.7750 resistance could spark a short-term bearish scenario towards 0.77 on the H1 (H1 Quasimodo support is potentially fragile having seen the level tested last Friday).\u00a0\n\nLonger term, the monthly chart shows buyers are likely to eventually take the wheel, though prior to this, daily action could retreat and retest trendline support, perhaps inspiring a wave of dip-buying.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonthly timeframe: \n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves) \n\nBuyers are beginning to show life on the monthly scale, following January\u2019s bullish engulfing candle.\n\nUp by 1.2 percent, resistance can be seen in the form of a descending line (not considered traditional trendline resistance), etched from the high 118.66, whereas support continues to inhabit 101.70 in the event sellers make a show.\n\nDaily timeframe: \n\nWednesday witnessed sellers step forward within the walls of supply from 106.33/105.78, following Tuesday\u2019s dynamic push above the 200-day simple moving average at 105.52. Snapping a five-day winning streak, yesterday\u2019s action could spark a retest at the aforementioned SMA.\n\nThe RSI indicator exited overbought waters and produced bearish divergence. Support remains on the table around 57.00.\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nThe October 7 (2020) peak at 106.11 made a show on Wednesday and, as you can see, stimulated a bearish response.\n\nDemand in sight can be seen at 105.26/105.41 and 105.26/105.14 (commonly referred to as stacked demand), while should buyers overthrow 106.11, a 127.2% Fib projection at 106.44 is in view, shadowed by Quasimodo resistance at 106.58.\n\nH1 timeframe:\n\nPartly modified from previous analysis \u2013\n\n106 proved a fragile level yesterday, yet support drawn from 105.80 (previous Quasimodo resistance). South of here, we also have two trendline supports to be mindful of, extended from the low 104.55 and 104.41, along with a 100-period simple moving average. \n\nThe RSI indicator, as you might expect, in view of the upside movement since last week, continues to explore overbought territory. Notice that support also formed around the 44.00ish range, a common scenario in a rising market.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nThe reaction from daily supply at 106.33/105.78 might tempt sellers to extend the unit lower and retest the 200-day simple moving average around 105.52. Given the monthly timeframe\u2019s bullish position right now (see above), a dip to the SMA could spark a bullish theme. Note the SMA also coincides closely with H4 demand at 105.26/105.41.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonthly timeframe: \n\n(Technical change on this timeframe is often limited though serves as guidance to potential longer-term moves) \n\nFollowing December\u2019s 2.5 percent advance\u2014movement that stirred major trendline resistance (2.1161)\u2014February has refreshed multi-month highs at 1.3951.\n\nIn terms of trend structure, however, the primary trend has faced lower since early 2008, unbroken (as of current price) until 1.4376 gives way\u2014April high, 2018. In effect, the aforesaid high represents the next upside objective on the monthly chart.\n\nDaily timeframe: \n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s indecision candle connected with supply at 1.3996/1.3918 and refreshed 2021 highs, Wednesday saw sellers step forward and shine light on support from 1.3755.\n\nRSI action recently broke above the upper edge of a 3-month range between support around 47.00 and resistance at the 66.00 region (the value stands at 67.67), though recently retreated back into the consolidation after coming within touching distance of overbought levels.\n\nH4 timeframe:\n\nBrought forward from previous analysis \u2013\n\nEarly hours Tuesday witnessed price movement puncture the upper side of supply from 1.3942/1.3900 (glued to the lower side of daily supply at 1.3996/1.3918). With many price action traders likely to view this as a bullish cue (sellers consumed at supply), dip-buying could emerge off support from 1.3852.\n\nIt should also be noted that a dip below 1.3852 could send price back to demand at 1.3761/1.3789.\n\nH1 timeframe: \n\nAs can be seen from the H1 chart this morning, recent flow dived under the 100-period simple moving average and crossed swords with 1.3850 support. Below, 1.38 is on the radar, stationed just north of Quasimodo support from 1.3787. Above the 100-period simple moving average, on the other hand, we can see the 1.39 big figure resistance.\n\nRSI movement bottomed ahead of oversold levels on Wednesday and is within touching distance of the lower side of 50.00.\n\nObserved levels:\n\nIn similar fashion to Wednesday\u2019s writing, the monthly timeframe eyeing 1.4376, in addition to H4 price testing support at 1.3852 and H1 1.3850 support, this could have buyers take the spotlight and attempt to bring things over the 100-period simple moving average on the H1 today.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "British Pound (GBP) Latest: GBP/USD to Head Lower, EUR/GBP Lower Too", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "", "body": "The market narrative earlier this week \u2013 that Covid-19 vaccinations will prompt the global economy to recover strongly from the slump caused by the pandemic, bringing rising inflation with it \u2013 will likely re-emerge once the current round of profit-taking has run its course.\n\nHopes of a powerful economic bounce as lockdowns end, especially in the US, have led to a sharp rise in yields on US Treasury bonds and notes in response to those inflation fears, and investors in bonds will likely resume their selling, instead buying value stocks and also commodities like oil and copper that would benefit from an upturn.\n\nThat rise in yields will also likely continue to benefit the US Dollar even though fears that US monetary policy will be tightened soon, and that the expected package of stimulus measures will be cut back or delayed, seem wide of the mark for now.

The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "US Dollar Price Action Setups: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, USD/JPY", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/7my6vELlhsolWkp4HPp58g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/063085c9015523ec17ebca884f284d8c", "auther": "James Stanley", "body": "It was a wash week in the US Dollar as the currency is looking to finish the week very close to where it had started. It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD: Long, weekly and daily forecasts", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/0wHdbLg6oQ5GYQjQTZyavw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/6ac74574aa0002667e14055fc15983d6", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "In relation to January 3rd long term forecasts and MA inflection points and targets posted once every 3 or 5 months and to 5, 10 and 14 year averages, overall currency market prices stand at critical junctures to travel higher or to embark on a deep correction.\n\nWhen the ECB adopted negative interest rates in June 2014, the EUR/USD was located at\u00a0 highs of 1.3694 then\u00a0 traded to 1.0346 lows or 3348 pips by June 2017 on a continuation of deeper negative rates.

On the day, the pair trades with modest gains of about 20 pips or 0.15%.\n\nEUR/USD is seemingly back trading in last Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s 1.2120ish-1.2150ish range. It may take a more pronounced weakening of the US dollar (i.e. the Dollar Index dropping back towards 21 January lows of just above the 90.00 level) in order for the pair to break above 1.2150, given subdued appetite towards the euro at the moment. Above 1.2150, however, EUR/USD will find resistance in the form of the 50-day moving average at 1.2155.\n\nSafe havens assets (such as JPY, USD and US government bonds) are struggling on the first trading day of the week, despite the absence of Chinese and North American market participants, both of whom are celebrating respective public holidays (Presidents\u2019 Day in America and still midway through Lunar New Year celebrations in China). Global equity and crude oil markets have been rallying given optimism regarding the state of the global pandemic (the UK hit the crucial milestone of vaccinating it\u2019s 15M most vulnerable citizens and the US is seeing a continued drop in the infection rate whilst it ramps up its vaccination efforts).\n\nPositive pandemic news comes against the already favourable backdrop of expectations for more US fiscal stimulus, ongoing global central bank support and a rapid global economic expansion to begin later in the year as populations in key developed markets hit herd immunity. Hence, US equity index futures have been pushing on to fresh all-time high levels on Monday and US bond yields are also rising (the 10-year is now above 1.21%), though, importantly for USD, real yields remain low (the 10-year TIPS sits at -1.02%). For rising nominal yields to be bullish for the US dollar, they will have to be accompanied by rising real yields (which would make the USD a more attractive investment relative to other currencies).\n\nDespite broad weakness in the US dollar versus the majority of its G10 counterparts (aside from JPY, which is being hit even worse), EUR/USD has failed to garner much by way of upside impetus. Part of that will be due to the lack of market volume at the moment given the absence of US and Chinese players in the market on Monday (due to public holidays). But that does not explain euro underperformance against the likes of GBP, CAD, AUD and NZD.\n\nEuro underperformance versus risk-sensitive FX (like the Australian, Kiwi and Canadian dollars) makes sense given the market\u2019s risk-on tone. Euro weakness versus pound sterling seems to have more to do with the EU\u2019s comparatively sluggish vaccination efforts versus the UK; as noted, the UK hit its 15M vaccinations by mid-February target over the weekend. Nearly one-quarter of the citizens in the UK have now been vaccinated. That compares to just 5% in Germany, 4.9% in Italy, 4.4% in France and 5.3% in Spain. Meanwhile, the US has vaccinated 16% of its population and is not too far behind the UK.\n\nAs long as vaccinations do remain effective against the various Covid-19 variants spreading across the world at the moment, the US and UK are set to reopen their economies much sooner than the EU. For example, the UK is targeting getting the first jab in the arms of all of its adult populations by the end of May. By contrast the EU is expecting to have fully vaccinated only 70% of its adults by the end of September. The Eurozone\u2019s sluggish vaccination performance may well weigh on the euro further.\n\nMeanwhile, though infection rates have been dropping on the mainland, concerns linger regarding the spread of Covid-19 variants (such as that first found in the UK or South Africa); advisors to Italian Health Minister have reportedly been suggesting that the country should impose another nationwide lockdown amid concerns over the spread of new Covid-19 variants. Talk of tougher restrictions in the EU could highlight the bloc\u2019s divergent fortunes when compared to the US and UK, where the momentum is towards easing restrictions.\n\nIn terms of Eurozone news flow on Monday, data this morning was mixed; the bloc\u2019s trade surplus was a little larger than expected in December at EUR 29.2B versus forecasts for a reading of EUR 25.3B. However, Industrial Production data for the same month was a disappointment; the YoY rate of production growth came in at a sluggish -0.8% versus forecasts for -0.3% and the MoM rate of production growth showed a larger than expected monthly drop of 1.6% (versus forecasts for -1.0%).\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "PICK UP ONLY - Texas Rangers Primary Logo Sign Displayed at Entrance of Clubhouse Tunnel Leading to...", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Major League Baseball", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/xaUc6jnIof9Qu1S2NYuUjQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/cdef51d9bcc498c7c8afc9c3a9de58d6", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "DXY vs S&P's vs Gold", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zsN8_u4ssqAGXoQvoV4ofA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/76825f5773348b586328b2db07473959", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "To respectfully indulge words from the last post for context:\n\nOverall, EUR/USD was the first currency in August 2020 to break above its 5 year average at 1.1300\u2019s then the 10 year average in December 2020 at 1.2100\u2019s.

EUR/USD\u2019s break threw normal price markets deeply off course since August 2020.\n\nNon USD currency pairs such as DXY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY only option since August 2020 was to concur with EUR/USD and non USD rises by trading deeply oversold week to week and to break 5 and 10 year averages.\n\nEUR/USD and non USD currency pairs as risk assets followed risk asset counterparts in stock markets higher to current richter scale overbought levels.

Current S&P's ranges are fairly suppressed however as S&P's drop then ranges expand as the downside gains progresses.\n\nGold\n\nGold trades above its 5 year monthly average at 1461.20 and trades misaligned to the S&P's. Gold and the DXY are the same assets and should trade below 5 year monthly averages while the S&P's trade above.\n\nGold's drop is held by 1815.65 and below targets 1642.17 and 1543.98. Gold is deeply overbought from a medium and long term perspective. Gold is finished above at 1943.62 and short is the only trade available.\u00a0\n\nMoving forward, long USD and DXY is the best option while short Gold and the S&P's although Gold lacks any real range capability. Gold viewed from 150 to 200 points is a viable option as it fails to contain any big price moves.\n"}, {"headline": "British Pound (GBP) Latest: GBP/USD to Head Lower, EUR/GBP Lower Too", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "", "body": "The market narrative earlier this week \u2013 that Covid-19 vaccinations will prompt the global economy to recover strongly from the slump caused by the pandemic, bringing rising inflation with it \u2013 will likely re-emerge once the current round of profit-taking has run its course.\n\nHopes of a powerful economic bounce as lockdowns end, especially in the US, have led to a sharp rise in yields on US Treasury bonds and notes in response to those inflation fears, and investors in bonds will likely resume their selling, instead buying value stocks and also commodities like oil and copper that would benefit from an upturn.\n\nThat rise in yields will also likely continue to benefit the US Dollar even though fears that US monetary policy will be tightened soon, and that the expected package of stimulus measures will be cut back or delayed, seem wide of the mark for now.

Again, the price action looks corrective rather than a structural change in trend. The dollar index rose by 20 points to 90.50, smack in the middle of its recent days\u2019 trading range.\n\nThe euro fell slightly to 1.2105, edging lower again to 1.2090 this morning. The UK Pound has also declined to 1.3895 today. Both, however, remained comfortably above support, notably Sterling. Japanese yen was the big G7 mover, climbing 0.63% to 106.05 before retreating to 105.85 this morning. The rise in USD/JPY highlights its sensitivity to US/Japan rate differentials. USD/JPY is comfortably above its falling wedge and the 200-DMA, both at 105.55. Assuming US yields stay where they are, USD/JPY should target 107.00 in the coming sessions.\n\nThe commodity-centric Australian and New Zealand dollars both fell overnight, having been primary recipients of the global recovery rotations, along with the Canadian dollar, last week. Despite this, USD/CAD remains well below resistance at 1.2760, at 1.2700 today. Similarly, AUD/USD is trading at 0.7750, well clear of support at 0.7690. NZD/USD has fallen to 0.7200 this morning and is threatening to fall back through its symmetrical triangle at this level. It could potentially target 0.7100 initially, with the return of community Covid-19 cases in Auckland finally weighing on the Kiwi. An increase in New Zealand cases could herald the start of a deeper correction for the flightless bird.\n\nWith China on holiday until tomorrow, Asian currencies have given ground modestly overnight and this morning, although the price action looks corrective again. Indonesian Rupiah has climbed back above 14,000.00, and if US yields rise again this week, a weaker IDR could take a Friday rate cut by Bank Indonesia off the table. For the rest of the currency universe, tonight\u2019s US data, and its effect on US yields, will determine how far the US dollar correction will run.\n\nOriginal Post\n"}, {"headline": "Reflation dynamics continue dominating trading", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/XiuNWQLsVNBeOrowU3OR5A--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/b5128f885336d0374679bbdd0032aad1", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "Friday\u2019s price action saw a repeat yesterday with reflation dynamics pulling the strings in absence of US investors (Presidents\u2019 Day). Bear steepening of yield curves is currently the proponent of that trade. German yields added 1.3 bps to 4.6 bps (10-yr). The German 10-yr yield tested the August top at -0.38%. The 30-yr yield waved goodbye to similar resistance (0.1%) and trades at the highest level since June. UK Gilts underperformed German Bunds with UK yield adding up to 6.7 bps. Markets respond to the UK\u2019s competitive advantage gained through a different vaccination strategy with UK PM Johnson readying a roadmap out of the current lockdown. Earliest dates to free pockets of society/the economy from restricting measures would be announced in the near term. Johnson didn\u2019t want people to become overly optimistic by not guaranteeing the ability to take holidays over Easter (Apr 4). Sterling was the best amongst FX majors with EUR/GBP near the 0.87 big figure and drifting towards 0.8671 support. GBP/USD set a recovery high north of 1.39. UK stock markets (FTSE +2.5%) outperformed continental Europe (>1%). A strong weighting for financials (steeper curve) and commodity-related stocks added to positive UK news flow. Nearly every corner of the commodity markets remains in rallying mode. The arctic blaze over the US Mid-West contributed to higher oil and especially gas prices, both through constraint supply and increased demand. Several soft commodities and metals trade at multiyear highs. Commodity-related currencies shine. EUR/NOK fell below 10.20 yesterday for the first time since March. USD/CAD is near the year-to-date low of 1.26, matching the strongest CAD-level since 2018. AUD/USD performs a similar trick at 0.78.\n\nThe (stock market) party continues in Asia this morning with Japan winning up to 1%. Commodity markets are losing some vigor with the Bund and US Note future off yesterday\u2019s weakest intraday levels. The dollar managed to hold up well yesterday, but underperforms somewhat this morning. From a technical point of view, EUR/USD has difficulties to take out minor intermediate 1.2151 resistance (50% retracement of 2021 decline) with the trade weighted dollar remaining above more important support at 90.13 (62% retracement of that same move). Today\u2019s eco calendar remains poorly filled apart from German ZEW investor sentiment (February) and the US Empire Manufacturing survey (February). Reflation dynamics continue dominating trading, but this morning\u2019s price action suggest slowing momentum compared to Friday and Monday.\n\nThe share of companies rated triple C or below in total junk-bond sales has grown to the highest since 2007 in yet another sign investors are hunting down the rating ladder for yield. FT calculations show that about 15% of junk-bond deals took place in the most riskiest part of the debt market, based on S&P ratings. That figure rises to 21% according to Moody\u2019s bond reviewing. The investor stampede on those bonds has pushed its yield to record lows in recent weeks.\n\nThe European Commission will issue guidance to governments in the spring on when it thinks the budget rules should be observed again. The Stability and Growth Pact rules that limit borrowing to ensure public finance health, were lifted last year to help weather the pandemic. European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Gentiloni told any withdrawal of the support measures in any case would have to be carefully managed to avoid a sharp rise in bankruptcies.\n\nBoJ Governor Kuroda said the recent stock market rally reflects market optimism about the economy going forward and the vaccine rollouts. He added that it was premature to debate an exit from the easy policy that includes ETF purchases. His comments came after growing unease with some lawmakers that the very loose monetary policy is fueling asset price bubbles, especially at a time when Japanese stock indices are setting multidecade highs.\n\nDownload The Full Sunrise Market Commentary\n"}]}, {"id": "EUR/CHF", "price_data": [1.0818500518798828, 1.0816999673843384, 1.0817500352859497, 1.081719994544983, 1.0820000171661377,

"auther": "y Fawad Razaqzada", "body": "This article was written exclusively for Investing.com\n\nToday\u2019s EU and UK manufacturing PMIs surprised to the upside and both the pound and euro rallied, with the cable hitting that $1.40 hurdle I have been forecasting for a while and GBP/CHF climbing to my 1.25 long-term target.\n\nMy focus is now turning to the euro, which could be about to break out soon and potentially head towards the 1.25 area next.\n\nWith the GBP/USD making its move first, the EUR/USD is now highly likely, in my opinion, to follow suit in climbing towards its own corresponding milestone of 1.25 handle next. That\u2019s because these currency pairs have a strong positive correlation with one another, as you can see below:\n\n3 months\n\n6 months\n\n1 year\n\nEUR/USD vs. GBP/USD\n\n+0.90\n\n+0.90\n\n+0.80\n\nBeyond this simple correlation matrix, there are obviously several other reasons, including both macro and technical considerations, why I am bullish on the single currency.\n\nFrom a macro point of view, the following are among some of the reasons, I hold a positive view towards the EUR/USD:\n\nMore to the point, it is the charts and price action\u2014reflecting the market\u2019s collective thoughts and actions\u2014that makes me uber-bullish on the EUR/USD.\n\nThe daily chart of the EUR/USD shows a clear bullish trend with rising moving averages and the price continuing to consolidate inside a bull flag pattern after holding its own above the key 1.20 support level:\n\nEUR/USD Daily\n\nWhat I would like to see next from a bullish point of view is a break above the shaded resistance range between 1.2150 and 1.2200. A clean break above this zone should offer decent buying opportunity on the rounded retest to potentially take us to new highs on the year.\n\nThe monthly chart is looking quite strong, too, with the long-term bear trend already having broken down in 2020 and with rates climbing and now holding above that 1.20 handle:\n\nEUR/USD Monthly\n\nThe fact that the EUR/USD has now moved back above the January 2021 low means that the sellers who were looking for a breakdown below 1.20 may have already been trapped. If the bears are indeed trapped, which I think is the case, then a quick rally above the January range, at 1.2350, is likely, where a cluster of sellers\u2019 stop orders will surely be resting\u2014thus providing a pool of liquidity for the market to reach for. This makes it likely we will see an accelerated move higher towards 1.25s in the coming weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, the EUR/USD on this long-term time frame also seems to be following the path of the 2017-18 rally when rates surged higher earlier in the year before spending a few months in consolidation ahead of more gains in early parts of 2018. Since March last year, the EUR/USD has again rallied in a very similar fashion, consolidated for a while below the 1.20 handle and then broke out again. If this is anything to go by then a rally towards, and potentially beyond, 1.25 could be on the cards next.\n\nSo, the EUR/USD charts look quite bullish. As such, I would be more inclined to look for buying than selling opportunities as things stand and in any case until the charts suggest otherwise.\n"}, {"headline": "Euro Forecast: Why Bulls Like EUR/JPY More Than EUR/USD", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/hD.CP8K5AknbE3Yvtv_VBA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/2b1579959f6ef2083a7f7d9790ce37ea", "auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "The world of FX is based on relativity, and relatively speaking, the EU is trailing other developed economies with its vaccination rates, and the EU is growing less robustly than other regions. By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "Rising Yields Pressure Equities, ECB Minutes On The Agenda | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y JFD Team", "body": "Equities continued to pull back yesterday and today in Asia, perhaps as rising inflation expectations continued to push bond yields higher.

It gained the most versus CHF, EUR, and NOK in that order, while it was found virtually unchanged against AUD and JPY.USD performance G10 currenciesThe strengthening of the US dollar and the Japanese yen suggest that markets continued trading in a risk-off manner yesterday and today in Asia. However, the weakening of the Swiss franc and the strengthening of the Aussie point otherwise. Thus, in order to get a clearer picture with regards to the broader market sentiment, we prefer to turn our gaze to the equity world.\n\nThere, major EU indices were a sea of red, while in the US, Nasdaq fell 0.58%. The S&P 500 finished virtually unchanged, while the Dow Jones gained 0.29%. In Asia, sentiment was soft again, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and South Korea\u2019s KOSPI falling 0.19%, 1.70% and 1.50% respectively.\n\nThe exception was China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, which gained 0.55% on its first trading day after the Lunar New Year celebrations.Major global stock indices performanceEquities continued to pull back, perhaps as rising inflation expectations continued to push bond yields higher, with the benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield hitting its highest in a year yesterday. This means that the reflation trade could prove to be positive for equities but only to the point where the rise in bond yields is considered too fast, which could raise speculation over monetary-policy tapering by major central banks.\n\nHowever, we believe that it is too early for something like that and the minutes from the latest FOMC meeting add credence to our view.\u00a0Yes, officials noted that PCE prices \u2013 their favorite inflation metric \u2013 were projected to move briefly above 2% in the second quarter of 2021, but this would prove to be temporary and eventually inflation is expected to finish the year at just below 2%.\n\nInflation was projected to moderate overshoot 2% for some time in the years beyond 2023, but with monetary policy assumed to remain accommodative.\u00a0Thus, with no signs of tapering any time soon, we believe that equities have the potential to rebound again, and safe havens to come under renewed selling interest.\n\nToday, the item on the agenda which could attract some special attention may be the minutes from the latest ECB policy gathering. Despite the lockdown measures around the Eurozone, at the press conference following that decision, President Lagarde said that the downside risks to the economic outlook are now \u201cless pronounced\u201d, making investors skeptical over further easing,\u00a0although the Bank repeated once again that it stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate.\u00a0Therefore, we will scan the minutes to see whether Lagarde\u2019s view is shared among other officials as well, and whether indeed the chances for more easing have lessened for now. Something like that may benefit somewhat the euro.\n\nAfter finding resistance near the 30717 barrier on Tuesday, Nikkei 225 started correcting lower. That said, the downmove might get halted, if the short-term tentative upside line, drawn from the low of Jan. 31, continues to provide support. For now, we will take a cautiously-bullish approach.\n\nAs mentioned above, if the aforementioned upside line remains intact, the bulls may take advantage of the lower price and lift it up again. That\u2019 when we will target yesterday\u2019s high, at 30585, or the 30717 barrier, marked by the current highest point of this week. Initially, Nikkei 225 might stall there for a bit, or even correct back down again. However, if the index stays above the previously-mentioned upside line, another push higher could be possible. If this time the bulls are able to overcome the 30717 hurdle, the next possible target could be at 31371, marked by the highest point of August 1990.\n\nOn the other hand, if the aforementioned upside line breaks and the index also falls below the 29660 zone, marked by the high of Feb. 12, that may open the door for further declines. Nikkei 225 may then slide to the low of Feb. 10, at 29177, a break of which could set the stage for a move to the 28720 level. That level is marked near the high of Feb. 3 and by an intraday swing low of Feb. 5.Japan's Nikkei 225 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nEUR/JPY drifted to the downside yesterday, after finding resistance near the 128.45 barrier. The pair is in slight consolidation this morning; however, it may continue its journey south for a bit more. That said, as long as the rate remains above a short-term upside support line, drawn from the low of Jan. 18, this move lower might be seen as a temporary correction only.\n\nIf the rate drifts below the 127.31 zone, marked by yesterday\u2019s low, that could send the pair towards its next potential support area, near the 126.98 hurdle, marked by the low of Feb. 12. Around there, the pair may also find support from the aforementioned upside line. EUR/JPY might get picked up by the bulls there, and if so, it could travel back up to the 127.31 obstacle, or even the 127.68 hurdle, marked by an intraday swing low of Feb. 15. If the buying doesn\u2019t stop there, the next potential target might be at 127.97, or at 128.45, which is the current highest point of February.Alternatively, if the previously-mentioned upside line breaks and the pair falls below the 126.70 hurdle, marked by the low of Feb. 11, that could also place the rate below the 200 EMA on our 4-hour chart. This may be seen as a bearish indication and more sellers could join in. EUR/JPY might then drift to the 126.43 obstacle, a break of which may clear the path to the 126.10 level. That level is marked by the current lowest point of February.EUR/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nThe US building permits and housing starts for\u00a0January are\u00a0coming out, and they are both expected to have declined somewhat from their December readings.\u00a0We also get the initial jobless claims for last week, with the forecast pointing to a small decline, to 765k from 793k the week before.\n\nWith regards to the energy market, we get the EIA (Energy Information Administration) report on crude oil inventories for last week, with the forecast pointing to a 2.429mn barrels decline following a 6.644mn fall the week before.\u00a0Yesterday, the API reported a 5.800mn barrels slide and thus, we would consider the risks surrounding the EIA forecast as tilted to the downside. Combined with the ongoing deep freeze in Texas, this is likely to boost oil prices even further.\n\nTonight, during the Asian morning Friday, Japan\u2019s National CPIs for January are due to be released.

This is has been a little surprising especially as the reflation trade has been expected. The EURCHF should be a pair that would find gains on a global synchronised recovery.\n\nHowever, one of the reasons for the euro weakness is the expectations of a double-dip recession. The Eurozone has been slow in vaccinating its population in comparison to the US. If the US economy shows a faster than expected return to normality then any dollar strength will weigh on the euro. Furthermore, the CHF has been gaining as a safe haven currency on risk-off trading surrounding COVID-19 concerns. So, there have been reasons the EURCHF has been pressured.\n\n\n\nHowever, with that being said, there is a decent case to be made for the EURCHF to make a recovery from here. The CHF has long been bought since the Global Financial Crisis and had its shock highs against the EUR as the EURCHF peg was removed. That area serves as the \u2018catastrophic floor\u2019. At present, there is not a reason for the EURCHF to fall back below that level. Especially as the SNB is intervening in the EURCH pair to stop it from going too low. Remember the SNB hate a strong franc.\n\nIf economies are set to rebound on a synchronised global growth narrative then the EURCHF could be a good pair to consider.\n\nThe risk, of course, is that the strength in the CHF is sounding a warning note against the deflation narrative and that markets have got ahead of themselves in the vaccine euphoria. However, will the EURCH FSNB floor hold whatever? There could be a strong case made that they would. The only factor to remember is that the last time the EURCHF had a floor at 1.2000, it went horribly long. So, make sure leverage levels are low/at zero.\n\n\n\nLearn more about HYCM\n"}, {"headline": "DXY vs S&P's vs Gold", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zsN8_u4ssqAGXoQvoV4ofA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/76825f5773348b586328b2db07473959", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "To respectfully indulge words from the last post for context:\n\nOverall, EUR/USD was the first currency in August 2020 to break above its 5 year average at 1.1300\u2019s then the 10 year average in December 2020 at 1.2100\u2019s. EUR/USD is categorized in the class of a risk asset and non USD currency.\n\nEUR/USD\u2019s early break to its 5 year average set remainder 27 currencies on a course of deep perspective as non USD currency pairs had to not only match EUR/USD\u2019s break to significant averages but the 1000 pip rise in GBP/USD, 700 for AUD/USD and other non USD currency pairs traded weekly from overbought to overbought and a non normal price circumstance. EUR/USD\u2019s break threw normal price markets deeply off course since August 2020.\n\nNon USD currency pairs such as DXY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY only option since August 2020 was to concur with EUR/USD and non USD rises by trading deeply oversold week to week and to break 5 and 10 year averages.\n\nEUR/USD and non USD currency pairs as risk assets followed risk asset counterparts in stock markets higher to current richter scale overbought levels. The S&P's at 3900.00's trade at\u00a0 extreme overbought levels. The DAX achieved all time highs. Stock market longs are virtually impossible until a significant correction occurs.\n\nDXY\n\nDXY for example just broke above its 10 year monthly average at 89.95 and contains a long way to travel to the 5 year average at 95.00\u2019s. A currency pair to trade at a 10 year monthly average is not only a low, low price but extraordinary and highlights the magnitude to the\u00a0 rises and falls since last August.\n\nNext averages above to break are located at 91.43, 92.78 then 94.39 and 94.16. DXY from monthly averages 1 to 7 years faces stiff resistance from 94.00's to 95.00's. A break through this brick wall then DXY will travel easily to 97.00's and 99.00's.\n\nDXY below 89.95 targets 86.43, 84.32 and 81.83 at extreme oversold.\n\nTargets for DXY above 89.95 are located at 90.86, above 91.43 then 92.15,\u00a0 92.47 and 92.66. Above 92.78 targets 92.87 and 92.89.\n\nDXY from current ranges from 89.95 to 92.78 trade at its widest ranges. As DXY travels higher then ranges severely compress. The opposite is true for EUR/USD as the higher it trades then ranges open much wider.\n\nDespite a low price and trade below monthly 5 year averages, DXY is mid range to oversold/ overbought.\n\nS&P's\n\nDXY viewed from the S&P's informs trade location miles above the 5 year monthly average at 2722.43 and at overbought to extremes. Overbought S&P's reveals a healthy correction is on the way, DXY higher and EUR/USD as well as non USD currency pairs to follow much lower.\n\nThe S&P's are held by immediate averages at 3257.68, 3119.54 and 2989.17. A correction targets 3598.53, 3416.84 and 3300.20. A 400 point correction to the S&P's assumes DXY travels 300 ish pips higher and\u00a0 breaks above 92.78 to trade between 92.78 to 94.39.\n\nS&P averages from 3257.68 travels every 100 points to 2200.00's at the 10 year monthly average. Current S&P's ranges are fairly suppressed however as S&P's drop then ranges expand as the downside gains progresses.\n\nGold\n\nGold trades above its 5 year monthly average at 1461.20 and trades misaligned to the S&P's. Gold and the DXY are the same assets and should trade below 5 year monthly averages while the S&P's trade above.\n\nGold's drop is held by 1815.65 and below targets 1642.17 and 1543.98. Gold is deeply overbought from a medium and long term perspective. Gold is finished above at 1943.62 and short is the only trade available.\u00a0\n\nMoving forward, long USD and DXY is the best option while short Gold and the S&P's although Gold lacks any real range capability.

The House Budget Committee is expected assemble the various pieces of President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus package this week, with the bill expected to go to the floor of the chamber on February 22. \n\nA swift approval seems relatively likely given House and Senate Democrats have paved the way to pass the majority of the coronavirus-relief package with a simple majority \u2013 in a process called reconciliation. This will likely put further downward pressure on the Greenback in the near term. \n\nMoreover, the Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment to continue purchasing at least $80 billion of Treasury securities and $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities a month \u201cuntil substantial progress has been made toward the Committee\u2019s maximum employment and price stability goals\u201d will probably cap USD\u2019s potential upside. \n\nHowever, the European Union\u2019s cumbersome vaccine rollout could hamper the EUR/USD exchange rate\u2019s upside, considering a meagre 2.65% of the population has received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. To contrast, 17.7% of the UK population and 9.44% of Americans have been inoculated with at least one dose. \n\nUpcoming fourth quarter GDP and employment figures could also take some wind out of the Euro\u2019s sail, if data shows a worse than expected slowdown in the final three months of 2020.

Clearing that likely paves the way for buyers to drive the exchange rate towards the yearly high (1.2349). \n\nAlternatively, slipping back below range support at 1.2055 \u2013 1.2075 could neutralize buying pressure and trigger a downside push back towards the monthly low (1.1952). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 39.06% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.56 to 1.

The battle between the bulls and bears remains fierce, and until now, there is no clear winner.\n\nAs the year started, most bank analysts anticipated a weaker US dollar, and in the first few days, that outlook looked right as the DXY declined by 0.81%. Yet, just six days into the New Year, the DXY started to trade higher and was up by 1.81% by February 4. The near term outlook is neutral, but the dollar index might be on its way to carving out a bearish head and shoulders pattern.\n\nAs we can see in the chart below, the February 17 high coincidences with the January 18 high to form what could be a symmetrical-head and shoulders pattern. The head is the 2021 high of 91.62, and a break to the neckline, and February low of 91.11, could be the start of a slide to the 88.59 level.\n\nTalking against this bearish view is the IMM/COT positioning. Speculative positioning is clearly less long the EURUSD, yet they switched their positions to GBPUSD longs instead of just closing out their bearish USD bets. The U+S Dollar remains, therefore, extremely oversold against EUR, JPY, GBP, CHF, CAD, AUD, NZD, MXN, BRL, and RUB. We would need to go back to 2011 to see the market this bearish against the USD.\n\nAn alternative take on the market is that the Dollar index will ultimately trade above the right shoulder high at 91.05, and therefore trigger the so-called the \u201cfailed-head-and-shoulders-pattern.\u201d This pattern suggests that a break to the right shoulder might lift the DXY to 92.57. The pattern target is derived by taking the difference between the neckline and head and adding it to the right- shoulder high. Ideally, the DXY would trade closer to the neckline before trying to take out the right- shoulder high. Nonetheless, this pattern is usually difficult to trade.\n\nWhat is clear from all of this is that the DXY will most likely consolidate further in the days ahead.\n\n\n"}, {"headline": "FOREX-Dollar heavy as clues sought on pace of U.S. recovery; bitcoin near record high By Reuters", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/qDKfh9J6wGzmRVc3EpERBA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/881f70ead22a21b00ca2fe4680c27e31", "auther": "Stock ", "body": "* Graphic: World FX rates https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E By Kevin Buckland TOKYO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The dollar started the week pinnednear two-week lows on Monday as traders questioned whether therecovery from the pandemic in the United States would be as fastas expected.

Hiring has been slow but we expect businesses to be optimistic.\u00a0The FOMC minutes should be mildly positive for the greenback\u00a0but retail sales will be the primary driver of FX flows tomorrow.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEuro (#EUR) ended the day lower against the U.S. dollar reversing shortly before the U.S. equity market open. Eurozone data was better than expected with Germany and the Eurozone ZEW survey ticking higher.\u00a0According to the President of the ZEW institute, \"The financial market experts are optimistic about the future. They are confident that the German economy will be back on the growth track within the next six months.\u201d\u00a0However the current conditions assessment was weaker in Germany which means the economy is performing worse than they initially anticipated.\u00a0Eurozone fourth quarter GDP was revised slightly higher but better than expected U.S. data and a snapback in the dollar drove EUR/USD (#EURUSD) down to 1.21.\u00a0\n\n#GBP/USD\u00a0hit a fresh 35 month high at the start of Asian trade before pulling back during the NY session.\u00a0Inflation is in focus for the UK with January CPI data scheduled for release tomorrow.\u00a0Inflation is rising across the globe and the UK will be no exception.\u00a0The latest PMI reports confirmed that prices are rising in the manufacturing and services sector.\u00a0Of all the major economies, the U.K.\u2019s vaccine rollout has been the most successful which will pay dividends for growth in the months ahead.\u00a0So while sterling may be down against the dollar, we expect it to outperform other major currencies.\u00a0\n\nAll three of the commodity currencies gave up earlier gains to trade lower against the U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar (#CAD) fell the most on the back of lower prices and a stronger U.S. dollar.\u00a0Like the U.K., inflation data is scheduled for release tomorrow.\u00a0The price component of IVEY PMI surged signaling stronger price pressures in Canada.\u00a0The Australian dollar (#AUD) was hit by RBA minutes which showed the central bank looking to maintain significant monetary support for some time. \u00a0A 3 day lockdown and weaker New Zealand service sector activity drove\u00a0#NZD/USD\u00a0lower.\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "FOREX-Dollar in doldrums as recovery optimism thrives",

"auther": "", "body": "By Samuel Indyk\n\nInvesting.com \u2013 GBP continues to strengthen with GBP/USD breaking back above 1.39 and EUR/GBP falling to its lowest level since April last year.\n\nThe pound has been one of the better performing currencies of 2021 as the UK pushes ahead with its vaccination programme and after the Bank of England effectively ruled out negative interest rates in the near term at their February meeting.\n\nThe pair currently tests its lows from April 2020 which was seen 0.8671 and some technical analysts have suggested a firm break below that level could push the pair down towards 0.8500 if downside momentum were to accelerate. Of note, there are large sized options expiring at 0.8700 in EUR/GBP (546mln) at today\u2019s 10am NY cut.\n\nAs mentioned, GBP/USD trades back above 1.3900 and looks set to test the high seen on Tuesday at 1.3952. A break above that level could see the psychological 1.4000 level come into play.\n\nGBP has benefitted from the UK\u2019s vaccination effort with almost 16mln people now given at least one dose of one of the jabs. The EU\u2019s rollout has been less successful and yesterday there were reports that some AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) vaccines in the EU were going unused amid concerns from health workers in France and Germany about side effects. If the UK keeps vaccinating at the same rate, there is hope that at least every adult who wants a vaccine may be able to have one by the summer, prompting hopes that the economy can reopen sooner rather than later and a sense of normality will return.\n\nBank of England policymaker Andy Haldane has recently spoken of the huge pent-up demand waiting to be released. \"The recovery should be one to remember after a year to forget,\" Haldane said. The Bank of England's chief economist said we could see double digit annual growth and inflation on target. If he's right then the GBP could still have further to run.  \n\n \n"}, {"headline": "Euro Forecast: EUR/USD Week Ahead Outlook Poor, EUR/GBP Tumbling", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "14 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/J2FUOdFaRD83tTJLF4kORA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/deac15356c96103e2feea70e897e9dd9", "auther": "", "body": "The continuing prospect of a substantial pandemic relief package in the US, along with the relative success of the country\u2019s vaccination program, have combined to raise hopes that the US will lead the global economy out of the slump caused by the spread of Covid-19 but also to increase fears of a jump in inflation. Those fears have raised the yields on US Treasury bonds and notes, strengthening the US Dollar against most other currencies and, with few signs yet that the climb in USD is coming to an end, the consequent weakness in EUR/USD so far this year looks set to persist in the week ahead.\n\nSource: IG (You can click on it for a larger image)\n\nMeanwhile, there is also no sign yet that EUR/GBP will pull out of this year\u2019s dive. Like the US, the UK economy is expected to rebound strongly thanks to a successful vaccination program and loose fiscal policy. Also like the US, UK Gilt yields are rising and inflation is expected to climb. As a result, EUR/GBP\u2019s steep losses will likely continue.\n\nSource: IG (You can click on it for a larger image)\n\nIn fact, the Euro looks weak all round, as shown by the chart below of the Euro against the currencies of all the Eurozone\u2019s major trading partners, and will likely lose more ground against them unless the EU can persuade investors that it is getting its vaccination program on track \u2013 particularly as opposition mounts to the AstraZeneca version in several EU countries.\n\nSource: ECB (You can click on it for a larger image)\n\nAnother point for traders to be aware of is that over the past few days economic data releases have become important again, with the US retail sales and UK inflation figures both moving the markets. In the week ahead there are few official releases from the Eurozone but plenty of confidence figures that need to be monitored closely if trading the Euro.\n\nThe standout release is Monday\u2019s Ifo index of German business confidence in February, which is followed Wednesday by French business confidence figures. Both German and French consumer confidence data are released Thursday, as are a batch of confidence numbers for the Eurozone as a whole. Clearly, signs that sentiment is improving in the Eurozone would help the Euro while any indication that confidence is flagging would damage it.\n\nWe look at currencies regularly in the DailyFX Trading Global Markets Decoded podcasts that you can find here on Apple or wherever you go for your podcasts\n\n--- Written by Martin Essex, Analyst\n\nFeel free to contact me on Twitter @MartinSEssex\n"}, {"headline": "British Pound (GBP) Outlook: GBP/USD and EUR/GBP Weekly Forecasts", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "17 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/iEdA_HVDfp5Yu4EQwscSJA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/487d9e06abbf14d0933542ee3caea2fc", "auther": "Nick Cawley", "body": "At the risk of sounding like a broken record, GBP/USD continues to edge higher with 14 of the last 16 weekly candles positive.

We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests GBP/USD prices may continue to rise.Traders are further net-short than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger GBP/USD-bullish contrarian trading bias.\n\nA sorry looking chart for EUR/GBP bulls with this week\u2019s sell-off in particular breaking below some important levels. The first to go was the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at 0.8747 before a cluster of old lows around 0.8670 to 0.8680. With these levels seemingly in the rear mirror, a full retrace back to the February 19, 2020 low print at 0.8282 is the likely longer-term objective. The chart does look oversold, using the CCI reading, and the Euro is also picking up a small bid so the next week may see a limited move. As long as the pair stays below the 0.8750 level, then the move lower will remain intact.\n\nTraders of all levels and abilities will find something to help them make more informed decisions in the new and improved DailyFX Trading Education Centre\n\nWhat is your view on Sterling \u2013 bullish or bearish??

Having opened the session closer to the 0.8750-mark, EUR/GBP has now dropped into the low 0.8720s and the bears have their sights set on a test of the 0.8700 level.\n\nLooking at the pair over a long-term time horizon, it continues to move south within the parameters of a long-term downwards trend channel, which it has respected very well over the past few months. For reference, a downtrend linking the 31 December 2020, 20 and 21 January and 5 February lows form the lower parameter of this downtrend, whilst a downtrend linking the 22, 26 and 28 January highs and 4 and 11 February highs forms the upper parameter of this downtrend. Beyond the 0.8700, it is likely that the bears will be targeting another test of the lower bands of this trend channel, which is likely to come into play around the 0.8680 area.\n\nThe UK hit a key vaccination milestone over the weekend; the country managed to hit a self-imposed target to vaccinate 15M of its most Covid-19 vulnerable citizens by mid-February. Everyone in the first four priority groups in the country has now at least been offered a vaccine. Meanwhile, internal government forecasts reportedly expect the number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients to half over the next month.\n\nGiven the above optimism, the UK government is understandable optimistic and UK PM Boris Johnson said over the weekend that he is to layout his re-opening roadmap on 22 February. Johnson said he will prioritise the re-opening of schools (which is likely to happen on 8 March). The next steps will be to allow non-essential retail to re-open, followed by hospitality. Restrictions on socialising may also be eased on 8 March, with people likely to be permitted to meet with friends as long as it is outdoors, as well as the resumption of some outdoor sports. Note that amid the vaccine success, the PM is facing strong pressure from lockdown-skeptic Conservative MPs who want a rapid easing of restrictions from April.\n\nAll of the above factors continue to underpin GBP outperformance versus the majority of its G10 counterparts; the country\u2019s rapid vaccine rollout and drastic recent improvement in Covid-19 infection trends set the stage for the country to be able to confidently lift Covid-19 related economic restrictions significantly ahead of other developed market peers such as the EU, whose vaccination programme lags the UK\u2019s woefully. This sets the stage for UK economic outperformance versus the EU later in the year, which is boosting GBP.\n\nNote that though infection rates have been dropping on the mainland, concerns linger regarding the spread of Covid-19 variants (such as that first found in the UK or South Africa); advisors to Italian Health Minister have reportedly been suggesting that the country should impose another nationwide lockdown amid concerns over the spread of new Covid-19 variants. Talk of tougher restrictions in the EU highlights whilst there is all this talk of re-opening in the UK highlights the divergent fortunes of the two economic zones and maybe helping to weigh on EUR/GBP.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/GBP slides under 0.8700, eyes key support at 0.8670", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/cWIOpkPpRsIX.wo9rhFT_A--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/829ef55ffa8e1b86fecbeb75646199c2", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "EUR/GBP looks on course for a fourth consecutive day of losses on Wednesday, having now broken convincingly to the south of the 0.8700 level. Needless to say, this means the pair has hit fresh multi-month lows. EUR/GBP is eyeing a test of a long-term downtrend that has been supporting the price action since 31 December 2020, which is likely to come into play if EUR/GBP falls into the 0.8660s. Prior to testing this downtrend, however, the pair is going to have to contend with a key support level in the form of the April 2020 low at just under 0.8670. At present, the pair trades in the 0.8680s, down about 0.2% or just under 20 pips on the day.\n\nGBP continues to outperform its mainland counterpart in what seems to be a continuation of the \u201cvaccine trade\u201d; i.e. the idea that the UK\u2019s comparatively rapid vaccine rollout will facilitate a swifter economic reopening, which will lead to UK economic outperformance versus the Eurozone later in the year. Latest reports suggest the government is hoping that all UK adults will have received both of their Covid-19 vaccines by the end of August/September. That compares to expectations in the EU that only 70% of adults will have received ever their first dose of a vaccine by the end of September. Note that a number of desks are turning a little more cautious on GBP given the speed of its rally versus the likes of the euro. ING warned on Tuesday that GBP was starting to look a little overvalued on their short-term fair valuation models and are, as such, turning a little more cautious in the currency in the coming weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, a few other UK domestic factors might also be offering some support to sterling; UK press reports suggest that UK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak might be thinking about reducing employer national insurance contributions and reinstating the \u00a31000 job retention bonus for every worker an employer brings back from furlough. This amounts to more fiscal stimulus and is unlikely to be seen as a negative in the eyes of GBP traders.\n\nBut Sunak is facing pressure from various UK think tanks to increase the level of fiscal stimulus more in line with that of the US; the Institute for Public Policy Research is calling for Britain to \u201cact big\u201d with a \u00a3190B stimulus package to avoid a vicious cycle of business bankruptcies, lay-offs and depressed demand. \u201cThe risk of doing too little far outweighs the risk of doing too much. Joe Biden has understood this. Rishi Sunak should follow his lead,\u201d said Carsten Jung, senior economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research.\n\nElsewhere, UK inflation numbers collected in January were released prior to the start of European trade; headline inflation rose to 0.7% YoY from 0.6% in December, a little above expectations for it to remain unchanged at 0.6%. The YoY rate of Core inflation was also a tad higher than expected, coming in at 1.4% versus forecasts for a 1.3% reading. Meanwhile, Producer Input Prices rose at 1.3% YoY in January, much higher than expectations for a reading of 0.6%.\n\nAccording to UBS Chief Economist Paul Donovan, UK inflation may well be worth watching in the future; the speed and the scale of the UK\u2019s vaccine rollout may mean that the forced savings UK consumers have accumulated over the last year amid lockdown restrictions may well be spent earlier than in other countries whose vaccination programmes lag (assuming restrictions in the UK are eased earlier). The UK may thus serve as an indicator of how post-vaccination \u201creopening\u201d might impact price growth in other countries. Donovan notes that the drop in the UK\u2019s population seen in 2020 (as immigrants preferred to travel home to spend lockdown there) may translate into labour shortages as the service sector opens back up again, which could push up prices. Donovan caveats that spare slack in the economy (i.e. higher levels of unemployment in those who have remained in the UK) and the potential for productivity gains may mitigate these cost pressures.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/GBP on course for fifth consecutive day in the red with sterling still in favour", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Z7RdnSEZi1YBJ4cnSGqKsQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/b8641d0b92cce97940c26539456146a4", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "EUR/GBP losses have accelerated on Thursday; the pair, which closed below the 0.8700 level for the first time since May 2020 on Wednesday, rose back to momentarily touch 0.8700 during Thursday Asia Pacific trade. However, the arrival of European market participants saw the currency cross take a turn for the worse. EUR/GBP currently trades around the 0.8650 mark, having hit lows just above 0.8640. On the day, the pair trades with losses of about 0.2% or 20 pips and is on course for its fifth consecutive day off losses.\n\nLooking at EUR/GBP from a technical perspective, the pair has broken below a key downtrend that had been acting as support for much of the past few weeks; as the pair fell below the 0.8660s this morning, it broke below a downtrend linking the 31 December 2020, 14, 20 and 21 January and 4 Februarys lows. Thus, though the pair has come a long way over the last few weeks (dropping more than 2% since the start of the month), there may be room for further acceleration to the downside.\n\nNo standout themes or news appear behind the price action on Thursday, though it seems that GBP continues to be a beneficiary of the vaccine trade, i.e. the notion that its world-leading vaccine rollout will facilitate a more aggressive economic recovery later in the year. GBP sits atop the G10 performance table on Thursday, up 0.6% versus the USD.\n\nIn terms of the latest news out of the UK; the Imperial College React study (which tests tens of thousands of people over the course of months at a time) shows that Covid-19 infections have dropped by around two-thirds since the start of the latest national lockdown. On average, the study found that on average 1.57% of people were infected with the virus in early-January, but this has dropped to just 0.51% as of mid-February. In London, the infection rate has dropped from 2.83% in early-January to 0.54%. The fact that lockdown has seemingly worked well should boost government confidence about its ability to rapidly begin to reopen its economy over the summer.\n\nGBP has not been fazed too much by a downbeat survey from the Resolution Foundation, released on Thursday, which showed 2.6M UK employees expect to lose their jobs over the next three months. The survey will up the pressure on UK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak to implement another extension of the furlough scheme and BoE Deputy Governor Michael Saunders said that he would be placing a high weight on labour market outcomes. In other words, if things to take a significant turn for the worse in the UK jobs market, further easing is likely.\n\nTurning to the euro; though suffering versus sterling, the single currency is actually performing quite well versus the majority of the rest of its G10 counterparts. This could be a reflection of the Draghi effect; Italian PM Mario Draghi's government coalition won a vote of confidence in the Senate on Wednesday, with lawmakers voting 262 vs 40 in favour of his new government. The Lower House is expected to also vote in favour and then Draghi can begin pressing ahead with his domestic agenda. Markets seem to have high hopes that Draghi will be able to breathe some life back into the Covid-19 stricken Italian economy, as well as aid further progression of the EU project.\n\nEuro traders appear not too worried about concerning reports that AstraZeneca vaccines have been going to waste in Germany amid health care worker fears about its side effects. German health officials have been urging that the vaccine is safe for use, but mistrust of the vaccine (which has not been helped by recent AstraZeneca vaccine negative comments from various EU officials) may hamper the bloc\u2019s already sluggish vaccine rollout. \u00a0\n\nECB minutes were largely ignored and did not contain any new information on policy. Note that the bank appears to have shifted emphasis towards maintaining ease financing conditions, rather than talking about its price stability mandate, perhaps in anticipation of higher but transitory inflation ahead. This tactic may be aimed at avoiding markets falling into the trap of thinking that the ECB is going to start tightening monetary conditions at the first sign of inflation going above its target.\n\nFinally, the preliminary estimate of January Consumer Confidence in the Eurozone was just released, coming in a tad above expectations at -14.8 (consensus was for -15.0), but down from last month\u2019s -13.9 reading. This is still well below pre-pandemic levels and Capital Economics thinks that \u201cunless vaccine programmes accelerate to allow restrictions to be lifted soon, a sustained pick up in confidence remains months away\u201d.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/GBP Price Analysis: Bulls target confluence of monthly resistance area", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/42wK0cHH0njXAe9kCnHApA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/bb4ef19827b95f1a5520b70cbfc38a97", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "EUR/GBP is offered on the session, so far, but there is a promising bullish case for the week ahead.\u00a0\n\nThe following offers a top-down analysis and illustrates why the price can be expected to move higher from a demand area.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe have a combination of a bullish monthly head and shoulders as well as a bullish\u00a0M-formation.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe price has melted into a demand area and the green candle in all of the bearish impulse is a liquidity zone for bulls to target.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe confluence of the resistance area, or the M-formation's neckline, with the liquidity of prior support as well as a confluence of the\u00a0Fibonacci zone across, multiple time frames,\u00a0is a compelling upside target for the bulls.\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "US Dollar Price Action Setups: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, USD/JPY", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/7my6vELlhsolWkp4HPp58g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/063085c9015523ec17ebca884f284d8c", "auther": "James Stanley", "body": "It was a wash week in the US Dollar as the currency is looking to finish the week very close to where it had started. It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "Chart Of The Day: EUR/USD May Have Started Ascent Towards 1.25 | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Fawad Razaqzada", "body": "This article was written exclusively for Investing.com\n\nToday\u2019s EU and UK manufacturing PMIs surprised to the upside and both the pound and euro rallied, with the cable hitting that $1.40 hurdle I have been forecasting for a while and GBP/CHF climbing to my 1.25 long-term target.\n\nMy focus is now turning to the euro, which could be about to break out soon and potentially head towards the 1.25 area next.\n\nWith the GBP/USD making its move first, the EUR/USD is now highly likely, in my opinion, to follow suit in climbing towards its own corresponding milestone of 1.25 handle next. That\u2019s because these currency pairs have a strong positive correlation with one another, as you can see below:\n\n3 months\n\n6 months\n\n1 year\n\nEUR/USD vs. GBP/USD\n\n+0.90\n\n+0.90\n\n+0.80\n\nBeyond this simple correlation matrix, there are obviously several other reasons, including both macro and technical considerations, why I am bullish on the single currency.\n\nFrom a macro point of view, the following are among some of the reasons, I hold a positive view towards the EUR/USD:\n\nMore to the point, it is the charts and price action\u2014reflecting the market\u2019s collective thoughts and actions\u2014that makes me uber-bullish on the EUR/USD.\n\nThe daily chart of the EUR/USD shows a clear bullish trend with rising moving averages and the price continuing to consolidate inside a bull flag pattern after holding its own above the key 1.20 support level:\n\nEUR/USD Daily\n\nWhat I would like to see next from a bullish point of view is a break above the shaded resistance range between 1.2150 and 1.2200. A clean break above this zone should offer decent buying opportunity on the rounded retest to potentially take us to new highs on the year.\n\nThe monthly chart is looking quite strong, too, with the long-term bear trend already having broken down in 2020 and with rates climbing and now holding above that 1.20 handle:\n\nEUR/USD Monthly\n\nThe fact that the EUR/USD has now moved back above the January 2021 low means that the sellers who were looking for a breakdown below 1.20 may have already been trapped. If the bears are indeed trapped, which I think is the case, then a quick rally above the January range, at 1.2350, is likely, where a cluster of sellers\u2019 stop orders will surely be resting\u2014thus providing a pool of liquidity for the market to reach for. This makes it likely we will see an accelerated move higher towards 1.25s in the coming weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, the EUR/USD on this long-term time frame also seems to be following the path of the 2017-18 rally when rates surged higher earlier in the year before spending a few months in consolidation ahead of more gains in early parts of 2018. Since March last year, the EUR/USD has again rallied in a very similar fashion, consolidated for a while below the 1.20 handle and then broke out again. If this is anything to go by then a rally towards, and potentially beyond, 1.25 could be on the cards next.\n\nSo, the EUR/USD charts look quite bullish. As such, I would be more inclined to look for buying than selling opportunities as things stand and in any case until the charts suggest otherwise.\n"}]}, {"id": "EUR/JPY", "price_data":

"auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "The world of FX is based on relativity, and relatively speaking, the EU is trailing other developed economies with its vaccination rates, and the EU is growing less robustly than other regions. By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/JPY Price Analysis: W-formation forms as price meets resistance", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "7 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/KkMpS2UBPuCL74KwC_Hoyg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/baf0956f0ac2936470f5b7cfb94dd8f5", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "EUR/JPY is testing a key resistance area within a broadly bullish long-term trend.\n\nThe following is a top-down analysis which illustrates where the next potential opportunity can be expected from forthcoming price action and structure.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe bulls are in charge and an upside extension can be expected.\n\nHowever, there is resistance at this juncture and the price will most likely offer downside opportunities on the lower time frames first of all.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe price is trapped between support and resistance from a weekly perspective.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThere are prospects of an upside extension prior to a daily correction to the neckline of the W-formation, or, if the price moves significantly higher, an extended W-formation will be the outcome.\n\nIn such a circumstance, the current resistance would be expected to act as support instead.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nFrom an hourly perspective, with the price meeting resistance, a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement meets the structure and a correction can be expected.

That\u2019s because these currency pairs have a strong positive correlation with one another, as you can see below:\n\n3 months\n\n6 months\n\n1 year\n\nEUR/USD vs. GBP/USD\n\n+0.90\n\n+0.90\n\n+0.80\n\nBeyond this simple correlation matrix, there are obviously several other reasons, including both macro and technical considerations, why I am bullish on the single currency.\n\nFrom a macro point of view, the following are among some of the reasons, I hold a positive view towards the EUR/USD:\n\nMore to the point, it is the charts and price action\u2014reflecting the market\u2019s collective thoughts and actions\u2014that makes me uber-bullish on the EUR/USD.\n\nThe daily chart of the EUR/USD shows a clear bullish trend with rising moving averages and the price continuing to consolidate inside a bull flag pattern after holding its own above the key 1.20 support level:\n\nEUR/USD Daily\n\nWhat I would like to see next from a bullish point of view is a break above the shaded resistance range between 1.2150 and 1.2200. A clean break above this zone should offer decent buying opportunity on the rounded retest to potentially take us to new highs on the year.\n\nThe monthly chart is looking quite strong, too, with the long-term bear trend already having broken down in 2020 and with rates climbing and now holding above that 1.20 handle:\n\nEUR/USD Monthly\n\nThe fact that the EUR/USD has now moved back above the January 2021 low means that the sellers who were looking for a breakdown below 1.20 may have already been trapped. If the bears are indeed trapped, which I think is the case, then a quick rally above the January range, at 1.2350, is likely, where a cluster of sellers\u2019 stop orders will surely be resting\u2014thus providing a pool of liquidity for the market to reach for. This makes it likely we will see an accelerated move higher towards 1.25s in the coming weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, the EUR/USD on this long-term time frame also seems to be following the path of the 2017-18 rally when rates surged higher earlier in the year before spending a few months in consolidation ahead of more gains in early parts of 2018. Since March last year, the EUR/USD has again rallied in a very similar fashion, consolidated for a while below the 1.20 handle and then broke out again. If this is anything to go by then a rally towards, and potentially beyond, 1.25 could be on the cards next.\n\nSo, the EUR/USD charts look quite bullish. As such, I would be more inclined to look for buying than selling opportunities as things stand and in any case until the charts suggest otherwise.\n"}, {"headline": "Rising Yields Pressure Equities, ECB Minutes On The Agenda | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y JFD Team", "body": "Equities continued to pull back yesterday and today in Asia, perhaps as rising inflation expectations continued to push bond yields higher.

In Asia, sentiment was soft again, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and South Korea\u2019s KOSPI falling 0.19%, 1.70% and 1.50% respectively.\n\nThe exception was China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, which gained 0.55% on its first trading day after the Lunar New Year celebrations.Major global stock indices performanceEquities continued to pull back, perhaps as rising inflation expectations continued to push bond yields higher, with the benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield hitting its highest in a year yesterday. This means that the reflation trade could prove to be positive for equities but only to the point where the rise in bond yields is considered too fast, which could raise speculation over monetary-policy tapering by major central banks.\n\nHowever, we believe that it is too early for something like that and the minutes from the latest FOMC meeting add credence to our view.\u00a0Yes, officials noted that PCE prices \u2013 their favorite inflation metric \u2013 were projected to move briefly above 2% in the second quarter of 2021, but this would prove to be temporary and eventually inflation is expected to finish the year at just below 2%.\n\nInflation was projected to moderate overshoot 2% for some time in the years beyond 2023, but with monetary policy assumed to remain accommodative.\u00a0Thus, with no signs of tapering any time soon, we believe that equities have the potential to rebound again, and safe havens to come under renewed selling interest.\n\nToday, the item on the agenda which could attract some special attention may be the minutes from the latest ECB policy gathering. Despite the lockdown measures around the Eurozone, at the press conference following that decision, President Lagarde said that the downside risks to the economic outlook are now \u201cless pronounced\u201d, making investors skeptical over further easing,\u00a0although the Bank repeated once again that it stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate.\u00a0Therefore, we will scan the minutes to see whether Lagarde\u2019s view is shared among other officials as well, and whether indeed the chances for more easing have lessened for now. Something like that may benefit somewhat the euro.\n\nAfter finding resistance near the 30717 barrier on Tuesday, Nikkei 225 started correcting lower. That said, the downmove might get halted, if the short-term tentative upside line, drawn from the low of Jan. 31, continues to provide support. For now, we will take a cautiously-bullish approach.\n\nAs mentioned above, if the aforementioned upside line remains intact, the bulls may take advantage of the lower price and lift it up again. That\u2019 when we will target yesterday\u2019s high, at 30585, or the 30717 barrier, marked by the current highest point of this week. Initially, Nikkei 225 might stall there for a bit, or even correct back down again. However, if the index stays above the previously-mentioned upside line, another push higher could be possible. If this time the bulls are able to overcome the 30717 hurdle, the next possible target could be at 31371, marked by the highest point of August 1990.\n\nOn the other hand, if the aforementioned upside line breaks and the index also falls below the 29660 zone, marked by the high of Feb. 12, that may open the door for further declines. Nikkei 225 may then slide to the low of Feb. 10, at 29177, a break of which could set the stage for a move to the 28720 level. That level is marked near the high of Feb. 3 and by an intraday swing low of Feb. 5.Japan's Nikkei 225 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nEUR/JPY drifted to the downside yesterday, after finding resistance near the 128.45 barrier. The pair is in slight consolidation this morning; however, it may continue its journey south for a bit more. That said, as long as the rate remains above a short-term upside support line, drawn from the low of Jan. 18, this move lower might be seen as a temporary correction only.\n\nIf the rate drifts below the 127.31 zone, marked by yesterday\u2019s low, that could send the pair towards its next potential support area, near the 126.98 hurdle, marked by the low of Feb. 12. Around there, the pair may also find support from the aforementioned upside line. EUR/JPY might get picked up by the bulls there, and if so, it could travel back up to the 127.31 obstacle, or even the 127.68 hurdle, marked by an intraday swing low of Feb. 15. If the buying doesn\u2019t stop there, the next potential target might be at 127.97, or at 128.45, which is the current highest point of February.Alternatively, if the previously-mentioned upside line breaks and the pair falls below the 126.70 hurdle, marked by the low of Feb. 11, that could also place the rate below the 200 EMA on our 4-hour chart. This may be seen as a bearish indication and more sellers could join in. EUR/JPY might then drift to the 126.43 obstacle, a break of which may clear the path to the 126.10 level. That level is marked by the current lowest point of February.EUR/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nThe US building permits and housing starts for\u00a0January are\u00a0coming out, and they are both expected to have declined somewhat from their December readings.\u00a0We also get the initial jobless claims for last week, with the forecast pointing to a small decline, to 765k from 793k the week before.\n\nWith regards to the energy market, we get the EIA (Energy Information Administration) report on crude oil inventories for last week, with the forecast pointing to a 2.429mn barrels decline following a 6.644mn fall the week before.\u00a0Yesterday, the API reported a 5.800mn barrels slide and thus, we would consider the risks surrounding the EIA forecast as tilted to the downside. Combined with the ongoing deep freeze in Texas, this is likely to boost oil prices even further.\n\nTonight, during the Asian morning Friday, Japan\u2019s National CPIs for January are due to be released.

Here are the key levels to watch for GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, EUR/GBP and GBP/NZD rates. \n\nGBP/USD daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nGBP/USD looks set to extend its recent push to fresh multi-year highs, as prices burst past psychological resistance at 1.3800. \n\nHowever, bearish RSI divergence suggests that bullish momentum may be fading. Nevertheless, with price tracking above all six moving averages, and the MACD hovering firmly above its neutral midpoint, the path of least resistance seems higher. \n\nA daily close above the February 10 high (1.3866) probably signals the resumption of the primary uptrend and carves a path for buyers to challenge the 61.8% Fibonacci (1.3956). Clearing that brings 1.4000 into the crosshairs. \n\nAlternatively, sliding back below the 8-EMA (1.3797) could trigger a short-term pullback to its \u2018slower\u2019 34-period counterpart (1.3663). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 31.28% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 2.20 to 1.

Piercing that likely generates a more extended pullback to the February 1 high (144.10). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 29.67% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 2.37 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 24.64% lower than yesterday and 14.29% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 0.80% lower than yesterday and 10.69% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests GBP/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed GBP/JPY trading bias.\n\nEUR/GBP daily chart created using Tradingview \n\nEUR/GBP seems poised to continue sliding to fresh yearly lows, as price accelerates away from the 8-EMA. \n\nWith the RSI eyeing a push into oversold territory, and the slopes of all three EMAs markedly steepening to the downside, further losses look likely in the near term. \n\nA daily close below the February 5 low (0.8738) likely signals the resumption of the primary downtrend and brings range support at 0.8670 \u2013 0.8690 into play. \n\nConversely, if 0.8730 successfully neutralizes selling pressure, a rebound back towards 0.8800 could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 61.08% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.57 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 2.66% higher than yesterday and 0.54% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 14.00% lower than yesterday and 24.87% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests EUR/GBP prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week.

On the day, the pair trades with modest gains of about 20 pips or 0.15%.\n\nEUR/USD is seemingly back trading in last Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s 1.2120ish-1.2150ish range. It may take a more pronounced weakening of the US dollar (i.e. the Dollar Index dropping back towards 21 January lows of just above the 90.00 level) in order for the pair to break above 1.2150, given subdued appetite towards the euro at the moment. Above 1.2150, however, EUR/USD will find resistance in the form of the 50-day moving average at 1.2155.\n\nSafe havens assets (such as JPY, USD and US government bonds) are struggling on the first trading day of the week, despite the absence of Chinese and North American market participants, both of whom are celebrating respective public holidays (Presidents\u2019 Day in America and still midway through Lunar New Year celebrations in China). Global equity and crude oil markets have been rallying given optimism regarding the state of the global pandemic (the UK hit the crucial milestone of vaccinating it\u2019s 15M most vulnerable citizens and the US is seeing a continued drop in the infection rate whilst it ramps up its vaccination efforts).\n\nPositive pandemic news comes against the already favourable backdrop of expectations for more US fiscal stimulus, ongoing global central bank support and a rapid global economic expansion to begin later in the year as populations in key developed markets hit herd immunity. Hence, US equity index futures have been pushing on to fresh all-time high levels on Monday and US bond yields are also rising (the 10-year is now above 1.21%), though, importantly for USD, real yields remain low (the 10-year TIPS sits at -1.02%). For rising nominal yields to be bullish for the US dollar, they will have to be accompanied by rising real yields (which would make the USD a more attractive investment relative to other currencies).\n\nDespite broad weakness in the US dollar versus the majority of its G10 counterparts (aside from JPY, which is being hit even worse), EUR/USD has failed to garner much by way of upside impetus. Part of that will be due to the lack of market volume at the moment given the absence of US and Chinese players in the market on Monday (due to public holidays). But that does not explain euro underperformance against the likes of GBP, CAD, AUD and NZD.\n\nEuro underperformance versus risk-sensitive FX (like the Australian, Kiwi and Canadian dollars) makes sense given the market\u2019s risk-on tone. Euro weakness versus pound sterling seems to have more to do with the EU\u2019s comparatively sluggish vaccination efforts versus the UK; as noted, the UK hit its 15M vaccinations by mid-February target over the weekend. Nearly one-quarter of the citizens in the UK have now been vaccinated. That compares to just 5% in Germany, 4.9% in Italy, 4.4% in France and 5.3% in Spain. Meanwhile, the US has vaccinated 16% of its population and is not too far behind the UK.\n\nAs long as vaccinations do remain effective against the various Covid-19 variants spreading across the world at the moment, the US and UK are set to reopen their economies much sooner than the EU. For example, the UK is targeting getting the first jab in the arms of all of its adult populations by the end of May. By contrast the EU is expecting to have fully vaccinated only 70% of its adults by the end of September. The Eurozone\u2019s sluggish vaccination performance may well weigh on the euro further.\n\nMeanwhile, though infection rates have been dropping on the mainland, concerns linger regarding the spread of Covid-19 variants (such as that first found in the UK or South Africa); advisors to Italian Health Minister have reportedly been suggesting that the country should impose another nationwide lockdown amid concerns over the spread of new Covid-19 variants. Talk of tougher restrictions in the EU could highlight the bloc\u2019s divergent fortunes when compared to the US and UK, where the momentum is towards easing restrictions.\n\nIn terms of Eurozone news flow on Monday, data this morning was mixed; the bloc\u2019s trade surplus was a little larger than expected in December at EUR 29.2B versus forecasts for a reading of EUR 25.3B. However, Industrial Production data for the same month was a disappointment; the YoY rate of production growth came in at a sluggish -0.8% versus forecasts for -0.3% and the MoM rate of production growth showed a larger than expected monthly drop of 1.6% (versus forecasts for -1.0%).\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD Vs USD/JPY and the FX Cross Pair Divide", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/rNkBPK9aa9Jmz49Ee7qjAg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/1bc8588b51831e795c1f03b377aa14d3", "auther": "Brian Twomey", "body": "Overall currency markets are in the great deadlock between natural opposites EUR/USD and USD/JPY.

The risk-related sentiment turned sour and Wall Street plummeted after its overseas counterpart traded dully. Optimism faded after the European Central Bank published the Meeting Accounts, as policymakers noted that ample monetary stimulus remains essential, pretty much the same stance the US Federal Reserve offered a day before. Softer Treasury yields also played their role, pushing the dollar lower.\n\nData wise, the US published Initial Jobless Claims for the week ended February 12. The number of people seeking jobs increased to 861K, much worse than the 765K expected, and in line with the Fed\u2019s view of a softening recovery in the sector. January Housing Starts plunged 6% in the month, while Building Permits were up 10.4%. The EU released the Consumer Confidence Indicator, which rose to -14.8 in February from -15.5 in the previous month.\n\nThis Friday, the focus will be on Markit preliminary estimates of its PMIs for the EU and the US.

Throughout the American session, the pair has met buyers around 1.2060, where the pair has the 38.2% retracement of its November/January rally.

On a year-over-year basis, GDP is projected to decrease by 5.1%.\n\nMeanwhile, ZEW Economic Sentiment Index is expected to decline from 58.3 in January to 57 in February.

The country also published the January Producer Price Index, which was up 1.7% yearly basis, and Industrial Production for the same month, which surged 0.9%.\n\nThe FOMC published the Minutes of their latest meeting, which showed that policymakers believe it\u2019s premature to talk about tapering QE, as assets purchases would remain at current levels until Q1 2022.

Having said that, I do not necessarily see the catalyst to go much higher, due to the fact that the European Union has rolling lockdowns and of course concerns about vaccinations being distributed, and then we have the interest rates in America rising, which does make the US dollar little bit more attractive.\n\nHaving said that, I think this is more or less back and forth and noisy trading. I think it is going to be difficult to trade this from a longer-term perspective in the short term, but one would have to believe that we are trying to build a case to go higher.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Go Parabolic \n-  GBP/USD Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Fly High \n-  GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Strengthen \n-  USD/CAD Daily Forecast \u2013 Test Of Support At 1.2590 \n-  Silver Price Forecast \u2013 Silver Markets for Massive Hammer \n-  USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Testing 200 Day EMA \n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Test Of Support At 1.2040", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zb1lFkogzWteS9LmeC3A1w--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/5c5774da082fc81d10a83461cce6fd6a", "auther": "Vladimir Zernov", "body": "EUR/USD Video 18.02.21.\n\nEUR/USD is currently testing the support at 1.2040 while the U.S. dollar is flat against a broad basket of currencies.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index is currently stuck in the range between 90.90 and 91. If the U.S. Dollar Index manages to get above the 91 level, it will head towards the resistance level at 91.10 which will be bearish for EUR/USD.\n\nToday, foreign exchange market traders will focus on the economic data from the U.S. Initial Jobless Claims report is expected to show that 765,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits in a week. Continuing Jobless Claims are projected to decline from 4.55 million to 4.4 million.\n\nTraders will also have a chance to take a look at U.S. housing data. Building Permits are expected to decline by 3.5% month-over-month in January while Housing Starts are projected to decrease by 0.7%.\n\nThe market will also remain focused on the developments in the U.S. government bond market. Treasury yields have pulled back from recent highs but this move did not put any pressure on the U.S. dollar. If yields continue to increase, the U.S. dollar may get additional support.\n\nEUR/USD managed to settle below the support level at 1.2060 and is trying to settle above the next support level which is located at 1.2040. EUR/USD made an attempt to settle below this level during yesterday\u2019s trading session but failed to develop sufficient downside momentum.\n\nIf EUR/USD declines below the support at 1.2040, it will head towards the next support level at 1.2000. There are no important levels between 1.2000 and 1.2040 so this move may be fast. In case EUR/USD settles below the support at 1.2000, it will head towards the next support level at 1.1965.\n\nOn the upside, the previous support at 1.2060 will serve as the first resistance level for EUR/USD. If EUR/USD manages to settle above this level, it will head towards the next resistance at 1.2080. A move above this level will open the way to the test of the resistance at the 20 EMA at 1.2095.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  Economic Data Puts the EUR and Dollar in the Spotlight, with ECB Minutes also in Focus \n-  European Equities: Futures Point Northwards with Economic Data and Monetary Policy in Focus \n-  Natural Gas Price Prediction \u2013 Prices Surge but Fail at Resistance \n-  Markets Chill \n-  EUR/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Test Of Support At 1.2040 \n-  EOS, Stellar\u2019s Lumen, and Tron\u2019s TRX \u2013 Daily Analysis \u2013 February 18th, 2021 \n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Euro Runs Into Overhead Resistance", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/bf0_bI8GO8fCytFut8Pvcw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/9375816712614d40acee08aeca67f55a", "auther": "Christopher Lewis", "body": "The Euro has rallied again during the Friday session, reaching towards the 1.2150 level. This is an area that has seen a significant amount of action over the last couple of weeks, so it is not a huge surprise that we may have stopped in this general vicinity. That being said, this is a market that is going to remain choppy for quite some time from what I can see.\n\nThe 50 day EMA is running right between the two candlesticks of the last 48 hours and is relatively flat. As a widely followed longer-term trend indicator, this shows just how \u201cflat\u201d the market is right now.\n\nWhen you look at the overall charts, I do believe that the 1.20 level underneath is significant support that extends down to the 1.19 handle. All things being equal, I am looking at that as an area of the potentially bullish traders, but I also see that there is noise above that is going to cause a few headaches here and there for traders. I specifically am referring to the 1.23 level, which I believe extends all the way to the 1.25 handle.\n\nThis is a major resistance barrier that will have to be dealt with if this market is truly going to take off to the upside for a more sustained move. In the meantime, I think we are just bouncing around in a 300 PIP range, with probably a little bit more proclivity to be in the bottom half of that area, at least in the short term as it does not look like we have anywhere to be anytime soon.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n-  GBP/JPY Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 British Pound Continues to Skyrocket Against Yen \n-  Natural Gas Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Natural Gas Markets Give Up Gains \n-  Gold Price Forecast \u2013 Gold Markets Bounce from Major Support Level \n-  USD/JPY Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Continues to Grind Higher \n-  Silver Price Daily Forecast \u2013 Silver Moves Higher Ahead Of The Weekend \n-  AUD/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Australian Dollar Breaks Ou tAagain \n"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD Daily Forecast \u2013 Rising Treasury Yields Provide Support To U.S. Dollar", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FX Empire via Yahoo Finance", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/_IbnnPQG3pXNXboE7FFDHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/38689c3ca4ddcbc8bed34fa53f024cba", "auther": "Vladimir Zernov", "body": "EUR/USD Video 17.02.21.\n\nEUR/USD is currently trying to settle below the support level at 1.2080 while the U.S. dollar is gaining ground against a broad basket of currencies.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index gained upside momentum and is testing the nearest resistance level at the 50 EMA at 90.75. If this test is successful, the U.S. Dollar Index will move towards the next resistance level at 90.90 which will be bearish for EUR/USD. The yield of 30-year Treasuries has increased to 2.09% amid stimulus optimism which provides support to the American currency.\n\nYesterday, EU reported that Euro Area GDP declined by 0.6% in the fourth quarter while analysts expected that it would decrease by 0.7%\n\nZEW Economic Sentiment Index grew from 58.3 in January to 69.6 in February compared to analyst consensus of 57. The report has initially provided material support to euro, but the rapid increase in Treasury yields boosted the U.S. dollar.\n\nTraders expect that U.S. inflation will rise due to the new round of stimulus and sell U.S. government bonds, pushing their yields higher.

Rally Supported By Rise In PMI\n\nCAD Unfazed By Weaker Retail Sales\n\nThere were some big moves in currencies on Friday, which was no surprise given the busy economic calendar. GBP/USD rose above 1.40 for the first time since April 2018, while AUD/USD and NZD/USD climbed to their strongest level since March 2018. Investors looked past softer economic reports in favor of stronger releases. The U.S. dollar sold off across the board as stocks rebounded from yesterday\u2019s decline. Existing home sales and PMIs were stronger.\n\nDespite surging virus cases and widespread restrictions in the U.S. and Europe, manufacturing activity continues to chug along.\u00a0The hope is that this will continue as more people are vaccinated and restrictions are eased. Next week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell will delivery his semi-annual testimony on the economy and monetary policy. He\u2019s made it clear that no rate hikes are on the horizon and it is too soon to consider tapering asset purchases. At the same time, he\u2019s optimistic about the recovery, and expects stronger growth in the second half of the year. The combination of a positive outlook and policy accommodation is good for stocks, high-beta currencies and bad for the U.S. dollar. This week\u2019s moves could be a reflection of investors positioning for the Fed\u2019s optimism.Sterling was not the day\u2019s strongest performer (that title goes to the Australian and New Zealand dollars) but the move above 1.40 is significant. Retail sales\u00a0were terrible. Consumer spending dropped 8.2% in the month of January, three times more than expected. However, sterling bulls were unfazed by this release, choosing instead to focus on stronger PMIs. Manufacturing and service sector activity improved in February, which drove the composite rate up to 49.8 from 41.2. This is significantly stronger than the 42.2 forecast. The PMIs are more forward-looking than retail sales, but consumer spending needs to recover to keep pace with manufacturing activity otherwise manufacturing will have to slow.The return of Chinese investors drove the Australian and New Zealand dollars to fresh multi-year highs.\u00a0Both currencies rose more than 1% against the greenback intraday and the breakout after a period of consolidation in AUD/USD and NZD/USD could lead to further gains in the coming week. Australian and New Zealand data was actually disappointing, with very little producer price growth in New Zealand in the fourth quarter. In Australia, manufacturing activity slowed, while retail sales growth missed expectations. These reports would normally drive AUD/USD lower, but investors are laser focused on recovery. Virus cases are extremely low in both countries and New Zealand just lifted its three-day lockdown. The Canadian dollar also shrugged off weaker retail sales. Consumer spending dropped 3.4% at the end of last year, which was worse than the -2.5% forecast.The\u00a0euro trailed behind GBP, AUD and NZD but Eurozone's economic reports were the most encouraging.\u00a0The composite PMI index increased in the month of February thanks to stronger manufacturing activity in Germany and the Eurozone. Services continued to contract, but the strong expansion in manufacturing more than made up the difference.

With little to digest at home, the Aussie took direction from offshore outperforming early in the week. Initially the Aussie advanced as the Greenback's recent resurgence faltered in the face of rising inflation concerns spurred on by a potentially overzealous stimulus package. With the proposed package some 9% of GDP on top of the 4% of GDP proposed before Christmas there are concerns that inflation will take off. Despite the concerns, the 1-year inflation expectations figure failed to meet expectations and only rose to 1.21%, albeit still almost a yearly high for the report. Closer to home, Melbourne again entered a COVID-19 related lockdown, although for a proposed 5 days this time. Ultimately the news capped the Aussie's movements on Friday, although the broader market was sluggish in general due to Chinese New Year celebrations and a looming public holiday today in the US, Presidents' Day. Moving into a new week, the Aussie is set to enjoy a very quiet domestic docket initially with direction again to be driven by the Greenback.\n\nThe US dollar again took centre stage last week with the Greenback's behaviour dictating broader market movements. Spurred on first by rising treasury yields and lower than expected inflation levels, the Greenback initially consolidated against a basket of currencies but ultimately weakened as Federal Reserve head Powell and later US Treasury Secretary Yellen both displayed a dovish tone. The Greenback was also sold-off throughout the week as inflation concerns crept into the stimulus conversation. Nevertheless, the US dollar opens this morning at 90.45 on the US DXY and is up 0.16 against the Japanese yen and 0.07% against the Swiss franc.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the British pound turned out to be one of the better performers for the week after Q4 GDP rose by double market expectations at 1% q/q. Helped along by a softer Greenback and reports that the UK is starting to make headway in the infection rate, the Sterling rose an impressive 0.8% for the week and opens this morning at 1.3845.\n\nAUD/CAD: 0.9773 - 0.9920 \u25b2\n\nAUD/EUR: 0.6342 - 0.6437 \u25b2\n\nGBP/AUD: 1.7713 - 1.7980 \u25b2\n\nAUD/NZD: 1.0663 - 1.0824 \u25b2\n\nAUD/USD: 0.7701 - 0.7818 \u25b2\n"}, {"headline": "British Pound (GBP) Latest: GBP/USD to Head Lower, EUR/GBP Lower Too", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "App Icon Design", "auther": "", "body": "The market narrative earlier this week \u2013 that Covid-19 vaccinations will prompt the global economy to recover strongly from the slump caused by the pandemic, bringing rising inflation with it \u2013 will likely re-emerge once the current round of profit-taking has run its course.\n\nHopes of a powerful economic bounce as lockdowns end, especially in the US, have led to a sharp rise in yields on US Treasury bonds and notes in response to those inflation fears, and investors in bonds will likely resume their selling, instead buying value stocks and also commodities like oil and copper that would benefit from an upturn.\n\nThat rise in yields will also likely continue to benefit the US Dollar even though fears that US monetary policy will be tightened soon, and that the expected package of stimulus measures will be cut back or delayed, seem wide of the mark for now.

The pair is thus within striking distance of the 2021 high set right at the start of January of just shy of the 0.7320 level. With gains of roughly 1.2% versus this US dollar, Friday is shaping up to be the kiwi\u2019s best since 9 October 2020.\n\nOn the week, the currency is now\u00a0vying for first place in the G10 ranking with GBP and AUD, all trading with weekly gains versus the US dollar of between 1.2-1.4%. On the month, NZD is the third-best performer after GBP and AUD, up about 2% versus USD.\n\nThe kiwi currently sits atop the G10 FX performance table, though specific news or events can be definitively pointed at as supporting the currency. For what its worth, Q4 PPI data released during Friday\u2019s Asia Pacific session did not appear to influence the price action much; input prices were unchanged in the quarter, down from growth of 0.6% in Q3, whilst Output price growth accelerated to 0.4% from its -0.3% contraction in Q3.\n\nMarkets have been in a generally risk-on mood on Friday and this is supporting risk-sensitive currencies such as NZD; stock markets are yet to take the recent run higher in global bond yields as a negative and the S&P 500 continues to trade comfortably above the 3900 level, not far from recent record levels. US President Joe Biden is expected to say that the US is not looking for a new cold war with China at the G7 summit, constructive commentary that may ease some concerns about the potential for relations to further deteriorate. Biden is still expected to call for democracies to challenge the country\u2019s abusive practises, however. Meanwhile, preliminary Markit PMI data for February out of Australia, the UK and US were decent, implying that the recovery in these countries remains on track as global vaccine rollouts continue. On which note, vaccine appears to lower Covid-19 infections and transmission rates by two-thirds, according to the Telegraph citing data set to be released later this month by Public Health England.\n\nWhilst the above is all very well and good for the kiwi, support also appears to be coming from movements in Australia and New Zealand\u2019s bond markets; yields in the former have surged since the start of the European session, with Australian 10-year bond yields currently up more than 7bps on the day at close to 1.49% following a change to Westpac\u2019s year-end bond yield forecast (which was revised higher to 1.9% from 1.5%. When New Zealand\u2019s bond markets re-open on Monday, similar upside is likely to be seen in bond yields there. That means the country\u2019s 10-year yield could be substantially higher than its Friday closing level at 1.517%, which was already amongst the highest yielding developed market 10-year notes.\n\nNZD/USD four hour chart\n\n\n"}, {"headline": "GBP/USD consolidates not far from 1.4000 as bulls remain in control", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/vbTee0Ei8K2.N.fTTf60gg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/f99d3bfea17cee984cdabad5d85d6ba2", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "GBP/USD is on course for its strongest one-day gain since 12 January, up more than 0.8% or about 120 pips on the day and came ever so close to touching the 1.4000 level for the first time since April 2018 midway through the European trading session. The pair has spent most of the last eight or so hours consolidating in the upper 1.3900s as bulls catch their breath ahead of what they will hope is the next leg higher for the currency pair.\n\nOn the week, GBP is far and away now the best performing currency in the G10, up nearly 1.0% versus the US dollar. That compares to the euro, which is down 0.2% and JPY which is down 0.7%. On the month, it\u2019s a similar story, with GBP the best performer and up more than 2.0% versus the US dollar. AUD is not too far behind, up 1.75% versus the US dollar, and was the best performer on the month prior to Thursday\u2019s session. GBP\u2019s stellar performance compares to the euro, which is down 0.3% and JPY, which is down 0.9%.\n\nGBP continues to benefit from vaccine optimism-related tailwinds, with the country now having surpassed 16.4M vaccine doses delivered, up nearly 500K on the day. If the government can maintain this pace, all adults should have been offered their first vaccine by the government\u2019s target of the end of May.\n\nSterling bulls are also drawing hope from the continued sharp drop in Covid-19 infections, hospitalisations and deaths in the UK. The ongoing Imperial College of London study that tests tens of thousands of UK citizens every week to estimate the prevalence of the virus in the community shows that the number of currently infected persons has dropped by two-third since the start of January to around 0.5% of the population.\n\nIt remains unclear at this point as to how much of that is down to the lockdown and how much of that is down to the vaccines. Data from Israel, whose vaccination drive is well ahead of the UK\u2019s in terms of the percentage of the population who has been vaccinated, has been conclusive in showing that vaccines do cause infections to fall. Over the next two months, the government will be expecting to see infection rates drop disproportionately in vaccinated groups versus unvaccinated groups and confirmation that this is the case, alongside falling infection rates, will set the stage for reopening.\n\nAn early reopening timetable compared to many of its major developed market peers is likely to result in UK economic outperformance, as the \u201cpost-Covid-19\u201d recovery gets started early. UK consumers have built up a large buffer of savings over the past year amid closures in the service sector (i.e. hospitality and tourism) and expectations are for pent-up demand to be unleashed over the summer.\n\nIt is worth noting some downside risks to the above-outlined scenario, however; a survey by the Resolution Foundation, released on Wednesday, showed that about 2.6M UK workers, or 8% of the workforce, expect to lose their jobs in the next three months. The UK government can keep this number down and minimise the economic damage of such losses if it opts to extend its furlough job retention scheme. But if it opts to go down the more fiscally conservative route, job losses may be a drag on the post-Covid-19 recovery.\n\nUK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak will have some hard thinking to do ahead of the unveiling of his next budget on 3 March. Most analysts expect that given the high pressure on fiscal policymakers to over rather than under-deliver across the globe, Sunak will extend the scheme. Separately, Sunak is expected to announce an extension of the business rates holiday for the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors, which had been expected to end on 31 March.\n\nMeanwhile, latest reports from the FT suggest that Sunak is going to delay a review of business rates until the Autumn budget; the review is expected to make the case for a digital sales tax to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d between online and high street retailers.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD tests recent ranges following USD rebound", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jpDnrc69C.mEvYUEtArlHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/5d45abd22f60a61155a0beab70560d4a", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "The Australian dollar drifted lower through trade on Wednesday, depressed by weakness across equities and a slew of stronger than anticipated US macroeconomic data sets.

Having disappointed in December, US consumers turned out in January marking a 5.1% uptick in spending; well above the 1% anticipated.
