"auther": "Daniel Moss", "body": "As mentioned in previous report, the haven-associated US Dollar may continue to lose ground against its major counterparts, as long-term price analysis suggests a cyclical downturn is in the offing. \n\nDXY monthly chart created using Tradingview\n\nThe chart above highlights the cyclical pattern seen in the US Dollar Index over the past 34 years, with the DXY largely adhering to what appears to be a 16-year rotation. The index set significant bottoms in 1992 and 2008. \n\nAfter bottoming out, price then seems to rebound aggressively early in the cycle, soaring 24.1% and 26.8% in 1993 and 2009 respectively, before pulling back to key support at the 88.6% Fibonacci. A 6-year period of sustained USD strength follows this counter-trend pullback, with price climbing 50.1% from the 1995 low and 42.8% from the 2011 low, to set key highs in 2001 and 2017. \n\nBearish RSI divergence in late 2002 seemed to signal the end of the US Dollar\u2019s bull run and triggered a shift in overall market sentiment, as price collapsed through uptrend support and ell 41.6% to eventually bottom in March 2008. \n\nRecent price action and the development of the RSI is strikingly similar to that seen in the first quarter of 2003 and could be indicative of further downside for the DXY, as price slices through the September 2020 low (91.75) and hurtles towards the 2018 low (88.25). \n\nAn extended downside push towards the 100% Fibonacci expansion (83.50) looks likely if the 2018 low is breached, with cycle analysis suggesting price could fall a further 23% from current levels before bottoming out in mid-2024. \n\nAUD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nThe longer-term technical outlook for AUD/USD remains overtly bullish, as price surges above the August 2020 high (0.7413) to challenge the psychologically imposing 0.7800 mark. \n\nWith the MACD hovering at its highest levels since 2011, and the RSI eyeing a push into overbought territory, the path of least resistance seems higher. \n\nA bullish \u2018golden cross\u2019 moving average formation also hints at extended gains for the exchange rate in the coming months. \n\nA weekly close above 0.7810 is required to signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and clear a path for price to challenge the 2018 high (0.8136). Hurdling that likely brings the 100% Fibonacci (0.8918) into the crosshairs. \n\nHowever, if 0.7800 successfully stifles buying pressure, a short-term pullback to the yearly low (0.7564) could be on the cards. \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 38.14% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.62 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 20.49% higher than yesterday and 0.10% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 10.93% higher than yesterday and 13.40% higher from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests AUD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is less net-short than yesterday but more net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed AUD/USD trading bias.\n\nNZD/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nNZD/USD rates also seem poised to continue pushing higher, as price storms away from the support range at 0.7100 \u2013 0.7130. \n\nThe development of the RSI hints at swelling bullish momentum, as the oscillator continues to track the uptrend extending from the March lows and eyes an entry into overbought territory.\n\nA weekly close above 0.7250 likely paves the way for buyers to drive the exchange rate towards the 61.8% Fibonacci (0.7333). Breaching that opens to door for a challenge of the 2017 high (0.7558). \n\nConversely, failing to break above the psychologically imposing 0.7300 mark could allow sellers to force NZD/USD back towards the yearly low (0.7096). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 39.33% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.54 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 15.38% higher than yesterday and 17.10% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 9.95% higher than yesterday and 2.21% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests NZD/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current NZD/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nUSD/CAD weekly chart created using Tradingview \n\nUSD/CAD looks set to extend recent losses, as price continues to track within the confines of a Descending Channel. \n\nA \u2018death cross\u2019 moving average formation, in combination with the RSI dipping to its lowest levels since 2017, suggests the path of least resistance is lower. \n\nPiercing range support at 1.2555 \u2013 1.2590 likely intensifies selling pressure and clears a path for price to challenge the 2018 low (1.2247). \n\nHowever, if support remains intact, a rebound back towards channel resistance and the 21-EMA could be in the offing (1.2599). \n\nThe IG Client Sentiment Report shows 72.92% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.69 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 11.33% higher than yesterday and 8.63% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 37.76% higher than yesterday and 19.61% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests USD/CAD prices may continue to fall.\n\nPositioning is less net-long than yesterday but more net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed USD/CAD trading bias.\n\n-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss\n"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD tests recent ranges following USD rebound", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "The Forex Market", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/jpDnrc69C.mEvYUEtArlHw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/5d45abd22f60a61155a0beab70560d4a", "auther": "The Forex Market", "body": "The Australian dollar drifted lower through trade on Wednesday, depressed by weakness across equities and a slew of stronger than anticipated US macroeconomic data sets. Having given up 0.78 US cents, the AUD remained largely range bound through the domestic session bouncing between 0.7740 and 0.7770 before marking fresh daily and weekly lows at 0.7725 following a massive upward surprise in US retail sales. Having disappointed in December, US consumers turned out in January marking a 5.1% uptick in spending; well above the 1% anticipated. The strong print was supported by gains in PPI inflation, industrial production and home sales which suggest the US economy is stronger than first anticipated. Having drifted back toward 0.7750 on open, our attentions now turn to domestic employment data. The monthly labour market report remains a crucial measure of recovery and a key marker for the RBA. Material improvements in job creation and a depreciation in unemployment would likely mean the RBA current QE program will not extend beyond September, while a poor print ahead of relaxed Jobseeker and JobKeeper benefits, next month may prompt calls for extend stimulus, weighing on the AUD. We anticipate an improvement and reduction to 6.4%.\n\nThe dollar index advanced through trade on Wednesday up 0.3% following higher bond rates and stronger than anticipated domestic retail sales. Following a soft showing in December, consumer spending rebounded strongly in January up 5.1% month on month, well beyond the 1.1% growth anticipated and raising some concerns inflation pressures may accelerate as fiscal stimulus is introduced to the economy. The dollar advanced against both the GBP and euro driving the index higher. Sterling drifted below 1.39 and touched 1.3830 before settling above 1.3850 into this morning\u2019s open. The euro slipped below 1.21 forced to lows at 1.2030.

Employment data showed employment levels are returning to near pre-pandemic levels, with the unemployment rate falling below 6.5% to 6.4% as another 30,000 jobs were added to the economy. The outlook continues to improve with most industries now reporting almost full employment, with job losses now targeted to those worst hit by the pandemic, namely tourism and entertainment. As the vaccine roll-out begins this month, there is hope forward indicators will show further growth moving into Q2, easing pressure on the RBA to maintain long run QE programs.\n\nWith little of note on the domestic docket our attentions turn to a raft of European and US PMI data. Markets are pricing in some slippage through February as lockdowns and frigid weather temper economic activity. We are keenly attuned to any divergence in economic performance; softness across European data sets could force the single currency back toward 1.20 and allow the AUD to test resistance at 0.6450.\n\nVolatility across currency markets remained subdued through trade on Thursday with little headline newsflow or data points to spark a wholesale shift in direction. The US dollar drifted lower against the euro, yen and pound with the latter extending its upward run toward 3-year highs. Sterling remains a target for investors and analysts, marking fresh highs at 1.3985 overnight.

The number of Americans filing for unemployment last week jumped from 848K to 861K, well above the 775K predicted, and a sign America\u2019s labour market still has a long way to go to recover pandemic fostered losses.\n\nOur attentions turn to a raft of manufacturing and services data across Europe and the US for direction.

With little to digest at home, the Aussie took direction from offshore outperforming early in the week. Initially the Aussie advanced as the Greenback's recent resurgence faltered in the face of rising inflation concerns spurred on by a potentially overzealous stimulus package. With the proposed package some 9% of GDP on top of the 4% of GDP proposed before Christmas there are concerns that inflation will take off. Despite the concerns, the 1-year inflation expectations figure failed to meet expectations and only rose to 1.21%, albeit still almost a yearly high for the report. Closer to home, Melbourne again entered a COVID-19 related lockdown, although for a proposed 5 days this time. Ultimately the news capped the Aussie's movements on Friday, although the broader market was sluggish in general due to Chinese New Year celebrations and a looming public holiday today in the US, Presidents' Day. Moving into a new week, the Aussie is set to enjoy a very quiet domestic docket initially with direction again to be driven by the Greenback.\n\nThe US dollar again took centre stage last week with the Greenback's behaviour dictating broader market movements. Spurred on first by rising treasury yields and lower than expected inflation levels, the Greenback initially consolidated against a basket of currencies but ultimately weakened as Federal Reserve head Powell and later US Treasury Secretary Yellen both displayed a dovish tone. The Greenback was also sold-off throughout the week as inflation concerns crept into the stimulus conversation. Nevertheless, the US dollar opens this morning at 90.45 on the US DXY and is up 0.16 against the Japanese yen and 0.07% against the Swiss franc.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the British pound turned out to be one of the better performers for the week after Q4 GDP rose by double market expectations at 1% q/q. Helped along by a softer Greenback and reports that the UK is starting to make headway in the infection rate, the Sterling rose an impressive 0.8% for the week and opens this morning at 1.3845.\n\nAUD/CAD: 0.9773 - 0.9920 \u25b2\n\nAUD/EUR: 0.6342 - 0.6437 \u25b2\n\nGBP/AUD: 1.7713 - 1.7980 \u25b2\n\nAUD/NZD: 1.0663 - 1.0824 \u25b2\n\nAUD/USD: 0.7701 - 0.7818 \u25b2\n"}, {"headline": "Euro Forecast: Why Bulls Like EUR/JPY More Than EUR/USD", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/hD.CP8K5AknbE3Yvtv_VBA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/2b1579959f6ef2083a7f7d9790ce37ea", "auther": "Christopher Vecchio", "body": "The world of FX is based on relativity, and relatively speaking, the EU is trailing other developed economies with its vaccination rates, and the EU is growing less robustly than other regions. By all considerations, the Euro is not doing well. The trio of commodity currencies crosses, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD, continue to decline, not surprising in the face of rising risk appetite. \n\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that amid the risk-on mood coursing through global financial markets, EUR/JPY rates have been able to maintain their positive momentum. This is markedly different than EUR/USD rates, which have been unable to gain traction in recent weeks like EUR/JPY (or even EUR/CHF). The key differential between EUR/JPY and EUR/USD is the shift in relative yields (FX is all about relativity, after all): JGBs remain pegged near zero, while US Treasury yields have burst higher.\n\nThe US Treasury 10-year yield continues its trek higher, now at its highest level since the start of financial markets\u2019 panic at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping it simple, as long as US Treasury yields continue to climb (and they can likely move higher into the area around 1.500%), EUR/JPY will be a better vehicle to express Euro bullishness than EUR/USD.\n\nIn the last update it was noted that \u201cthe downtrend from the nascent intrayearly highs has been broken, suggesting that the continuation effort higher is beginning.\u201d This was wrong; the pair has turned lower. \n\nTaking a step back, looking at the weekly timeframe, the rising trendline from the May and November 2020 lows is being pressured once more, which comes near: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2019 low/2020 high range at 1.1945; the August and September 2020 highs at 1.1967 and 1.2011, respectively; and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 low/2018 high range at 1.2033. It thus once again is the case that \u201cfailure below here would be a significant bearish technical development.\u201d \n\nEUR/USD: Retail trader data shows 43.98% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.27 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 1.33% lower than yesterday and 1.14% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 15.87% lower than yesterday and 11.73% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.\n\nYet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously noted that \u201cthe symmetrical triangle that\u2019s formed at the start of 2021, in context of the preceding bullish move, would suggest that EUR/JPY rates have a bias for a bullish breakout.\u201d EUR/JPY rates have broken out to the topside, trading above the rising trendline dating back to the 2012, 2016, and 2018 lows. In fact, by returning into this decade-plus symmetrical triangle, EUR/JPY rates have setup the technical posture to trade higher into 130.00 in the near-term, before attempting to break the downtrend from the 2008 (all-time high) and 2014 highs. \n\nEUR/JPY: Retail trader data shows 34.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.87 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 5.88% lower than yesterday and 1.32% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.72% higher than yesterday and 13.28% lower from last week.\n\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/JPY prices may continue to rise.\n\nPositioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EUR/JPY trading bias.\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\n"}, {"headline": "FOREX-Dollar in doldrums as vaccines fan recovery bets", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zjJP2QJtNAQrwghv2338HA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/f6990362d671426614d786ef03079407", "auther": "Data Error", "body": "Data Error"}, {"headline": "US Dollar Price Action Setups: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, USD/JPY", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Daily FX", "date": "20 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/7my6vELlhsolWkp4HPp58g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/60d/063085c9015523ec17ebca884f284d8c", "auther": "James Stanley", "body": "It was a wash week in the US Dollar as the currency is looking to finish the week very close to where it had started. It wasn\u2019t a week without volatility, however, as the USD bounced on Tuesday and Wednesday only to give back almost the entirety of those gains on Thursday and Friday. \n\nI had looked into the US Dollar during the Tuesday webinar, tracking a number of major pairs in the effort of devising strategy for the week. In this article, I\u2019ll recap those setups while updating the analysis after a few days of performance have built-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had shared that there weren\u2019t many major FX pairs that looked attractive for USD-strength scenarios. The main outlier was EUR/USD and as a secondary option, there was also USD/CAD given adherence to long-term support. But the USD then spent much of the next 24 hours rallying into the release of FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, and that seemed to help stall the move around the 91.00 level on DXY, with sellers taking over on Thursday and pushing prices right back towards the 90.00 handle. \n\nFor next week, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ignore the head and shoulders pattern that\u2019s built on the USD chart, with focus around the neckline which holds just above the 90.00 level. Head and shoulders formations are often approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns, and considering where the neckline holds around the 90.00 psychological level, a breach-below could lead to a fast move thereafter. \n\nTo learn more about how to work with head and shoulders formations, or how to work with psychological levels, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nOn the Tuesday webinar I had remarked that EUR/USD was one of the more attractive setups for USD-strength, and that filled-in fairly well with a continued sell-off on Wednesday. At the source of that argument is a key zone of resistance that\u2019s been in-play since early-December. This zone spans from 1.2134 up to 1.2167, each of which are 50% markers derived from longer-term Fibonacci studies. \n\nWhen this zone re-emerged in short-term price action on Tuesday, it led to a hold with a bearish swing. But buyers stepped in before the 1.2000 level could come into play again, and this led into a higher-low as price action simply went right back to that resistance zone. \n\nAt this stage, a hold of resistance in the zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios; but given how quickly buyers pushed prices back-up to resistance, there may soon be a topside break around-the-corner. Bears would rightfully be a bit more cautious of setting up off of this zone for next week; and there may even be some bullish breakout potential if buyers can finally push through this resistance area running from 1.2134-1.2167. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview\n\nThe British Pound was a focus area on Tuesday, as I wrote a technical report earlier in the day before digging into the major pair on the webinar that afternoon. \n\nThe big theme in GBP as noted in both instances was the brute strength that the currency had displayed, making GBP/USD as one of the more attractive short-USD candidates. But, as I had shared in the technical report, given the performance of USD/JPY, GBP/JPY may have been even more accommodative for similar stances around Sterling strength, and sure enough that breakout has outpaced that of the major pair. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on the Yen a little later in this article, as there could be continuation potential particularly with a continued push of risk-on behavior. But for GBP/USD next week, there\u2019s no signs yet of the bullish trend slowing down. The one matter of obfuscation would be price action trading above the psychological 1.4000 handle. Something like this may lead to a slowing of the bullish push, which could possibly allow for a pullback similar to what showed up on Wednesday of this week. \n\nShould that scenario arise, there are a few different areas of possible support, each marked on the below chart in blue below. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBP/USD on Tradingview\n\nSimilar to what I had said on Tuesday in which there weren\u2019t many attractive options for USD strength outside of USD/CAD; well, that situation may be extending into next week. \n\nThe item of attraction with USD/CAD, particularly for USD-strength scenarios, is the fact that long-term support continues to help hold the lows. That support shows around the 1.2622 area on the chart which is the 50% retracement of the 2002-2007 major move in the pair. \n\nThis price re-entered the equation last month and helped to set support in the pair over a few different tests. And, longer-term, there\u2019s a falling wedge formation that remains in-play and if bulls can push up for another test of resistance, the formation could be followed for a continued bullish breakout. \n\nTo learn more about falling wedges, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nThere is a counter-side to this setup, however, involving a more recent formation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower in this article. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAs longer-term price action in USD/CAD has been bouncing around inside of that falling wedge, another formation has formed, and this one actually points in the opposite direction. A recent show of horizontal support combined with lower-high resistance presents a descending triangle formation, which will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakdowns. \n\nTo learn more about the descending triangle formation, join us in DailyFX Education\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nAnother pair that may harbor some attraction for themes of USD-strength is USD/JPY. Frankly, there\u2019ve been few currencies that have been able to keep pace with USD-weakness and of recent the Japanese Yen has certainly been one, and its been like that for much of the New Year so far. \n\nPrice action in USD/JPY had built into a falling wedge coming into 2021. Buyers began to push the reversal in January, and that theme has continued so far through the first half of Q1. \n\nTo learn more about the falling wedge, check out DailyFX Education\n\nBut \u2013 as I had remarked on Tuesday, this theme of Yen-weakness may be more exciting elsewhere, particularly for traders that are looking to actively avoid the US Dollar. Pairs like AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY could be attractive for strength scenarios, largely on the basis of the Yen being a more active counterpart than what\u2019s been a messy US Dollar. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD/JPY on Tradingview\n\nGiven the recent trajectory of USD/JPY, there may be continued utility in favoring Yen-weakness over USD-weakness in the coming week. Granted \u2013 the potential for a USD-breakdown is there, taken from the head and shoulders pattern combined with the litany of fundamental themes that appear to be pushing in that direction. \n\nBut \u2013 that\u2019s just potential for now. Reality highlights the fact that the Yen already is in the midst of that trend weakness, and for traders looking at strength themes in a currency such as the British Pound or the Australian Dollar, there may be a more attractive avenue against the Yen than in the major pair. \n\nI had looked into this in last week\u2019s Analyst Pick on AUD/JPY, which has continued to break-out this week. And while both AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are pushing to fresh highs, that extra Yen-weakness, as highlighted by the USD/JPY chart above, has certainly helped to amplify the breakout in AUD/JPY. \n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; AUD/JPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX\n"}, {"headline": "U.S. Dollar Needs Retail Sales Comeback | Investing.com", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/sdmvfl_iTT6TOGV6MF0aAw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/am/365d/335e415f55e3619c5ca8c4f098db6a21", "auther": "y Kathy Lien", "body": "\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Currencies Reverse\u00a0Despite New Highs For Stocks\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 USD\u00a0Rallies On Stronger Empire State Survey But Retail Sales A Risk\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 EURO\u00a0Gives Up Gains Despite Stronger ZEW\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 AUD\u00a0Lower On Dovish RBA Minutes\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 GBP\u00a0Traders Look Ahead To Stronger CPI\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CAD\u00a0Sells Off Despite Prospect Of Stronger Inflation Data\n\u00a0\nU.S. traders came back from their long weekend on Tuesday ready for a busy trading week.
